States Supreme Court\nA. A. LEWIS & CO. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1937)\nNo. 743\nArgued: April 30, 1937Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. Franz W. Castle, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Andrew D. Sharpe, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 3, 1934, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency of income taxes for the year \n\n[301 \nU.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n 1931 against petitioners in the sum of $512.30. The Board of Tax Appeals, upon petition and after hearing, determined that there was no deficiency. Upon review, the court below, without opinion, reversed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.\n The case involves the relations of petitioners under a declaration of trust and an agreement attached thereto. And the question for decision is whether the trust constitutes an association, to be taxed as a corporation, within the meaning of section 701(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S. C.A.  1696(3), which provides that, when used in the act, 'The term 'corporation' includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insurance companies.' The commissioner, whose action was affirmed by the lower court, ruled that upon the facts stated below there was a taxable 'association' within the reach of this statutory provision. The Board of Tax Appeals held to the contrary.\n Minerva S. Melidones, hereafter called the grantor, in 1925, in order to subdivide and sell a tract of land which she owned, made the declaration of trust here in question, placing the title in the predecessor of the Central Republic Trust Company, as trustee for the use and benefit of herself and A. A. Lewis, both of whom signed the instrument as beneficiaries. The trustee was given power to deal with the real estate so far as the public was concerned, but was to do so only in accordance with the agreement attached to the trust instrument. That agreement, bearing the same date as the declaration of trust, was executed by the grantor, Lewis and the trustee. The grantor, by the agreement, appointed Lewis, an experienced real estate operator, as exclusive selling agent and as 'manager of the trust created by said deed in trust and trust agreement aforesaid'; and was given 'such powers and duties in connection with the administration of the trust as may be necessary to facilitate the sale of the said land.' He was authorized to exercise management and control of the property for the purposes of sale; \n\n[301 \nU.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n at his own expense to employ a sales organization; to enter into contracts with purchasers as manager of the trust; and to request the trustee to execute deeds and other necessary instruments. Contracts were to be made, and title was to be conveyed by the trustee to purchasers, upon Lewis' written directions. He was to receive as sole compensation for his services commissions based upon the price for which the lots in the subdivision were sold. The trustee was to collect and distribute payments after the initial payment; but was to have nothing to do with the sales of lots or negotiations relating thereto.\n The grantor subsequently assigned her beneficial interest in the trust to Benjamin Schwartz, to which his estate has succeeded as sole beneficiary. The trust instrument provides that transferrable certificates may be issued by the trustee; but none was ever issued.\n If it were not for the declaration of trust, we should have here the simple case of an appointment by a land owner of an agent to subdivide the land and sell it, receiving as compensation for his services a fixed percentage of the payments made by the purchasers. It is quite evident that such an arrangement has no element of substance or method which would warrant its designation as an association under the statutory provision in question. Nor can we see that the intervention of a trustee to hold title, execute contracts and conveyances at the direction of the real-estate agent and make collections alters the situation.\n The question recently has received full consideration in Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, and three other cases which immediately follow in the same volume.* The trust reviewed in the Morrissey Case was essentially unlike that now under consideration. There \n\n[301 \nU.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n the trust was a medium for the carrying on of a business enterprise by the trustees and participation in the profits by numerous beneficiaries whose interests were represented by transferrable share certificates, thus permitting the introduction of new participants without affecting the continuity of the plan. The certificates represented both preferred and common shares. We pointed out that the corporate analogy was evidenced by centralized control, continuity and limited liability, as well as by the issue of transferrable certificates; and we said (\n296 \nU.S. 344\n, at page 356, 56 S.Ct. 289, 295) that the word 'association' implies associates. 'It implies the entering into a joint enterprise, and, as the applicable (departmental) regulation imports, an enterprise for the transaction of business. This is not the characteristic of an ordinary trust-whether created by will, deed, or declaration-by which particular property is conveyed to a trustee or is to be held by the settlor, on specified trusts, for the benefit of named or described persons. Such beneficiaries do not ordinarily, and as mere cestuis que trust, plan a common effort or center into a combination for the conduct of a business enterprise.'\n The arrangement here answers the foregoing description of an ordinary trust-that is, it was created in virtue of a declaration by which a designated piece of real property was conveyed to the trustee on specified trusts, for the benefit of definitely named persons, one of whom was the grantor of the land and the other an agent of the grantor for the sole purpose of subdividing and selling the land. The agent was designated by name, and his powers definitely fixed in advance of their exercise. He possessed no authority beyond that expressly delegated by his principal. The trust was adopted merely as a convenient means of making effective the sales of the agent under the contract. The duties of the trustee were purely ministerial, with no power to control, direct, or \n\n[301 \nU.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n participate in, the conduct of the selling enterprise contemplated by the contract. There is to be found in the operation of the business no essential characteristic of corporate control-nothing analogous to a board of directors or shareholders, no exemption from personal liability, no issue of transferrable certificates of interest. There is simply the common relation of principal and agent, coupled with the collateral incidents of an ordinary trust. We are not able to find in the situation an 'association' within the meaning of the statute under consideration, because there are no associates and no feature 'making (the trust) analogous to a corporate organization.' \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, at page 359, 56 S.Ct. 289, 296.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Swanson v.

KENNEDY, TO USE OF BOGASH(1937)\nNo. 753\nArgued: April 30, 1937Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 390]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Horace M. Schell and Robert T. McCracken, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Harry Shapiro, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Kennedy had a first mortgage and a bank a second mortgage on old brewery property in Pennsylvania owned \n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n by a distilling company. The bank procured from petitioners fire insurance policies covering the building. Each policy states it is understood that the insured building is under foreclosure by the bank; the premium being paid by the bank, it is agreed that in event of loss, same will be adjusted with the bank and paid to it and Kennedy, mortgagee, as interest may appear. Each provides for cancellation upon request of the insured and that the company may cancel by giving insured five days' written notice. It includes the standard mortgagee clause which provides: Loss or damage shall be payable to Kennedy as mortgagee as interest may appear; insurance as to the interest of the mortgagee shall not be invalidated by any act of the mortgagor or owner; in case the mortgagor or owner shall neglect to pay premium the mortgagee shall, on demand, pay the same. The company reserves the right to cancel the policy at any time as provided by its terms, but in such case the policy is to continue in force for the benefit of the mortgagee for ten days after notice to him.\n After the bid at sheriff's sale in the foreclosure proceedings, the bank abandoned its interest in the property as worthless, notified Kennedy that it intended to cancel the policies, and suggested that he buy them. He declined to do so or to pay the bank any part of the premiums and expressed intention not to advance any money in respect of the insured building. The bank surrendered the policies for cancellation; petitioners paid it the unearned premiums. Later, and within the period for which petitioners had insured it, the building burned. Bogash acquired Kennedy's interest and, to recover on the policies, brought these suits. Upon the statements of claim and affidavits of defense, there arose questions whether Kennedy consented to or acquiesced in the surrender and cancellation of the policies and whether they were in force when the loss occurred or had been surrendered and canceled before that time. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n The parties, having introduced their evidence and agreed that the amount of the loss was $11,000, submitted their points for charge to the jury. Plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury in respect of notice to Kennedy of cancellation and surrender of the policies, consent by him that they be canceled, and to direct verdicts in favor of plaintiff for the agreed amount. Defendants requested the court to instruct the jury in respect of the right of cancellation under the policies; that, if the jury should find facts specified in the proposed instructions, its verdicts should be for defendants, and to direct the jury that, upon the pleadings and evidence, the verdicts must be for defendants. The court refused to direct for plaintiff or defendants and, without reserving for later consideration the requests for directed verdicts or any question of law, submitted the cases to the jury. It found for defendants. Plaintiff filed motions for new trial, but did not move for judgments non obstante veredicto. The court denied the motions and entered judgments for defendants.\n Plaintiff appealed; the Circuit Court of Appeals held the trial court erred in refusing to charge on points concerning notice of cancellation to Kennedy, reversed the judgments of the District Court and ordered new trials. Kennedy to Use of Bogash v. AEtna Ins. Co., 87 F.(2d) 683. But on plaintiff's application for rehearing it held that, by their requests for peremptory instructions, plaintiff and defendants assumed the facts to be undisputed and submitted to the trial judge the determination of the inferences to be drawn from the evidence and so took the cases from the jury. The court also held that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain verdicts for defendants, denied the petition for rehearing, and remanded the cases to the District Court with directions to give plaintiff judgments for the agreed amount of the loss. 87 F.(2d) 684.\n Questions presented are: Whether, by their request for directed verdicts, the parties waived their right to trial \n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n by jury; whether, by reversing the judgments for defendants and directing judgments for plaintiff, the Circuit Court of Appeals deprived defendants of that right; and, whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding that Kennedy consented to the cancellation of the policies.\n\n 1. \nThe Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that, by their requests for peremptory instructions, the parties took the cases from the jury and applied to the judge for decision of the issues of fact as well as of law. The established rule is that where plaintiff and defendant respectively request peremptory instructions, and do nothing more, they thereby assume the facts to be undisputed and in effect submit to the trial judge the determination of the inferences properly to be drawn from them. And upon review a finding of fact by the trial court under such circumstances must stand if the record discloses substantial evidence to support it. \n1\n But, as the right of jury trial is fundamental, courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver. \n2\n And unquestionably the parties respectively may request a peremptory instruction and, upon refusal of the court to direct a verdict, have submitted to the jury all issues as to which opposing inferences may be drawn from the evidence. \n3\n Here neither the plaintiff nor the defendants applied for directed verdicts without more. With their requests for peremptory instructions they submitted other requests that reason \n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n ably may be held to amount to applications that, if a peremptory instruction is not given, the cases be submitted to the jury. Indeed, we find nothing in the record to support the view that the parties waived their right of trial by jury or authorized the judge to decide any issue of fact.\n\n 2. \nThe verdicts were taken unconditionally. Plaintiff moved for new trials, but not for judgments. The court denied her motions and entered judgments for defendants. The Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to reverse and remand for new trials but was without power, consistently with the Seventh Amendment, to direct the trial court to give judgments for plaintiff. And, as before submission of the case to the jury the trial court denied plaintiff's motion for directed verdicts without reserving any question of law, neither that court nor the Circuit Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to find or adjudge that notwithstanding the verdicts plaintiff was entitled to recover. Slocum v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364, 387\n, 33 S.Ct. 523, Ann.Cas.1914D, 1029. Our decision in Baltimore & C. Line v. Redman, \n295 \nU.S. 654\n, 55 S.Ct. 890, is not applicable.\n There is another reason why the direction of judgments for plaintiff cannot stand. Under the Conformity Act, 28 U.S.C.  724 (28 U.S.C.A.  724 ), federal courts follow the practice authorized by state statutes if there be nothing in them that is incongruous with their organization or their fundamental procedure or in conflict with congressional enactment. \n4\n The applicable Pennsylvania statute provides that whenever, upon the trial of any cause, a point requiresting binding instructions has been reserved or de- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n clined, the party presenting the point may move the court for judgment non obstante veredicto; whereupon it shall be the duty of the court, if it does not grant a new trial, to enter such judgment as should have been entered upon the evidence. From the judgment thus entered, either party may appeal to the supreme or superior court which shall review the action of the court below, and enter such judgment as shall be warranted by the evidence taken in that court. \n5\n As plaintiff failed to make appropriate motions in accordance with Pennsylvania practice, the District Court did not err in failing to give plaintiff judgment notwithstanding the verdicts. 6 The Conformity Act does not extend to the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n7\n In the absence of motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdict in the lower court, the appellate court was without authority to direct entry of judgments for plaintiff.\n\n 3. \nWas the evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that, as to Kennedy's interest, the insurance terminated before the fire? As the period for which the policies were written had not expired when the loss occurred, defendants had the burden to show that the insurance was not in force at that time. Kennedy was not merely a designated beneficiary to whom was payable, as specified, insurance obtained by the bank. The mortgagee clause created a contract of insurance between him and the company and effected separate insurance upon his interest. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n Defendants do not claim that they gave Kennedy any notice of intention to cancel his insurance or that the policies had been surrendered by the bank in accordance with their terms or otherwise.\n The evidence shows: After bids were received at foreclosure sale, the bank's attorney asked Kennedy to take over the policies and, upon his refusal so to do or to pay the bank anything on account of unearned premiums, informed him that the bank intended to surrender the policies. He expressed no objection, authorization, or consent. There is no evidence that before the fire Kennedy had been notified by the bank or by the defendants, or knew, that the bank had surrendered the policies or received return premiums or that defendants attempted to cancel his insurance. The evidence is not enough to support a finding that he intended the building to become or remain uninsured or authorized the bank to act for him in respect of his insurance, or that he consented to, acquiesced in, or ratified the surrender or cancellation of the policies. Defendants do not claim that they canceled Kennedy's insurance by giving him notice in accordance with the policies. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly reversed the judgments of the District Court, but erroneously directed judgments for plaintiff.\n The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are accordingly modified by eliminating the directions to enter judgments for plaintiff and by substituting orders for new trials. It is so ordered.\n Modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Beutell v. Magone, \n157 \nU.S. 154, 157\n, 15 S.Ct. 566; Sena v.

The decree of dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 84 F.(2d) 695. We granted certiorari. November 16, 1936. \n299 \nU.S. 536, 81\n L.Ed . --. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 237]\n\u00a0\n  From the complaint it appears that plaintiff is an insurance company which had issued to the defendant Edwin P. Haworth five policies of insurance upon his life, the defendant Cora M. Haworth being named as beneficiary. The complaint set forth the terms of the policies. They contained various provisions which for the present purpose it is unnecessary fully to particularize. It is sufficient to observe that they all provided for certain benefits in the event that the insured became totally and permanently disabled. In one policy, for $10,000, issued in 1911, the company agreed, upon receiving the requisite proof of such disability and without further payment of premiums, to pay the sum insured, and dividend additions, in twenty annual installments, or a life annuity as specified, in full settlement. In four other policies issued in 1921, 1928, and 1929, respectively, for amounts aggregating $30,000, plaintiff agreed upon proof of such disability to waive further payment of premiums, promising in one of the policies to pay a specified amount monthly and in the other three to continue the life insurance in force. By these four policies the benefits to be payable at death, and the cash and loan values to be available, were to be the same whether the premiums were paid or were waived by reason of the described disability.\n  The complaint alleges that in 1930 and 1931 the insured ceased to pay premiums on the four policies last mentioned and claimed the disability benefits as stipulated. He continued to pay premiums on the first mentioned policy until 1934 and then claimed disability benefits. These claims, which were repeatedly renewed, were presented in the form of affidavits accompanied by certificates of physicians. A typical written claim on the four policies is annexed to the complaint. It states that while these policies were in force, the insured became \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 238]\n\u00a0\n totally and permanently disabled by disease and was 'prevented from performing any work or conducting any business for compensation or profit'; that on October 7, 1930, he had made and delivered to the company a sworn statement 'for the purpose of asserting and claiming his right to have these policies continued under the permanent and total disability provision contained in each of them'; that more than six months before that date he had become totally and permanently disabled and had furnished evidence of his disability within the stated time; that the annual premiums payable in the year 1930 or in subsequent years were waived by reason of the disability; and that he was entitled to have the policies continued in force without the payment of premiums so long as the disability should continue.\n  With respect to the policy first mentioned, it appears that the insured claimed that prior to June 1, 1934, when he ceased to pay premiums, he had become totally and permanently disabled; that he was without obligation to pay further premiums and was entitled to the stipulated disability benefits including the continued life of the policy.\n  Plaintiff alleges that consistently and at all times it has refused to recognize these claims of the insured and has insisted that all the policies had lapsed according to their terms by reason of the non-payment of premiums, the insured not being totally and permanently disabled at any of the times to which his claims referred. Plaintiff further states that taking loans into consideration four of the policies have no value and the remaining policy (the one first mentioned) has a value of only $45 as extended insurance. If, however, the insured has been totally and permanently disabled as he claims, the five policies are in full force, the plaintiff is now obliged to pay the accrued installments of cash disability benefits for which two of the policies provide, and the insured \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 239]\n\u00a0\n has the right to claim at any time cash surrender values accumulating by reason of the provisions for waiver of premiums, or at his death, Cora M. Haworth, as beneficiary, will be entitled to receive the face of the policies less the loans thereon.\n  Plaintiff thus contends that there is an actual controversy with defendants as to the existence of the total and permanent disability of the insured and as to the continuance of the obligations asserted despite the nonpayment of premiums. Defendants have not instituted any action wherein the plaintiff would have an opportunity to prove the absence of the alleged disability and plaintiff points to the danger that it may lose the benefit of evidence through disappearance, illness, or death of witnesses; and meanwhile, in the absence of a judicial decision with respect to the alleged disability, the plaintiff in relation to these policies will be compelled to maintain reserves in excess of $20,000.\n  The complaint asks for a decree that the four policies be declared to be null and void by reason of lapse for nonpayment of premiums and that the obligation upon the remaining policy be held to consist solely in the duty to pay the sum of $45 upon the death of the insured, and for such further relief as the exigencies of the case may require.\n  First.-The Constitution (article 3,  2) limits the exercise of the judicial power to 'cases' and 'controversies.' 'The term 'controversies,' if distinguishable at all from 'cases,' is so in that it is less comprehensive than the latter, and includes only suits of a civil nature.' Per Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Railway Commission (C.C.) 32 F. 241, 255, citing Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 431, 432. See Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 356\n, 357; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 723\n, 724, 501, 502. The Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in its limitation to 'cases of actual controversy,' manifestly \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 240]\n\u00a0\n has regard to the constitutional provision and is operative only in respect to controversies which are such in the constitutional sense. The word 'actual' is one of emphasis rather than of definition. Thus the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only. In providing remedies and defining procedure in relation to cases and controversies in the constitutional sense the Congress is acting within its delegated power over the jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is authorized to establish. Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8, 10; Stevenson v. Fain, \n195 \nU.S. 165, 167\n; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 234\n, 82, 24 A.L.R. 1077. Exercising this control of practice and procedure the Congress is not confined to traditional forms or traditional remedies. The judiciary clause of the Constitution 'did not crystallize into changeless form the procedure of 1789 as the only possible means for presenting a case or controversy otherwise cognizable by the federal courts.' Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 264\n, 348, 87 A.L.R. 1191. In dealing with methods within its sphere of remedial action the Congress may create and improve as well as abolish or restrict. The Declaratory Judgment Act must be deemed to fall within this ambit of congressional power, so far as it authorizes relief which is consonant with the exercise of the judicial function in the determination of controversies to which under the Constitution the judicial power extends.\n  A 'controversy' in this sense must be one that is appropriate for judicial determination. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 819. A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot. United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113, 116\n, 449. The controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 241]\n\u00a0\n adverse legal interests. South Spring Gold Co. v. Amador Gold Co., \n145 \nU.S. 300, 301\n; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126, 129\n, 275; Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 487\n, 488, 601. It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts. See Muskrat v. United States, supra; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 262; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 339\n, 340, 125; Liberty Warehouse Co. v.

Where there is such a concrete case admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties in an adversary proceeding upon the facts alleged, the judicial function may be appropriately exercised although the adjudication of the rights of the litigants may not require the award of process or the payment of damages.

Commissioner, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, at page 725, 502. And as it is not essential to the exercise of the judicial power that an injunction be sought, allegations that irreparable injury is threatened are not required. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, supra, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, at page 264, 348, 87 A.L. R. 1191.\n  With these principles governing the application of the Declaratory Judgment Act, we turn to the nature of the controversy, the relation and interests of the parties, and the relief sought in the instant case. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 242]\n\u00a0\n  Second-There is here a dispute between parties who face each other in an adversary proceeding. The dispute relates to legal rights and obligations arising from the contracts of insurance. The dispute is definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract. Prior to this suit, the parties had taken adverse positions with respect to their existing obligations. Their contentions concerned the disability benefits which were to be payable upon prescribed conditions. On the one side, the insured claimed that he had become totally and permanently disabled and hence was relieved of the obligation to continue the payment of premiums and was entitled to the stipulated disability benefits and to the continuance of the policies in force. The insured presented this claim formally, as required by the policies. It was a claim of a present, specific right. On the other side, the company made an equally definite claim that the alleged basic fact did not exist, that the insured was not totally and permanently disabled and had not been relieved of the duty to continue the payment of premiums, that in consequence the policies had lapsed, and that the company was thus freed from its obligation either to pay disability benefits or to continue the insurance in force. Such a dispute is manifestly susceptible of judicial determination. It calls, not for an advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, but for an adjudication of present right upon established facts.\n  That the dispute turns upon questions of fact does not withdraw it, as the respondent seems to contend, from judicial cognizance. The legal consequences flow from the facts and it is the province of the courts to ascertain and find the facts in order to determine the legal consequences. That is everyday practice. Equally unavailing is respondent's contention that the dispute relates to the existence of a 'mutable fact' and a 'changeable condition-the state of the insured's health.' The in- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 243]\n\u00a0\n sured asserted a total and permanent disability occurring prior to October, 1930, and continuing thereafter. Upon that ground he ceased to pay premiums. His condition at the time he stopped payment, whether he was then totally and permanently disabled so that the policies did not lapse, is not a 'mutable' but a definite fact. It is a controlling fact which can be finally determined and which fixes rights and obligations under the policies. If it were found that the insured was not totally and permanently disabled when he ceased to pay premiums and hence was in default, the effect of that default and the consequent right of the company to treat the policies as lapsed could be definitely and finally adjudicated. If it were found that he was totally and permanently disabled as he claimed, the duty of the company to pay the promised disability benefits and to maintain the policies in force could likewise be adjudicated. There would be no difficulty in either event in passing a conclusive decree applicable to the facts found and to the obligations of the parties corresponding to those facts. If the insured made good his claim, the decree establishing his right to the disability benefits, and to the continuance of the policies in force during the period of the proved disability, would be none the less final and conclusive as to the matters thus determined even though a different situation might later arise in the event of his recovery from that disability and his failure after that recovery to comply with the requirements of the policies. Such a contention would present a distinct subject matter.\n  If the insured had brought suit to recover the disability benefits currently payable under two of the policies there would have been no question that the controversy was of a justiciable nature, whether or not the amount involved would have permitted its determination in a federal court. Again, on repudiation by \n\n[300 \nU.S. 227\n, 244]\n\u00a0\n the insurer of liability in such a case and insistence by the insured that the repudiation was unjustified because of his disability, the insured would have 'such an interest in the preservation of the contracts that he might maintain a suit in equity to declare them still in being.' Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 680\n, 764; Cohen v. New York Life Insurance Co., 50 N.Y. 610, 624, 10 Am.Rep. 522; Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, supra. But the character of the controversy and of the issue to be determined is essentially the same whether it is presented by the insured or by the insurer. Whether the District Court may entertain such a suit by the insurer, when the controversy as here is between citizens of different States or otherwise is within the range of the federal judicial power, is for the Congress to determine. It is the nature of the controversy, not the method of its presentation or the particular party who presents it, that is determinative. See Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co. (C.C.A.) 82 F. (2d) 145, 149; Travelers Insurance Co. v. Helmer (D.C.) 15 F.Supp. 355, 356; New York Life Insurance Co. v. London (D.C.) 15 F.Supp. 586, 589.\n  We have no occasion to deal with questions that may arise in the progress of the cause, as the complaint has been dismissed in limine. Questions of burden of proof or mode of trial have not been considered by the courts below and are not before us.\n  Our conclusion is that the complaint presented a controversy to which the judicial power extends and that authority to hear and determine it has been conferred upon the District Court by the Declaratory Judgment Act. The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 687\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act provides:\n'(1) In cases of actual controversy * * * the courts of the United States shall have power upon petition, declaration, complaint, or other appropriate pleadings to declare rights and other legal relations of any interested party petitioning for such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be prayed, and such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and be reviewable as such.\n\n'(2) Further relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper.

PILLSBURY(1937)\nNo. 558\nArgued: March 9, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Eugene M. Prince and F. D. Madison, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Frank Staley, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here presented is whether an appeal to a Circuit Court of Appeals from a decree in admiralty in a District Court may be taken by simply filing in the office of the clerk of the District Court, and serving on the proctor of the adverse party, a notice of appeal. In this case the Circuit Court of Appeals, in deference to a rule adopted by it in 1900 and readopted in 1928, sustained an appeal so taken and overruled the appellee's contention that the rule is in conflict with section 8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 940, 28 U.S.C.  230 ( 28 U.S.C.A.  230); which provides: 'No writ of error or appeal intended to bring any judgment or decree before a circuit court of appeals for review shall be allowed unless application therefor be duly made within three months after the entry of such judgment or decree.'\n We are of opinion that the statute is both applicable and controlling.\n Prior to the creation of the Circuit Courts of Appeals the recognized mode of taking an appeal from a decree \n\n[301 \nU.S. 174, 176]\n\u00a0\n in admiralty, as well as from a decree in equity, was by making application to the court rendering the decree, or to a judge or justice, and obtaining an allowance of an appeal. The authorized procedure in this regard is shown in Barrel v. Transportation Company (Barrell v. The Mohawk ), 3 Wall. 424, where an appeal in admiralty was sought to be taken by simply filing a petition in the office of the clerk of the court. This Court dismissed the appeal, saying: 'The proceeding in the case is not warranted by any act of Congress, and we have no authority to act on such a petition. The filing of it in the clerk's office, even if it could be regarded as addressed to the Circuit Court, would be of no avail, unless accompanied by an allowance of an appeal by that court; and in the case before us there was no allowance.'\n The act creating the Circuit Courts of Appeals1 and investing them with stated appellate jurisdiction, including appeals in admiralty, made no change in the prior procedure. On the contrary, section 11 of that act provided: 'And all provisions of law now in force regulating the methods and system of review, through appeals or writs of error, shall regulate the methods and system of appeals and writs of error provided for in this act in respect of the circuit courts of appeals, including all provisions for bonds or other securities to be required and taken on such appeals and writs of error, and any judge of the circuit courts of appeals, in respect of cases brought or to be brought to that court shall have the same powers and duties as to the allowance of appeals or writs of error, and the conditions of such allowance, as now by law belong to the justices or judges in respect of the existing courts of the United States respectively.' 2 \n\n[301 \nU.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n The reasons for requiring that an appeal be duly applied for and allowed is that there may be some assurance that the suit is one in which there may be a review in the Circuit Court of Appeals; that the decree is of such finality or character that it may be re-examined on appeal; and that appropriate security for costs may be taken where the appellant is not by law exempted from giving such security. \n3\n In this way improvident and unauthorized appeals are provented. While an appeal in a proper case is matter of right, the question whether the case is a proper one under the law regulating appeals is not left to the appellant, but is to be examined and primarily determined by the court or judge to which the application is to be made. The reasons for thus conditioning the right of appeal have the same application to decrees in admiralty that they have to decrees in equity and judgments at law; and the act of 1925 includes one as much as another, for it says: 'No. ... appeal intended to bring any judgment or decree before a circuit court of appeals for review shall be allowed unless application therefor be duly made.' In all of the circuits other than the one in which the decision now under review was made full effect is given to this requirement. In the one circuit a rule exists whereby appeals in admiralty are excepted. But that rule contravenes the statute and has no force, for the power of a court to make rules necessarily is confined to such as are consistent with controlling laws.\n It follows that the Circuit Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to entertain the attempted appeal.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See title 28 U.S.C.  228; 28 U.S.C.A.  228 note. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Bartemeyer v.

UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 281\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. Watson Smith and Frank B. Ingersoll, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal brings up a final decree of the District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania, three judges sitting, which vacated a preliminary injunction1 and refused to restrain law officers of the United States from conducting a proceeding against appellant in another district.\n June 9, 1912, in the present cause, 'Pennsylvania Suit,' when appellant was the only defendant, a consent decree canceled certain restrictive provisions of designated contracts and forbade future violations of the anti-trust laws by it, its officers, agents, and representatives. With certain modifications (1922) presently unimportant this decree remains in force.\n April 23, 1937, the United States through their law officers, defendants here, instituted a proceeding in the Southern District of New York, 'New York Suit,' 2 wherein the appellant, its officers, agents, stockholders, and others (sixty-three in all), were named as defendants. \n1\n All of these were charged with violating the anti-trust laws and appropriate relief through injunctions, dissolution of appellant, rearrangement of its properties, etc., was asked.\n April 29, 1937, in the 'Pennsylvania Suit,' appellant asked and the District Court entered an ex parte order directing the law officers concerned with the New York suit to appear as defendants. It then filed the petition now before us wherein it prayed for an injunction restraining these officers from proceeding further in New York against it, its wholly owned subsidiaries, officers, and directors.\n The petition charged that prosecution of the later suit would subject appellant to the peril of concurrent decrees on the same subject-matter by two courts; also that there \n\n[302 \nU.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n was the possibility of conflicting decrees and unseemly conflict. The prayer for relief rested essentially upon the assertion that the suit embraced subject-matters and issues substantially identical with those previously presented and adjudicated by the consent decree of 1912\n\n\n The law officers appeared specially and answered; the Attorney General filed an expediting certificate under the Act of February 11, 1903, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A.  28, 29; a court of three judges assembled, heard evidence, made findings of fact, and denied relief. Errors were assigned; this appeal followed.\n Plainly, and there is no suggestion to the contrary, appellant cannot succeed unless the Pennsylvania and New York suits are substantially identical in subject-matter and issues. It says that comparison of the petitions in the two causes reveals this fact. Also, that comparison of the petition in the later suit with the prohibitions of the 1912 consent decree shows the alleged identity, since each charging paragraph of the petition sets up violations of the anti-trust laws inhibited by the decree.\n On the other hand, counsel for the United States submit that the two suits differ in substantial respects; defendants, charges, and relief prayed.\n The court below found: 'The subject matter, parties, issues and relief sought in the New York suit differ substantially from those in the 1912 suit. The New York suit does not attack the affirmative provisions of the 1912 decree or seek to reverse any action taken by the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in the suit of 1912. The New York suit does not subject Aluminum Company to the peril of two conflicting decrees. Aluminum Company will not suffer irreparable injury by being compelled to defend the suit in the Southern District of New York. ...' It concluded that the two suits were dissimilar in respect of parties defendant, subject-matter, issues, and relief sought, and that no basis for an injunction had been shown. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 230, 233]\n\u00a0\n We have heard counsel, examined the record and briefs, and are unable to say that the court below erred either in respect of its findings or conclusion. The findings are adequately supported and the conclusion reached, we think, is proper. For us again to analyze the pleadings, evidence, and decrees and point out the differences and necessary inferences would serve no useful purpose. This was adequately done below.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 19 F.Supp. 374. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 20 F.Supp. 13. \n\n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN LIFE INS.

Yankey, of Wichita, Kan., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In these cases suits have been brought for the cancellation of policies of life insurance on the ground of fraud in their procurement, the policies providing that they shall cease to be contestable unless contest shall be begun within a stated time. The question to be determined is the existence, in the circumstances, of a remedy in equity.\n  On February 23, 1932, petitioner, a Colorado corporation, issued to Reese Smith Stewart, a citizen of Kansas, two policies of life insurance, each for $5,000, one payable to his son, who is a respondent in No. 440, and the other payable to his wife, who is a respondent in No. 441. Each policy contains a provision that it 'shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of the premium, after one year from its date of issue if the Insured be then living, otherwise after two years from its date of issue.' On May 31, 1932, three months and eight days after obtaining the insurance, the insured died, having made in his application fraudulent misstatements, or so the insurer charges, as to his health and other matters material to the risk. On September 3, 1932, the insurer brought suit to cancel the insurance, a separate suit for each policy, the executrix of the insured being joined as a defendant with the respective beneficiaries. The complaint in each suit refers in a paragraph numbered 8 to the provision that the policy shall be incontestable after the lapse of two years. In the same paragraph it states in substance that the beneficiary may delay the commencement of the action at law till the time for contest \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 211]\n\u00a0\n has gone by, or, beginning such an action within the period, may afterwards dismiss it and then begin anew. The insurer asks the court to act while yet the barrier is down.\n  On september 26, 1932, the defendants moved in each suit to dismiss the bill for want of equity. On October 11, 1932, the beneficiaries began actions at law in the same court to recover the insurance. On October 29, the insurer filed its supplemental bills setting forth the pendency of the actions at law, and praying an injunction against their continued prosecution. On July 28, 1933, the District Court denied the motions to dismiss, without passing, however, on motions made by the insurer to enjoin the actions at law. On August 29, a stipulation was signed and filed in each case that 'the suit in equity shall be tried' by the court 'before said law action is tried, Provided, however, that the issues in said law action shall in the meantime be made up in order that said law issues thus joined shall stand ready for trial, with the understanding that said law issues, if any remain for trial, shall be tried as soon after the trial of the suit in equity as the court shall determine,' and this stipulation was approved by the court and an order made accordingly. On October 10, 1933, the defendants in each of the equity suits filed their answers to the bills, denying the fraud, admitting the making of the 'incontestability clause' as stated in paragraph 8, and as to the other allegations of that paragraph denying any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief. The answers did not state that the remedy at law was adequate.\n  Upon the trial of the suits in equity, the District Court found the fraudulent representations charged in the complaints, and decreed the cancellation and surrender of the policies. There was an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where the decree was reversed, one judge dissenting, the court holding that the insurer \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 212]\n\u00a0\n had an adequate remedy at law. 80 F.(2d) 600; 85 F.(2d) 791. We granted certiorari to settle an important question, and one likely to recur, as to the scope of equitable remedies.\n  No doubt it is the rule, and one recently applied in decisions of this court, that fraud in the procurement of insurance is provable as a defense in an action at law upon the policy, resort to equity being unnecessary to render that defense available. Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379, 385\n, 312; Adamos v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 386\n; Phoenix Mut. L. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616; Cable v. United States Life Ins. Co., \n191 \nU.S. 288, 306\n. That being so, an insurer, though the victim of a fraud, may commonly stand aside and await the hour of attack. But this attitude of aloofness may at times be fraught with peril. If the policy is to become incontestable soon after the death of the insured, the insurer becomes helpless if he must wait for a move by some one else, who may prefer to remain motionless till the time for contest has gone by. A 'contest' within the purview of such a contract has generally been held to mean a present contest in a court, not a notice of repudiation or of a contest to be waged thereafter. See, e.g., Killian v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 251 N.Y. 44, 48, 166 N.E. 798, 64 A. L.R. 956; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Hurt (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 92, 95; Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 921, 922. Accordingly an insurer, who might otherwise be condemned to loss through the mere inaction of an adversary, may assume the offensive by going into equity and there praying cancellation. This exception to the general rule has been allowed by the lower federal courts with impressive uniformity. \n1\n It \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 213]\n\u00a0\n has had acceptance in the state courts. \n2\n It was recognized only recently in an opinion of this court, though the facts were not such as to call for its allowance. Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra, \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, at page 384, 312.3\n  The argument is made, however, that the insurer, even if privileged to sue in equity, should not have gone there quite so quickly. Six months and ten days had gone by since the policies were issued. There would be nearly a year and a half more before the bar would become absolute. But how long was the insurer to wait before assuming the offensive, and how was it to know \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 214]\n\u00a0\n where the beneficiaries would be if it omitted to strike swiftly? Often a family breaks up and changes its abode after the going of its head. The like might happen to this family. To say that the insurer shall keep watch of the coming and going of the survivors is to charge it with a heavy burden. The task would be hard enough if beneficiaries were always honest. The possibility of bad faith, perhaps concealed and hardly provable, accentuates the difficulty. There are statements by judges of repute which suggest a possibility that the contest barrier may stand though the holder of the policy has gone to foreign lands. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Panagiotopoulos (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 136, 139. There are statements that it will stand though an action at law, brought within the period, has been dismissed or discontinued later. See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour (C. C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 47, 48, 73 A.L.R. 1523; Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 921, 925; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Truesdale (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 481, 485, with which contrast New York Life Ins. Co. v. Miller (C.C.A.) 73 F.(2d) 350, 355, 97 A.L.R. 562; Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 135 Kan. 381, 387, 10 P.(2d) 864, 85 A.L.R. 229, and Powell v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 313 Ill. 161, 170, 144 N.E. 825, 36 A.L.R. 1239. Whether such statements go too far we are not required to determine, for a slight variance in the facts, as, e.g., in the rule prevailing in the jurisdiction where the final suit is brought, may have a bearing on the conclusion. At least in such warnings there are possibilities of danger which a cautious insurer would not put aside as visionary. 'Where equity can give relief, plaintiff ought not to be compelled to speculate upon the change of his obtaining relief at law.' Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 558. To this must be added the danger that witnesses may disappear and evidence be lost. A remedy at law does not exclude one in equity unless it is equally prompt and certain and in other ways efficient. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 3 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 215]\n\u00a0\n Pet. 210; Drexel v. Berney, \n122 \nU.S. 241\n; Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co., \n172 \nU.S. 1\n; Union Pac. R. Co. v. Board of Com'rs of Weld County, \n247 \nU.S. 282, 287\n. 'It must be a remedy which may be resorted to without impediment created otherwise than by the act of the party.' Cable v. United States Life Ins. Co., supra, \n191 \nU.S. 288\n, at page 303, 76. Here the insurer had no remedy at law at all except at the pleasure of an adversary. There was neither equality in efficiency nor equality in certainty nor equality in promptness. 'The remedy at law cannot be adequate if its adequacy depends upon the will of the opposing party.' Bank of Kentucky v. Stone (C.C.) 88 F. 383, 391; cf. Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Hammer (C.C.A.) 41 F.(2d) 12, 16. To make a contract incontestable after the lapse of a brief time is to confer upon its holder extraordinary privileges. We must be on our guard against turning them into weapons of oppression.\n  The argument is made that the suits in equity should have been dismissed when it appeared upon the trial that after the filing of the bills, and in October, 1932, the beneficiaries of the policies had sued on them at law. But the settled rule is that equitable jurisdiction existing at the filing of a bill is not destroyed because an adequate legal remedy may have become available thereafter. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 296\n, 275; Lincoln National Life Ins. Co. v. Hammer, supra; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, supra. There is indeed, a possibility that the bringing of actions of law might have been used by the respondents to their advantage if they had not chosen by a stipulation to throw the possibility away. A court has control over its own docket. Landis v. North American Co., December 7, 1936, \n299 \nU.S. 248\n. In the exercise of a sound discretion it may hold one lawsuit in abeyance to abide the outcome of another, especially where the parties and the issues are the same. Id. If request had been made by the respondents to suspend- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 203\n, 216]\n\u00a0\n the suits in equity till the other causes were disposed of, the District Court could have considered whether justice would not be done by pursuing such a course, the remedy in equity being exceptional and the outcome of necessity. Cf. Harnischfeger Sales Corp. v. National Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 921, 922, 923. There would be many circumstances to be weighed, as, for instance, the condition of the court calendar, whether the insurer had been precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other factors. In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be set off, the one against the other, and a balance ascertained. Landis v. North American Co., supra. But respondents, as already indicated, gave that possibility away. They stipulated that the issues in equity should be tried in advance of those at law, and that only such issues, if any, as were left should be disposed of later on. The cases were allowed to stand as if challenge to the suits had been made by a demurrer only. So challenged, they prevail.\n  The decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for a consideration of the merits and for other proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] From the fourth circuit: Jefferson Standard Life Ins.

Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This is a proceeding brought in the Court of Claims by petitioner to recover a balance of $144,238.03 alleged to be due from the government under certain designated contracts. The government filed a general traverse, an \n\n[300 \nU.S. 475\n, 477]\n\u00a0\n a counterclaim for a deficiency income and excess profits tax assessment in the sum of $191,403.77. The taxes were for the year 1918, and were assessed on the 14th day of June, 1924. The court below found that the government was indebted to petitioner upon the contracts in the sum of $ 119,413.04. Upon the counterclaim the court found that the tax liability of petitioner was $82,701.29. Upon this latter sum, it allowed interest, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from the date of assessment, in the sum of $58,607.64, bringing the total allowance upon the counterclaim to the sum of $141,308.93. Judgment was given against petitioner for the difference between that sum and the sum due under the contracts; namely, $ 21,895.89. The opinion of the court will be found in 14 F.Supp. 168; and a supplemental opinion in the form of a memorandum was filed on October 5, 1936. 17 F.Supp. 215, 216. We granted certiorari, limited to the question of the allowance of interest to the government upon its counterclaim. \n300 \nU.S. 648\n.\n  In the argument here, both parties proceed upon the theory that interest was allowed under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1082, 1083,  250(e).1 The government contended below that under that section it was entitled to interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month instead of 6 per centum per annum. It abandons that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 475\n, 478]\n\u00a0\n contention here, but insists that it is entitled to at least the interest allowed by the court below.\n  It will be seen that under the findings, the government was indebted in 1924 to petitioner in the sum of $119,413.04, against which there was at the same time a just counterclaim of $82,701.29; so that, if the account had been adjusted at that time instead of 12 years later, the government would have been obliged to pay petitioner the difference between these two sums, or $36,711.75. The inequity of allowing the government interest for 12 years under these circumstances, so as to bring the petitioner in debt to the government in the sum of over $21,000, is so gross as to be shocking.\n  We have said (United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328, 339\n-340, 341, 113): 'When the United States comes into Court to assert a claim it so far takes the position of a private suitor as to agree by implication that justice may be done with regard to the subject matter. The absence of legal liability in a case where but for its sovereignty it would be liable does not destroy the justice of the claim against it. * * * The reasons are strong for not obstructing the application of natural justice against the Government by technical formulas when justice can be done without endangering any public interest.' If the principle thus stated is not strictly applicable, it at least suggests that the court should not affirm what is clearly an unjust and inequitable result unless under plain compulsion of law.\n  Section 250(e), supra, provides for the allowance of interest where the tax remains unpaid after the date when it is due and 'for ten days after notice and demand by the collector.' The court below found that on June 14, 1924, the Commissioner made the assessment 'and duly notified plaintiff with regard thereto.' It made no other finding in respect of that matter. The government contends that the finding which was made means that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 475\n, 479]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner set in motion the normal administrative machinery which resulted in a notice demanding payment, and relies upon the presumption of official regularity as being sufficient to make this finding the equivalent of a finding of notice and demand by the collector. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 186\n, 163, 101 A.L.R. 853.\n  But we are dealing here not with a presumption, but with a specific finding; and that finding should be examined in the light of the pleadings. Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 188. The amended counterclaim of the government, filed in 1927, among other things, alleges that 'the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made an additional assessment' of which the plaintiff (petitioner) was duly notified. The collector is not mentioned and no demand is alleged. Considering the finding in connection with the allegation, the former fairly may be construed as comprehending all that was done in attempted compliance with the condition imposed by section 250(e) as a prerequisite to the allowance of interest. But this is not all that appears.\n  In the memorandum supplementing the original opinion, the court below said: 'The record fails to show that any demand was made, and we cannot presume that it was. On the contrary, in view of the fact that plaintiff at the time was claiming that the defendant was indebted to it in a sum larger than the amount of the tax, it is more probable that no such demand was made.' While it is true that this court is not at liberty to refer to the opinion for the purpose of eking out, controlling or modifying the scope of the findings,2 the rule is not absolute and does not preclude reference to the opinion for all purposes whatsoever. It is well established that in case \n\n[300 \nU.S. 475\n, 480]\n\u00a0\n of ambiguity, extrinsic aid may be sought in order to settle the meaning of a statute or a contract. We see no reason why the principle of that rule does not permit reference to the opinion of the court in order to clarify the meaning of a finding otherwise in doubt. The government suggests that in such case the proper course is to remand the case to the Court of Claims in order that that court may supplement and clarify the finding and, if necessary, take additional evidence to that end. Of course, that sometimes has been done; but where, as here, the finding, the pleadings, and the opinion of the court, taken together, clearly show that section 250(e) in the particular under consideration was not complied with, it is unnecessary to follow that procedure.\n  This proceeding was originally brought in 1922. The deficiency assessment was made while the case was pending. The counterclaim of the government was first filed in 1926, and an amended counterclaim in 1927. Under these circumstances we see no reason for remanding the case upon the mere chance that the government may be able to furnish evidence which it has failed to furnish during more than a decade of litigation, and especially in respect has failed to furnish during more than a frankly conceded to be inequitable.\n  The judgment should be reversed with directions to enter judgment for petitioner, without an allowance of interest upon the counterclaim, in accordance with the foregoing opinion. So ordered.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 250. * * * (e) If any tax remains unpaid after the date when it is due, and for ten days after notice and demand by the collector, then, except in the case of estates of insane, deceased, or insolvent persons, there shall be added as part of the tax the sum of 5 per centum on the amount due but unpaid, plus interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month upon such amount from the time it became due: Provided, That as to any such amount which is the subject of a bona fide claim for abatement such sum of 5 per centum shall not be added and the interest from the time the amount was due until the claim is decided shall be at the rate of 1\/2 of 1 per centum per month. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Stone v.

Sutherland, both of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Stanley F. Reed, Sol. Gen., and James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this suit on November 22, 1935, against the collector of internal revenue to recover the amounts paid as cotton 'processing' taxes (first cause of action) and as cotton 'floor stock' taxes (second cause of action) under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 31, 35, 40. Petitioner alleged the unconstitutionality of the statute imposing the tax (United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914) and that claim for refund had been rejected by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on August 16, 1935. After the enactment of title VII of the Revenue Act of 1936,  901-917 (49 Stat. 1747, 7 U.S.C.A.  623 note, 644-659), petitioner amended its complaint, asserting the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 341]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutionality of these provisions. Demurrer was sustained by the District Court (Lincoln Mills v. Davis, 15 F.Supp. 257) and its judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that the court below was without jurisdiction to entertain the action. Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 87 F.(2d) 773. In view of the importance of the questions raised, we granted certiorari.\n Title VII, sections 901-917, of the Revenue Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C.A.  623 note 644-659) provided a new administrative procedure for the recovery of amounts collected under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Section 901 (7 U.S.C.A.  623) note) repealed sections 21(d), 21(e), and 21(g), of the amendments of 1935 (49 Stat. 771-773). Section 902 (7 U.S.C.A.  644) prescribed the conditions on which refunds should be made. Section 903 (7 U.S.C.A.  645) related to the filing of claims. Sections 904 and 905 (7 U. S.C.A.  646, 647) prescribed periods of limitation and provided for the jurisdiction of the District Courts, concurrent with the Court of Claims, for the recovery of amounts collected as floor stock and compensating taxes. Section 906 (7 U.S.C.A.  648) prescribed the procedure on claims for refunds of processing taxes. Section 907 (7 U.S.C.A.  649) established certain rules of evidence or presumptions to be observed in the administrative proceeding. Section 908 (7 U.S.C.A.  650) related to allowance of interest. Section 909 (7 U.S.C.A.  651) denied review of the administrative ruling by any other administrative or accounting officer. Section 910 (7 U.S.C.A.  652) undertook to free collectors from liability for moneys collected by him and paid into the Treasury in performance of his official duties. Section 913 (7 U.S.C.A.  655) defined various terms employed. Other sections laid down administrative rules not requiring attention in the present discussion.\n First.-Petitioner contends that at the time it brought this suit it had a vested right of action against the collector to recover the amounts exacted under statutory provisions held to be invalid; that this right of action could not be destroyed without violating the Fifth Amendment; that the collector was personally liable for \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 342]\n\u00a0\n the amounts collected and that section 910 which attempted to destroy that liability is unconstitutional.\n The government answers that the instant case 'does not require a decision as to the power of Congress to withdraw suit entirely, both against the Collector and against the Government'; that Congress 'has left a remedy against the Government which is fair and adequate in every respect.' We agree with the government's contention that if the administrative remedy is fair and adequate, other questions with respect to the liability of the collector and the validity of section 910 need not now be considered. We had occasion to deal with a cognate question in Burrill, Treasurer, v. Locomobile Company, \n258 \nU.S. 34\n, 42 S.Ct. 256, 257. That decision was rendered in suits brought by foreign corporations in the federal court to recover taxes alleged to have been paid to the defendant, the treasurer of Massachusetts, under duress and in obedience to statutes held by this Court to be unconstitutional in International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135\n, 38 S.Ct. 292, Ann.Cas.1918C, 617, and Locomobile Company v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 146\n, 38 S.Ct. 298. A statute (G.L.Mass.1921, c. 63,  77) of Massachusetts provided that any corporation aggrieved by the exaction of the tax could apply by petition to the Supreme Judicial Court and that the remedy so provided should be exclusive. As the statute contained a provision for repayment of any sum adjudged to have been illegally exacted, it was contended that it constituted a bar to a personal suit against the Treasurer who had collected the tax. This Court agreed with the defendant upon that point. The state had substituted an exclusive remedy against itself for the remedy against the treasurer and had guaranteed payment of the amount found to be due. The validity of the statute was sustained. We said that we did 'not perceive why the State may not provide that only the author of the wrong shall be liable for it, at least when, as here, the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 343]\n\u00a0\n remedy offered is adequate and backed by the responsibility of the State.'\n The same reasoning is applicable here. The government has not denied its obligation to refund the amounts found in the authorized proceeding to be recoverable, but has recognized that obligation. In such a case, the substitution of an exclusive remedy directly against the government is not an invasion of constitutional right. Nor does the requirement of recourse to administrative procedure establish invalidity if legal rights are still suitably protected. The immediate question is whether the authorized proceeding affords a fair and adequate remedy. We accordingly inquire whether the prescribed procedure gives an opportunity for a full and fair hearing and determination of all questions of fact and adequately provides for the protection of the legal rights of the claimant, embracing whatever right of refund the claimant is entitled to assert under the Federal Constitution.\n Second.-With respect to floor stock taxes, no serious question is presented as to the adequacy of the remedy. The remedy by suit is expressly preserved. If the Commissioner refuses refund, suit may be brought against the United States in the Court of Claims or in the District Court for the recovery of the amount claimed to have been illegally exacted. Section 905 (7 U.S.C.A.  647).\n Third.-With respect to the refunding of processing taxes, a special and exclusive administrative procedure is provided. Section 906, (7 U.S.C. A.  648). Disallowance by the Commissioner of a claim of refund, in whole or part, is made final unless within three months the claimant files a petition for hearing upon the merits by a Board of Review which the act establishes in the Treasury Department. The Board is composed of nine members who are officers or employees of the Department and are designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Board is 'to determine the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 344]\n\u00a0\n amount of refund due any claimant with respect to such claim.' The Commissioner is required to 'make refund of any such amount determined by a decision of the Board which has become final.' Section 906(b), 7 U.S.C.A .  648(b). The hearing, upon notice, before the Board is to be open to the public and is to be conducted by a presiding officer who is either a member of the Board or an officer or employee of the Treasury Department designated by the Secretary of the Treasury. The proceedings are to be in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the Board with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury save with respect to rules of evidence which are to be in accordance with those applicable in courts of equity of the District of Columbia. The claimant and the Commissioner are entitled 'to be represented by counsel, to have witnesses subpoenaed, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.' Provision is made to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books and papers from any place in the United States and to require the taking of depositions. Section 906(c)(d), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(c, d). The presiding officers are to recommend findings of fact and a decision to the Board or the proper division thereof within six months after the conclusion of the hearing. Briefs with respect to such recommendations may be submitted within a specified time. The Board or a division is to make its findings of fact and decision in writing as quickly as practicable. The findings and decision of a division are to become those of the Board within thirty days unless the chairman has directed that they be reviewed by the Board. Copies of the findings and decision are to be mailed to the claimant and the Commissioner. Section 906(e), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(e). There is a further provision as to costs and fees. Section 906(f), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(f). The decision of the Board is to become final in the same manner as decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals under section 1005 of the Revenue Act of 1926 as amended. Section 906(g), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(g); 26 U.S.C. 640 ( 26 U.S.C.A.  640). \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 345]\n\u00a0\n Judicial review of the decision of the Board is provided. That review may be had by a Circuit Court of Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, according to the residence or place of business of the claimant, or by any such court as may be designated by the Commissioner and the claimant by stipulation. Upon petition for review the Board is to certify and file in the appropriate court a transcript of the record upon which the findings and decision were based. Thereupon, the Court of Appeals is to have 'exclusive jurisdiction to affirm the decision of the Board, or to modify or reverse such decision, if it is not in accordance with law, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing, as justice may require.' Section 906(g), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(g). If the claimant or the Commissioner applies to the Court of Appeals for leave to adduce additional evidence the court may order it to be taken before the presiding officer if the court is satisfied that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce it at the hearing. The Board may modify its findings and decision by reason of such additional evidence, filing its modified or new determination with the court. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is to be final, subject to review by this Court upon certification or certiorari as provided in sections 239 and 240 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  346, 347).\n We think that this plan of procedure provides for the judicial determination of every question of law which the claimant is entitled to raise. We find nothing in the statute which limits the judicial review to questions of statutory construction or of mere regularity of procedure. The 'law,' with which the decision of the Board may be in conflict, may be the fundamental law. Questions of validity as well as of statutory authority or regularity may be determined. These may relate to due process in the hearing or in the refusal of a refund. The government does not contest this construction, but, on the con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 346]\n\u00a0\n trary, affirms it. The government recognizes and urges that the jurisdiction given to the Court of Appeals 'to modify or reverse' the decision of the Board 'if it is not in accordance with law' includes the power to review all questions of general and statutory law and all constitutional questions. Thus every constitutional right which the petitioner here is entitled to invoke with respect to the refund of the taxes which it has paid may be heard and determined by the Court of Appeals and ultimately by this Court upon a review of a decision reached in the course of the prescribed administrative procedure. The government urges, and we think correctly, that if on such a review any part of title VII were held to be invalid, 'the taxpayer may recover all of the taxes to which he is entitled under such a decision.' Upon the judicial review of the action of the Board, the Court of Appeals and this Court would have power 'to direct the Board to enter any designated judgment' and the Commissioner is required to make refund of any amount which may thus be determined to be due the claimant. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 347]\n\u00a0\n Fourth.-The question then is whether, despite this broad right of judicial review of the action of the Board, the administrative scheme has such inherent constitutional defects that the petitioner should not be remitted to that procedure. The inquiry has particular relation to the provisions (1) as to burden of proof, section 902, 7 U.S.C.A.  644; (2) as to presumptions, section 907, 7 U.S.C.A.  649; and (3) as to certain matters of administrative detail.\n The burden of proof. Section 902, the full text of which is set out in the margin,2 provides that no refund \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 348]\n\u00a0\n shall be allowed unless the claimant establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, or of the trial court, or of the Board of Review in cases under section 906, 7 U.S.C.A.  648 that the claimant bore the burden of the amount paid as tax and 'has not been relieved thereof nor reimbursed therefor nor shifted such burden, directly or indirectly' (1) through the inclusion of the amount paid in the price of the product; (2) through reduction of the price paid for the raw material; 'or (3) in any manner whatsoever.'\n According to the allegations of the complaint, the petitioner initially did bear the burden of the unconstitutional tax, as petitioner paid it. The question for administrative determination is whether the burden of that payment has been shifted. So far as petitioner's contention may be taken to be that it is entitled to recover by reason of the invalidity of the tax, although in fact its burden has been 'passed on' to another, the contention cannot be sustained. While the taxpayer was undoubtedly hurt when he paid the tax, if he has obtained relief through the shifting of its burden, he is no longer in a position tl claim an actual injury and the refusal of a refund in such a case cannot be regarded as a denial of constitutional right.\n That question was decided in United States v. Jefferson Electric Mfg. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 386\n, 54 S.Ct. 443, 446, and the controlling principle as to burden of proof was declared. There, actions at law had been brought, one against the United States and others against a revenue collector, to recover money alleged to have been illegally exacted as an excise tax. The ground of illegality was that the sales, with respect to which the taxes were laid, were not within the purview of the tax statute. The question concerned the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 349]\n\u00a0\n authority of the court to entertain the actions in view of the provision of section 424 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 866) relating to refunds. Properly construed that provision was taken 'as substantively limiting the right to a refund of taxes of the designated class to instances where the taxpayer either has not directly or indirectly collected the tax from the purchaser or after so collecting it has returned it to him.' This 'substantive limitation' was deemed to be 'an element of the right to a refund of such taxes,' although they were wholly invalid and not merely laid in excess of what was lawful, and hence the statute required that this element, like others, 'be satisfactorily established in any proceedings where an asserted right to a refund is presented for examination and determination.' We held that the provision was applicable to judicial as well as to administrative proceedings for refunds under the act. Id., \n291 \nU.S. 386\n, at page 395, 54 S.Ct. 443, 446. We recognized that, under the system then in force, in view of the illegality of the tax, 'there accrued to the taxpayer when he paid the tax a right to have it refunded without any showing as to whether he bore the burden of the tax or shifted it to the purchasers.' And it was further conceded that the provision of section 424 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 866) applied 'to rights accrued theretofore and still subsisting,' and subjected them to the restriction 'that the taxpayer (a) must show that he alone has borne the burden of the tax, or (b), if he has shifted the burden to the purchasers, must give a bond promptly to use the refunded sum in reimbursing them.' Id., \n291 \nU.S. 386\n, at page 401, 54 S.Ct. 443, 448. But we were unable to conclude that in imposing this restriction the section struck down prior rights or did more 'than to require that it be shown or made certain that the money when refunded will go to the one who has borne the burden of the illegal tax, and therefore is entitled in justice and good conscience to such relief.' We held that there was no infringement of due process of law in that restriction or \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 350]\n\u00a0\n in placing upon the claimant the burden of proof. We said (Id., \n291 \nU.S. 386\n, at page 402, 54 S.Ct. 443, 449):\n'If the taxpayer has borne the burden of the tax, he readily can show it; and certainly there is nothing arbitrary in requiring that he make such a showing. If he has shifted the burden to the purchasers, they and not he have been the actual sufferers and are the real parties in interest; and in such a situation there is nothing arbitrary in requiring, as a condition to refunding the tax to him, that he give a bond to use the refunded money in reimbursing them.'\n\n The opposing contention was found to be particularly faulty in that it overlooked the fact that the statutes providing for refunds proceed on the same equitable principles that underlie an action in assumpsit for money had and received. That action 'aims at the abstract justice of the case, and looks solely to the inquiry, whether the defendant holds money, which ex aequo et bono belongs to the plaintiff.' Id., \n291 \nU.S. 386\n, at page 403, 54 S.Ct. 443, 449.\n The circumstance that under title VII, here involved, there is no provision for making a refund to particular persons, to whom the burden of the invalid exaction may be found to have been shifted, presents no sound distinction so far as the claimant is concerned. The controlling principle is that there is no denial of constitutional right in requiring the claimant to show, where it can be shown, that he alone has borne the burden of the invalid tax and has not shifted it to others.\n Apart from this question, the gravamen of petitioner's complaint is that section 902 (7 U.S.C.A.  644) demands the impossible; that it sets up a condition of recovery which in petitioner's case cannot possibly be met. That is, that the statute not only requires the claimant to show that the burden of the tax has not been shifted, where that can be shown, but bars recovery where in the nature of the case that cannot be shown. Petitioner contends that it is within the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 351]\n\u00a0\n latter class. In its amended complaint, petitioner sets forth at length the features of the operation of a cotton mill such as its own. By reason of the nature of these operations petitioner asserts that there is 'an inherent impossibility' of proving whether or to what extent the burden of the taxes paid has been shifted to others.\n This allegation is at best but a statement of a legal conclusion which must depend upon the facts as they appear when proof is taken. The question is whether the petitioner is entitled to insist as a matter of constitutional right upon trying out the question of impossibility in this suit rather than in an administrative proceeding where all the pertinent facts as to the course of business may be presented and the conclusions they require both of fact and law may be reached. This assertion of such a constitutional right rests upon a construction of section 902 to the effect that if the facts, fully disclosed, afforded no basis for any determination as to the shifting of the burden of the tax, and hence gave no warrant for a finding that the burden had been shifted from the claimant to others, still the statute would require a denial of the right to a refund. The claimant would then stand, by virtue of the injury caused by the payment of the tax, not as one seeking relief when he had not been hurt, but as one who had been hurt by a payment unconstitutionally required and whose proved injury could not be said to have been redressed. It is in that aspect that the statute is assailed as leaving the claimant without remedy for a deprivation of his property without due process of law.\n Despite the broad language of section 902, we do not think that it should be construed as intended to deny a refund in any case where a claimant is constitutionally entitled to it. We apply the familiar canon which makes it our duty, of two possible constructions, to adopt the one which will save and not destroy. We cannot attribute to Congress an intent to defy the Fifth Amendment or \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 352]\n\u00a0\n 'even to come so near to doing so as to raise a serious question of constitutional law.' Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Company, \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337, 338, 32 A.L.R. 786; Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S.Ct. 391, 395; Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 148, \n276 \nU.S. 594\n, 48 S.Ct. 105, 107. When the Congress requires the claimant, who has paid the invalid tax, to show that he has not been reimbursed or has not shifted its burden, the provision should not be construed as demanding the performance of a task, if ultimately found to be inherently impossible, as a condition of relief to which the claimant would otherwise be entitled. There is ample room for the play of the statute within the range of possible determinations. Impossibility of proof may not be assumed. It cannot be doubted that the requirement has appropriate and valid effect in placing upon the claimant the duty to present fully all the facts pertaining to the question of the shifting of the burden of the tax and in denying relief where the facts justify a conclusion that the burden has been shifted from the claimant to others. When the facts have been shown it becomes the duty of the Board of Review to make its determination according to the legal rights of the claimant. That is the necessary import of the provision for judicial review, giving authority to the reviewing court to modify or reverse the decision of the Board 'if it is not in accordance with law.' Findings that can properly be made upon the evidence must thus support a decision according to legal right. And, as we have seen, the reviewing court, and finally this Court, may direct the Board 'to enter any designated judgment' 3 to which the claimant is constitutionally entitled and the Commissioner must refund the amount thus determined to be due.\n In saying this, we are not passing upon the constitutional right of petitioner to a refund or upon the question \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 353]\n\u00a0\n whether in its case the shifting of the burden of the tax is or is not 'susceptible of proof.' Constitutional questions are not to be decided hypothetically. When particular facts control the decision they must be shown. Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194\n, 208-210, 55 S. Ct. 187, 191, 192. Petitioner's contention as to impossibility of proof is premature. Manifestly there is no impossibility so far as the production of proof of petitioner's operations or course of business is concerned. What is meant by impossibility of proof is impossibility of determination after these facts are in. Whether or not any such impossibility of determination will exist is a question which properly should await the ascertainment of the facts. For the present purpose it is sufficient to hold, and we do hold, that the petitioner may constitutionally be required to present all the pertinent facts in the prescribed administrative proceeding and may there raise, and ultimately may present for judicial review, any legal question which may arise as the facts are developed.\n These considerations also dispose of the contention that section 902 'is so vague and uncertain that it is meaningless, and therefore affords no remedy.' It was not necessary for the Congress, in insisting that a claimant should not recover where it appeared that he had not borne the burden of the tax, to attempt to formulate the conclusions which would be appropriate upon varying states of fact. Petitioner's argument, drawn from the writings of economists, is itself sufficient to show the futility of such an effort. The Congress could, and did, lay down a general principle and leave its application to the facts as they would appear in particular instances in a proceeding adapted to their full disclosure. The general principle thus laid down is no more vague and indefinite than the equitable doctrine which governs the right of recovery in actions for money had and received. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 354]\n\u00a0\n The presumptions under section 907. Petitioner also contests the validity of the administrative proceeding because of the rules of evidence and presumptions which the statute establishes. Section 907 (7 U.S.C.A.  649) provides, with respect to processing taxes, that it 'shall be prima- facie evidence that the burden of such amount was borne by the claimant to the extent (not to exceed the amount of the tax) that the average margin per unit of the commodity processed was lower during the tax period than the average margin was during the period before and after the tax'; and that 'If the average margin during the tax period was not lower, it shall be prima-facie evidence that none of the burden of such amount was borne by the claimant but that it was shifted to others.'\n The 'tax period' is defined as the period in which the claimant actually paid the tax to a collector and ends with the last payment. The 'period before and after the tax' is defined as 'the twenty-four months ( except that in the case of tobacco it shall be the twelve months) immediately preceding the effective date of the processing tax, and the six months, February to July, 1936, inclusive.' Provision is made for the computation of what is called the 'average margin' for the respective periods, the 'margin' being determined by deducting from the gross sales value of articles processed the cost of the commodity processed and the processing tax.\n Petitioner contends that the presumptions are entirely arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional. There is a general allegation to that effect in petitioner's amended complaint. But it cannot be said that the comparisons set up between the results of operations during the 'tax period' and the 'period before and after the tax' are wholly irrelevant. Nor can it now be determined what will be the effect of the presumptions. While petitioner assails them, its complaint contains no allegation as to their actual effect in relation to petitioner's operations. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 355]\n\u00a0\n Non- constant but that they may work to petitioner's advantage. For all that we know, the presumption may establish prima facie that petitioner has borne the burden of the tax. Petitioner invites us to enter into a purely speculative inquiry for the purpose of condemning statutory provisions which have not been tried out and the effect of which cannot now be definitely perceived. We must decline that invitation and adhere to the fundamental principle which governs our determination of constitutional questions. Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S.Ct. 352; Cincinnati v. Vester, \n281 \nU.S. 439, 448\n, 449 S., 50 S.Ct. 360, 363; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 324\n, 56 S.Ct. 466, 472.\n The stated presumptions are rebuttable. If they work adversely to its interests, petitioner will have ample opportunity to prove all the rebutting facts. Section 907(e) provides that either the claimant or the commissioner may rebut the presumptions 'by proof of the actual extent to which the claimant shifted to others the burdens of the processing tax.' There follows a detailed provision as to what such proof may include. But the provision is not exclusive. It is expressly stated that the proof in rebuttal shall not be limited to what is thus described. Petitioner urges that the statute requires that this proof shall be of the 'actual extent' to which the burden of the tax has been shifted, and recurs to the argument as to the inherent impossibility of producing such proof. What we have already said with respect to that argument is applicable in this connection. We do not think that Congress was attempting to require the impossible. The permissible, and we think the true, construction of section 907(e) is that the words 'actual extent' are used in contradistinction to the presumed extent, according to the prima facie presumption to which the proof in rebuttal is addressed. In the light of the context, and of the entire scheme of the administrative pro- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 356]\n\u00a0\n ceeding, we are of the opinion that the provision was intended to afford, and does afford, full opportunity to the claimant to present any evidence which may be pertinent to the questions to be determined by the Board of Review and which may be appropriate to overcome any presumption which might be indulged either under section 907(a), 7 U.S.C.A.  649(a) or otherwise.\n Procedural due process in the conduct of the administrative hearing.- Petitioner also complains that under section 906(d) 7 U.S.C.A.  648(d), the hearing is to be conducted, not by the Board of Review, or a division thereof, but by a 'presiding officer' designated by the Secretary of the Treasury; and that under section 906(e), 7 U.S.C.A.  648(e), the presiding officer is to recommend to the Board, or a division, findings of fact and a decision. Petitioner urges that the Board, or its division, is not required by the statute to consider the evidence and hence that the procedure contemplated by section 906 does not meet the requirements of due process. We find no merit in these contentions. There is no provision of the statute which is necessarily inconsistent with the observance of the due process required in hearings by administrative bodies. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; United States v. Abilene & Southern Rwy. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569; Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 481 S., 56 S.Ct. 906, 911; Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292\n, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. --, decided April 26, 1937. 'The provision for a hearing implies both the privilege of introducing evidence and the duty of deciding in accordance with it.' Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, 319. Whatever the privilege or duty of the presiding officer, and whatever may be his recommendation, the statute requires that 'the Board or a division shall make its findings of fact and decision in writing' (section 906(e) and shall certify and file with the court on judicial review a transcript of the record upon which its findings and decision are based. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 337, 357]\n\u00a0\n The court has jurisdiction 'to affirm the decision of the Board, or to modify or reverse such decision.' If additional evidence is taken, 'the Board may modify its findings of fact and decision' (section 906(g) by reason of such evidence. The whole scheme of the administrative proceeding presupposes hearing and determination in accordance with the demands of due process. The Board which makes its findings and renders its decision must consider the evidence and base its findings and decision upon it, and until the contrary appears, we must assume that the Board will do so. Morgan v. United States, supra.\n We conclude that the authorized procedure provides for a full and fair hearing and determination of all matters of fact and that, through judicial review, it provides for the protection of all the legal rights of the petitioner, including any constitutional right which it may be entitled to invoke with respect to the refund which it seeks. The petitioner may thus obtain through this proceeding whatever judgment its case warrants, a judgment which the government, by virtue of the requirement that the Commissioner shall make refund accordingly, binds itself to pay.\n The judgment of dismissal is affirmed, but upon the grounds stated in this opinion. It is so ordered.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the opinion save that they reserve their vote as to the constitutional or statutory rights of the taxpayer in the event that it shall be impossible to ascertain whether there has been a shifting of the tax, an examination of those rights, in their judgment, being unnecessary now, since 'impossibility of proof,' in the language of the opinion, 'may not be assumed.'\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 58 S.Ct. 3, 82 L.Ed.-.[ Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis \n301 \nU.S. 337\n (1937) ]\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Upon this point the government states in its brief (pp. 104, 105):\n'The established rule as to be proper scope of constitutional litigation can be applied in this case with no danger of injury to petitioner. If, upon an appropriate record and in the light of an actual attempt by the taxpayer to show the incidence of the processing tax, this Court should hold any part of Title VII invalid, the taxpayer may recover all of the taxes to which he is entitled under such a decision, with interest at 6 per cent. per annum (section 908(a), 7 U.S.C.A.  650(a); section 614(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C. A.  1671 note). For, whether or not section 902 and section 907 be held invalid, the Board of Review would still remain as a mechanical means by which to enforce the decision of a circuit court of appeals or of this Court. Even if section 902 were held invalid, and recovery allowed on more proof of payment of Agricultural Adjustment Act taxes, the Board of Review would still have jurisdiction to review the allowance or disallowance of any claim, and the circuit courts of appeals and this Court would still have power to direct the Board to enter any designated judgment. And section 906(b) provides that 'the Commissioner shall make refund of any such amount determined by a decision of the Board which has become final.\" \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 902. Conditions on allowance of refunds\n'No refund shall be made or allowed, in pursuance of court decisions or otherwise, of any amount paid by or collected from any claimant as tax under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (this chapter), unless the claimant establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner in accordance with regulations prescribed by him, with the approval of the Secretary, or to the satisfaction of the trial court, or the Board of Review in cases provided for under Section 906 (section 648 of this title), as the case may be-\n\n'(a) That he bore the burden of such amount and has not been relieved thereof nor reimbursed therefor nor shifted such burden, directly or indirectly, (1) through inclusion of such amount by the claimant, or by any person directly or indirectly under his control, or having control over him, or subject to the same common control, in the price of any article with respect to which a tax was imposed under the provisions of such Act (chapter), or in the price of any article processed from any commodity with respect to which a tax was imposed under such Act (chapter), or in any charge or fee for services or processing; (2) through reduction of the price paid for any such commodity; or (3) in any manner whatsoever; and that no understanding or agreement, written or oral, exists whereby he may be relieved of the burden of such amount, be reimbursed therefor, or may shift the burden thereof; or\n\n'(b) That he was repaid unconditionally such amount to his vendee (1) who bore the burden thereof, (2) who has not been relieved thereof nor reimbursed therefor, nor shifted such burden, directly or indirectly, and ( 3) who is not entitled to receive any reimbursement therefor from any other source, or to be relieved of such burden in any manner whatsoever.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 1. \n\n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nASSOCIATED PRESS v. N.L.R.B.(1937)\nNo. 365\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis and William C. Cannon, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 117]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., of Boston, Mass., and Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are to decide whether the National Labor Relations Act,1 as applied to the petitioner by an order of the National Labor Relations Board, exceeds the power of Congress to regulate commerce pursuant to article 1,  8, abridges the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment, and denies trial by jury in violation of the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 123]\n\u00a0\n In October, 1935, the petitioner discharged Morris Watson, an employee in its New York office. The American Newspaper Guild, a labor organization, filed a charge with the Board alleging that Watson's discharge was in violation of section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  157) which confers on employees the right to organize, to form, join, or assist labor organizations to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; that the petitioner had engaged in unfair labor practices contrary to subsections (1) and (3) of section 8 (29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 3) by interfering with, restraining, or coercing Watson in the exercise of the rights guaranteed him by section 7 and by discriminating against him in respect of his tenure of employment and discouraging his membership in a labor organization. The Board served a complaint upon the petitioner charging unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of the statute. The petitioner answered admitting Watson's discharge, but denying that it was due to his joining or assisting the Guild or engaging in union activities, and denying, on constitutional grounds, the validity of the act and the jurisdiction of the Board.\n At a hearing before a trial examiner the petitioner appeared specially and moved to dismiss the complaint on constitutional grounds. The motion was overruled on all grounds except upon the question whether the proceeding was within the federal commerce power. Counsel thereupon withdrew from the hearing and the matter was further heard without the participation of the petitioner or its counsel. After receiving voluminous evidence as to the character of the petitioner's business, the examiner overruled the contention that interstate commerce was not involved and proceeded to hear the merits. At the close of the hearing he recommended that on order be entered against the petitioner. Notice of the filing of this report \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 124]\n\u00a0\n and of hearing thereon by the Board was given the petitioner but it failed to appear. Based upon the examiner's report the Board made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and entered an order that the Associated Press cease and desist from discouraging membership in the American Newspaper Guild or any other labor organization of its employees, by discharging, threatening to discharge, or refusing to reinstate any of them for joining the Guild or any other labor organization of its employees, and from discriminating against any employee in respect of hire of tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment for joining the Guild or any other such organization, and from interfering with, restraining, or coercing its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7 of the act. It further enjoined the Associated Press to offer Watson reinstatement to his former position without prejudice to any rights and privileges previously enjoyed by him; to make him whole for any loss of pay suffered by reason of his discharge; to post notices in its New York office stating it would cease and desist from the enjoined practices, and to keep such notices posted for thirty days. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner refused to comply with the order, and the Board, pursuant to section 10(e) of the act (29 U.S.C.A.  160(e), petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for enforcement. The petitioner answered again setting up its contentions with respect to the constitutionality of the act as applied to it. After argument, the court made a decree enforcing the order. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In its answer to the Board's petition for enforcement the petitioner did not challenge the Board's findings of fact and no error is assigned in this court to the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in adopting them. We, therefore, accept as established that the Associated Press \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 125]\n\u00a0\n did not, as claimed in its answer before the Board, discharge Watson because of unsatisfactory service, but, on the contrary, as found by the Board, discharged him for his activities in connection with the Newspaper Guild. It follows that section 8, subsections (1) and (3), authorize the order and the only issues open here are those involving the power of Congress under the Constitution to empower the Board to make it in the circumstances.\n First. Does the statute, as applied to the petitioner, exceed the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce? The solution of this issue depends upon the nature of the petitioner's activities, and Watson's relation to them. The findings of the Board in this aspect are unchallenged and the question becomes, therefore, solely one of law to be answered in the light of the uncontradicted facts.\n The Associated Press is a membership corporation under the laws of New York which does not operate for profit, but is a co-operative organization whose members are representatives of newspapers. It has about 1,350 members in the United States and practically all the newspapers represented in its membership are conducted for profit. Its business is the collection of news from members and from other sources throughout the United States and foreign countries and the compilation, formulation, and distribution thereof to its members. In the process the news in prepared for members' use by editing, rewriting, selecting, or discarding the information received in whole or in part. The product is transmitted to member newspapers and also to foreign agencies pursuant to mutual exchange agreements. The service is not sold, but the entire cost is apportioned amongst the members by assessment.\n Petitioner maintains its principal office in New York City, but has also division points scattered over the United \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 126]\n\u00a0\n States, each of which is charged with the duty of collecting information from a defined territory and preparing and distributing it to newspapers within the assigned area and to other division points for use within their respective areas. Each member newspaper forwards news deemed important to the divisional headquarters of its area. In addition, employees of the petitioner obtain news which is transmitted to the appropriate division headquarters to be edited and forwarded to members within the area represented by that headquarters and to other divisions for distribution to member newspapers within their respective areas. The means of communication commonly used in receiving and transmitting news consists of wires leased from telegraph and telephone companies, but messenger service, the wireless, and the mail are also employed. Each division point is connected with every other by telegraph wires for exchange of news. Regional circuits supplement these primary circuits. All these lines of communication are utilized throughout the twenty-four hours of every day.\n Consideration of the relation of Watson's activities to interstate commerce may be confined to the operations of the New York office where he was employed. This office is the headquarters of the Eastern Division and, through it operates the petitioner's foreign service, with offices, staffs, and correspondents throughout the world. News received in New York from foreign parts, from newspaper members within the Eastern Division, and from other division points, is edited by employees acting under the direction of supervising editors and, in its edited form, is transmitted throughout the division and to the headquarters of other divisions. The distributees of any given item are selected by those employed for the purpose in accordance with their judgment as to the usefulness of that item to the members or the divisions to which \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 127]\n\u00a0\n it is transmitted. Thus the New York office receives and dispatches news from and to all parts of the world in addition to that from New York state and other Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states which comprise the Eastern Division. The work of the office is divided into two departments known as the Traffic Department and the News Department. All those employed in the actual receipt and transmission of news are in the Traffic Department; all others, including editorial employees, are grouped in the News Department. Watson at the time of his discharge was in the latter class, whose duty is to receive, rewrite, and file for transmission news coming into the office. An executive news editor, assisted by supervising editors and editorial employees, has general charge of the revision of news received from so-called filing editors who are in immediate charge of the telegraph wires connecting with the sources and destination of news. These filing editors supervise the news as it goes out from New York City; they determine what news, from the total copy delivered to them, is to be sent over the wires of which they have charge to the area reached by those wires and they have charge of rewriting such copy as it comes from the other editors as may be appropriate for use in their respective circuits and the delivery of the selected and rewritten news to teletype operators for transmission over their wires. The function of editors and editorial employees such as Watson is to determine the news value of items received and speedily and accurately to rewrite the copy delivered to them, so that the rewritten matter shall be delivered to the various filing editors who are responsible for its transmission, if appropriate, to the areas reached by their circuits.\n Upon the basis of these facts the Board concluded that the Associated Press was engaged in interstate commerce; that Watson's services bore a direct relation to petitioner's \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 128]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce activities; and that labor disputes between petitioner and employees of his class and labor disturbances or strikes affecting that class of employees tend to hinder and impede interstate commerce. These conclusions are challenged by the petitioner.\n Section 2(6) of the act defines the term 'commerce' as meaning 'trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, ... or between any foreign country and any State. ...' Subsection (7) provides: 'The term 'affecting commerce' means in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.' (29 U. S.C.A.  152(6, 7.)\n The Associated Press is engaged in interstate commerce within the definition of the statute and the meaning of article 1, section 8, of the Constitution. It is an instrumentality set up by constituent members who are engaged in a commercial business for profit, and as such instrumentality acts as an exchange or clearing house of news as between the respective members and as a supplier to members of news gathered through its own domestic and foreign activities. These operations involve the constant use of channels of interstate and foreign communication. They amount to commercial intercourse and such intercourse is commerce within the meaning of the Constitution. \n4\n Interstate communication of a business nature, whatever the means of such communication, is interstate commerce regulable by Congress under the Constitution. \n5\n This conclusion is unaffected by the fact that the petitioner \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 129]\n\u00a0\n does not sell news and does not operate for profit,6 or that technically the title to the news remains in the petitioner during interstate transmission. \n7\n Petitioner being so engaged in interstate commerce the Congress may adopt appropriate regulations of its activities for the protection and advancement and for the insurance of the safety of such commerce.\n The National Labor Relations Act seeks to protect the employees' right of collective bargaining the prohibits acts of the employer discriminating against employees for union activities and advocacy of such bargaining by denominating them unfair practices to be abated in accordance with the terms of the act. As is shown in the opinion in Virginia Ry. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, the experience under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.) has demonstrated the efficacy of such legislation in preventing industrial strikes and obviating interference with the flow of interstate commerce. The petitioner, however, insists that editorial employees such as Watson are remote from any interstate activity and their employment and tenure can have no direct or intimate relation with the course of interstate commerce. We think, however, it is obvious that strikes or labor disturbances amongst this class of employees would have as direct an effect upon the activities of the petitioner as similar disturbances amongst those who operate the teletype machines or as a strike amongst the employees of telegraph lines over which petitioner's messages travel.\n In Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 433, we held a statute \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 130]\n\u00a0\n protecting the rights of collective bargaining by railway employees was within the competence of Congress under the commerce clause and that its provisions extended to clerks who had no direct contact with the actual facilities of railway transportation. We there said:\n'Exercising this authority, Congress may facilitate the amicable settlements of disputes which threaten the service of the necessary agencies of interstate transportation. In shaping its legislation to this end, Congress was entitled to take cognizance of actual conditions and to address itself to practicable measures. The legality of collective action on the part of employees in order to safeguard their proper interests is not to be disputed. It has long been recognized that employees are entitled to organize for the purpose of securing the redress of grievances and to promote agreements with employers relating to rates of pay and conditions of work. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 27 A.L.R. 360. Congress was not required to ignore this right of the employees but could safeguard it and seek to make their appropriate collective action an instrument of peace rather than of strife.'\n\n In Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, we have held an amendment of the Railway Labor Act, in all material respects analogous to the statute here under consideration, applicable to so-called backshop employees of railroads despite the contention that their employment is remote from interstate transportation.\n These decisions foreclose the petitioner's contention that Watson's employment had no relation to interstate commerce and could not be subjected to the regulatory provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.\n Second. Does the statute, as applied to the petitioner, abridge the freedom of speech or of the press safeguarded by the First Amendment? We hold that it does not. It \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 131]\n\u00a0\n is insisted that the Associated Press is in substance the press itself, that the membership consists solely of persons who own and operate newspapers, that the news is gathered solely for publication in the newspapers of members. Stress is laid upon the facts that this membership consists of persons of every conceivable political, economic, and religious view, that the one thing upon which the members are united is that the Associated Press shall be wholly free from partisan activity or the expression of opinions, that it shall limit its function to reporting events without bias in order that the citizens of our country, if given the facts, may be able to form their own opinions respecting them. The conclusion which the petitioner draws is that whatever may be the case with respect to employees in its mechanical departments it must have absolute and unrestricted freedom to employ and to discharge those who, like Watson, edit the news, that there must not be the slightest opportunity for any bias or prejudice personally entertained by an editorial employee to color or to distort what he writes, and that the Associated Press cannot be free to furnish unbiased and impartial news reports unless it is equally free to determine for itself the partiality or bias of editorial employees. So it is said that any regulation protective of union activities, or the right collectively to bargain on the part of such employees, is necessarily an invalid invasion of the freedom of the press.\n We think the contention not only has no relevance to the circumstances of the instant case but is an unsound generalization. The ostensible reason for Watson's discharge, as embodied in the records of the petitioner, is 'solely on the grounds of his work not being on a basis for which he has shown capability.' The petitioner did not assert and does not now claim that he had shown bias in the past. It does not claim that by reason \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 132]\n\u00a0\n of his connection with the union he will be likely, as the petitioner honestly believes, to show bias in the future. The actual reason for his discharge, as shown by the unattacked finding of the Board, was his Guild activity and his agitation for collective bargaining. The statute does not preclude a discharge on the ostensible grounds for the petitioner's action; it forbids discharge for what has been found to be the real motive of the petitioner. These considerations answer the suggestion that if the petitioner believed its policy of impartiality was likely to be subverted by Watson's continued service, Congress was without power to interdict his discharge. No such question is here for decision. Neither before the Board, nor in the court below nor here has the petitioner professed such belief. It seeks to bar all regulation by contending that regulation in a situation not presented would be invalid. Courts deal with cases upon the basis of the facts disclosed, never with nonexistent and assumed circumstances.\n The act does not compel the petitioner to employ any one; it does not require that the petitioner retain in its employ an incompetent editor or one who fails faithfully to edit the news to reflect the facts without bias or prejudice. The act permits a discharge for any reason other than union activity or agitation for collective bargaining with employees. The restroration of Watson to his former position in no sense guarantees his continuance in petitioner's employ. The petitioner is at liberty, whenever occasion may arise, to exercise its undoubted right to sever his relationship for any cause that seems to it proper save only as a punishment for, or discouragement of, such activities as the act declares permissible.\n The business of the Associated Press is not immune from regulation because it is an agency of the press. The publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the application of general laws. He has no special privi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 133]\n\u00a0\n lege to invade the rights and liberties of others. He must answer for libel. \n8\n He may be punished for contempt of court. \n9\n He is subject to the anti-trust laws. \n10\n Like others he must pay equitable and nondiscriminatory taxes on his business. \n11\n The regulation here in question has no relation whatever to the impartial distribution of news. The order of the Board in nowise circumscribes the full freedom and liberty of the petitioner to publish the news as it desires it published or to enforce policies of its own choosing with respect to the editing and rewriting of news for publication, and the petitioner is free at any time to discharge Watson or any editorial employee who fails to comply with the policies it may adopt.\n Third. The contentions that the act deprives the petitioner of property without due process, that the order of the Board deprives petitioner of the right to trial by jury, and that the act is invalid on its face because it seeks to regulate both interstate and intrastate commerce, are sufficiently answered in the opinion in Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, supra, and in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. --, decided this day, and need no further discussion here.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I think the judgment below should be reversed.\n One of the points made in the court below, and assigned as error here is that the statute involved, as applied, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 134]\n\u00a0\n abridges the freedom of the press in violation of the First Amendment.\n The Associated Press is engaged in collecting, editing, and distributing news to its members, publishers of some 1300 newspapers throughout the United States. These newspapers represent many diverse policies and many differences in point of view. It, obviously, is essential that the news furnished should not only be without suppression, but that it should be, as far as possible, free from color, bias, or distortion. Such is the long-established policy of the Associated Press. If the Congressional act here involved, upon its face or in its present application, abridges the freedom of petitioner to carry its policy into effect, the act to that extent falls under the condemnation of the First Amendment. We shall confine ourselves to that question, the gravity of which is evident; but we do not mean thereby to record our assent to all that has been said with regard to other questions in the case.\n The first ten amendments to the Constitution safeguard the fundamental rights therein mentioned from every form of unpermitted federal legislation. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment protects the person against deprivation of life, liberty, or property except by due process of law. 'Liberty' is a word of wide meaning, and, without more, would have included the various liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353\n, 57 S.Ct. 255, January 4, 1937, and cases cited; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 243-245, 56 S.Ct. 444, 446, 447; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 627; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 534\n, 535 S., 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 39 A.L. R. 468.\n But the framers of the Bill of Rights, regarding certain liberties as so vital that legislative denial of them should be specifically foreclosed, provided by the First Amendment: \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 135]\n\u00a0\n 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'\n The difference between the two amendments is an emphatic one and readily apparent. Deprivation of a liberty not embraced by the First Amendment, as for example the liberty of contract, is qualified by the phrase 'without due process of law'; but those liberties enumerated in the First Amendment are guaranteed without qualification, the object and effect of which is to put them in a category apart and make them incapable of abridgment by any process of law. That this is inflexibly true of the clause in respect of religion and religious liberty cannot be doubted; and it is true of the other clauses save as they may be subject in some degree to rare and extreme exigencies such as, for example, a state of war. Legislation which contravenes the liberties of the First Amendment might not contravene liberties of another kind falling only within the terms of the Fifth Amendment. Thus, we have held that the governmental power of taxation, one of the least limitable of the powers, may not be exerted so as to abridge the freedom of the press (Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra), albeit the same tax might be entirely valid if challenged under the 'liberty' guaranty of the Fifth Amendment, apart from those liberties embraced by the First. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 482\n, 483 S., 31 S.Ct. 265, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671.\n No one can read the long history which records the stern and often bloody struggles by which these cardinal rights were secured, without realizing how necessary it is to preserve them against any infringement, however slight. For, as Mr. Justice Bradley said in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 'illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 136]\n\u00a0\n by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure . ... It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their motto should be obsta principiis.' 'Experience should teach us,' it was said in another case, 'to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.' Olmstead v. United States ( dissent), \n277 \nU.S. 471, 479\n, 48 S.Ct. 570, 572, 66 A.L.R. 387. A little water, trickling here and there through a dam, is a small matter in itself; but it may be a sinister menace to the security of the dam, which those living in the valley below will do well to heed.\n The destruction or abridgment of a free press-which constitutes one of the most dependable avenues through which information of public and governmental activities may be transmitted to the people-would be an event so evil in its consequences that the least approach toward that end should be halted at the threshold.\n The grants of the Constitution always are to be read in the light of the restrictions. Thus, the exercise of the power to make laws on the subject of bankruptcies, the exercise of the war powers, of the power to tax, of the power to exclude aliens, or of the power to regulate commerce, is each subject to the qualified restrictions of the Fifth Amendment ( Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 589\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 863, 97 A.L.R. 1106); as each, also, is subject, so far as appropriate, to the unqualified restrictions of the First. Congress has no power to regulate the relations of private employer and employee as an end in itself, but only if that be an appropriate and legitimate means to a constitutional end, which here is the regulation of interstate commerce. Assuming that the statute upon its face satisfies this test, does the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 137]\n\u00a0\n present application of it satisfy the requirement that the freedom of the press shall not be abridged?\n Freedom is not a mere intellectual abstraction; and it is not merely a word to adorn an oration upon occasions of patriotic rejoicing. It is an intensely practical reality, capable of concrete enjoyment in a multitude of ways day by day. When applied to the press, the term freedom is not to be narrowly confined; and it obviously means more than publication and circulation. If freedom of the press does not include the right to adopt and pursue a policy without governmental restriction, it is a misnomer to call it freedom. And we may as well deny at once the right of the press freely to adopt a policy and pursue it, as to concede that right and deny the liberty to exercise an uncensored judgment in respect of the employment and discharge of the agents through whom the policy is to be effectuated.\n In a matter of such concern, the judgment of Congress-or, still less, the judgment of an administrative censor-cannot, under the Constitution, be substituted for that of the press management in respect of the employment or discharge of employees engaged in editorial work. The good which might come to interstate commerce or the benefit which might result to a special group, however large, must give way to that higher good of all the people so plainly contemplated by the imperative requirement that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press.'\n The present case illustrates the necessity for the enforcement of these principles. The board found, in effect, that the actual reason for Watson's discharge was his activity as a member of a labor organization in the furtherance of its aims. Accepting this as a true statement of the reason for the discharge, let us consider the question from the standpoint of that finding; although, as already indicated, we are of opinion that the constitutional im- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 138]\n\u00a0\n munity of the press does not permit any legislative restriction of the authority of a publisher, acting upon his own judgment, to discharge any one engaged in the editorial service. Such a restriction of itself would be an abridgment of the freedom of the press no less than a law restricting the constitutional liberty of one to speak would be an abridgment of the freedom of speech.\n For many years there has been contention between labor and capital. Labor has become highly organized in a wide effort to secure and preserve its rights. The daily news with respect to labor disputes is now of vast proportions; and clearly a considerable part of petitioner's editorial service must be devoted to that subject. Such news is not only of great public interest; but an unbiased version of it is of the utmost public concern. To give a group of employers on the one hand, or a labor organization on the other, power of control over such a service is obviously to endanger the fairness and accuracy of the service. Strong sympathy for or strong prejudice against a given cause or the efforts made to advance it has too often led to suppression or coloration of unwelcome facts. It would seem to be an exercise of only reasonable prudence for an association engaged in part in supplying the public with fair and accurate factual information with respect to the contests between labor and capital, to see that those whose activities include that service are free from either extreme sympathy or extreme prejudice one way or the other. And it would be no answer to say that dealing with news of this character constitutes only a part of the duties of the editorial force. The interest of a juror, for example, in the result which excludes him from sitting in a case, may be small and the adverse effect upon his verdict by no means certain. Nevertheless, the party affected cannot be called upon to assume the hazard. In the present case, by a parity of reasoning, the hope of benefit to a cherished cause which may bias the edi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 139]\n\u00a0\n torial employee is a contingency the risk of which the press in the exercise of its unchallengable freedom under the Constitution may take or decline to take, without being subject to any form of legislative coercion.\n What, then, are the facts here involved? Morris Watson was employed by petitioner first in 1928 as a reporter and rewrite editor in petitioner's Chicago office. In 1930, he was transferred to the New York office, and there served as editorial employee until his discharge on October 18, 1935. One of his duties was to rewrite and supervise the news received at the New York office and determine what portion of it should be sent to points outside. As the court already has pointed out, he had authority to determine the news value of items received and was required to speedily and accurately rewrite the copy delivered to him.\n In November, 1933, Watson was instrumental in organizing the Associated Press Unit of the New York Newspaper Guild, a labor organization, constituting a part of the American Newspaper Guild; and he was, from the beginning, recognized as the outstanding union representative of the press associations. He served successively as chairman of the Associated Press Unit and as treasurer and secretary of the New York Guild, and at the time of his discharge was vice president for wiring services of the American Guild. His guild activities were immediately objected to by petitioner; and thereafter, on numerous occasions, these activities were objected to by petitioner's executives and inducements were held out to him to abandon them. The findings of the board disclose that Watson continued in various ways to promote the interests of the guild; and there is no doubt that his sympathies were strongly enlisted in support of the guild's policies, whether they clashed with the policies of petitioner or not. We do not question his right to assume and maintain that attitude. But, if petitioner con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 140]\n\u00a0\n cluded, as it well could have done, that its policy to preserve its news service free from color, bias, or distortion was likely to be subverted by Watson's retention, what power has Congress to interfere in the face of the First Amendment?\n And that question may not be determined by considering Watson only; for the power to compel his continuance in the service includes the power to compel the continuance of all guild members engaged in editorial work, with the result that the application of the statute here made, if carried to the logical extreme, would give opportunity for the guild to exercise a high degree of control over the character of the news service. Due regard for the constitutional guaranty requires that the publisher or agency of the publisher of news shall be free from restraint in respect of employment in the editorial force. And we are dealing here not with guild members employed in the mechanical or purely clerical work of the press, but with those engaged as Watson was in its editorial work and having the power thereby to affect the execution of its policies.\n An illustration may be helpful: The right to belong to a labor union is entitled to the shield of the law, but no more so than the right not to belong. Neither can be proscribed. So much must be true, or we do not live in a free land. Let us suppose the passage of a statute of like character with that under review, having the same objective, but to be effected by forbidding the discharge of employees on the ground not that they are but that they are not members of a labor association. Let us suppose further that a labor association is engaged in publishing an interstate-circulated journal devoted to furthering the interests of labor, and that members of its editorial staff, resigning their membership in the association, transfer their allegiance from the cause of the workingman to that of the employer. Can it be doubted that an order re- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 103, 141]\n\u00a0\n quiring the reinstatement of an editorial writer who had been discharged under these circumstances would abridge the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment?\n And if that view of the amendment may be affirmed in the case of a publication issued for the purpose of advancing a particular cause, how can it be denied in the case of a press association organized to gather and edit the news fairly and without bias or distortion for the use of all causes? To hold that the press association must await a concrete instance of misinterpretation of the news before it can act is to compel it to emperiment with a doubt when it regards certainty as essential.\n The concclusion that the First Amendment is here infringed does not challenge the right of employees to organize, to bargain collectively with their employers about wages and other matters respecting employment, or to refuse to work except upon conditions they are willing to accept. Nor, the First Amendment aside, does it challenge the act in so far as it is an allowable regulation of interstate commerce. All affirmations in respect of these matters may be fully conceded without prejudice to our very definite view that the application of the act here has resulted in an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of the press.\n Do the people of this land-in the providence of God, favored, as they sometimes boast, above all others in the plenitude of their liberties- desire to preserve those so carefully protected by the First Amendment: liberty of religious worship, freedom of speech and of the press, and the right as freemen peaceably to assemble and petition their government for a redress of grievances? If so, let them withstand all beginnings of encroachment. For the saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was time. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, U.S.C.Supp. I, tit. 29,  151 et seq.

SCARLETT(1937)\nNo. 505\nArgued: March 3, 1937Decided: March 29, 1937\n\n\n  Messrs. H. K. Lockwood and Robert Brennan, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n[ Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Scarlett   \n300 \nU.S. 471\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 471\n, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. Louis E. Goodman, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This is an action under the Federal Safety Appliance Act (Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160,  2 and 3 (36 Stat. 298 (45 \nU.S.C.A.  11, 12)*), brought by Scarlett against the railway company to recover damages for a personal injury resulting from an alleged violation of the act. It also was generally alleged that the injury was due to the negligence of the railway company. Scarlett was employed as a brakeman. While descending from a box car by means of a ladder attached to the side of the car, his foot slipped on a round brace rod, also attached to the side of the car immediately behind the ladder, and he fell to the ground, thereby sustaining the injury for which damages were sought.\n  The ladder itself was not defective. In its structure it complied with the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission made in pursuance of the act. 'United States Safety-appliance Standards'-order of March 13, 1911. It is unnecessary to set forth these regulations. The only one important here prescribes-'Minimum clearance of treads, (shall be) two ( 2), preferably two- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 471\n, 473]\n\u00a0\n and-one-half (2 1\/2), inches.' The round brace rods with which the car was equipped extended outward from the wall of the car a distance of more than an inch. These brace rods operated to strengthen the walls of the car. That was their only purpose; and there is no doubt as to their necessity for that purpose. The brace rod in question ran down the side of the car at an angle of about 45 . The ladder overlay the brace rod, and cleared its outermost surface by more than the prescribed 2 1\/2 inches.\n  Scarlett's contention is that the brace rod is a part of the ladder, and by reason of its slant and rounded shape made the descent of the ladder insecure. At the trial, he abandoned his claim based upon negligence, and put his case wholly on the ground that the round diagonal brace rod and the ladder combined to constitute an unsafe appliance within the meaning of the act, and that, in consequence, the liability of the railway company was absolute. The case was submitted to the jury by the trial court upon that theory, and a verdict and judgment against the company resulted. That judgment the court below affirmed on appeal. (Cal. Sup.) 60 P.(2d) 462.\n  The record shows that brace rods, generally flat in shape, are in practically universal use on box cars. The company here formerly used a flat rod; but finding that such a rod frequently buckled, sometimes immediately under the ladder, it was abandoned and the stronger and less elastic round type was adopted in its place. This was in 1924; and the proof shows that for many years cars so equipped have been in general and constant operation on its lines. The general foreman of the company, having charge of all the car repairs at one of the principal shops, and who inspected a thousand cars each month, testified that he had never heard of an accident attributable or claimed to be attributable to the round brace rod, except \n\n[300 \nU.S. 471\n, 474]\n\u00a0\n in the present case. The record shows nothing to the contrary.\n  In the light of the long-continued use of brace rods of the type here in question in the same relation to the ladder as is the case here, we may fairly presume that the Interstate Commerce Commission in the performance of its duties was aware of the situation, and knowingly permitted its rule in respect of the ladder clearance to remain without change. Compare Pennell v. Phila. & Reading Ry. Co., \n231 \nU.S. 675, 680\n. The regulation having been made by the commission in pursuance of constitutional statutory authority, it has the same force as though prescribed in terms by the statute. And the railway company having strictly complied with the regulation has discharged its full duty so far as the ladder requirement of the Safety Appliance Act is concerned. The judgment of the trial court and jury cannot be substituted for that of the commission. See Kansas City So. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 456\n, 457, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1; Napier v.

Williams, \n242 \nU.S. 462, 466\n, 129, we held that section 2 of the act (45 \nU.S.C.A.  11) requiring secure ladders, etc., was operative pending action by the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 3 (45 \nU.S.C.A.  12). In the interim, we said, section 2 had the effect of prescribing an absolute and imperative duty, of making the ladders and other appliances 'secure'; but that section 3 contemplated that these appliances 'shall ultimately conform to a standard to be prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission; that is, that they shall be standardized.'\n  We do not see how it reasonably can be said that the brace road constitutes a part of the ladder. In itself, it \n\n[300 \nU.S. 471\n, 475]\n\u00a0\n was a contrivance separate and distinct from the ladder, designed and used for a purpose entirely apart from the use of that appliance. The right of recovery, if any, must therefore rest upon the effect of the near proximity of the ladder to the rod, neither being in itself defective. The law to be applied to that situation is the common-law rule of negligence, and not the inflexible rule of the Safety Appliance Act; and the questions to be answered are whether the two appliances were maintained in such relation to one another as to constitute negligence on the part of the company and, if so, whether Scarlett assumed the risk. Ford v. New York, N. H. & H.R. Co., supra; Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Benson, 352 Ill. 195, 199, 185 N.E. 244; Slater v. Chicago, St. P., M. & O. Ry. Co., 146 Minn. 390, 392, 393, 178 N.W. 813. In that view, Scarlett in abandoning his claim under the common-law rule of negligence abandoned the only possible ground of recovery.\n  Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n301 \nU.S. 712\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Section 2, so far as pertinent, provides that '* * * all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards, and all cars having ladders shall also be equipped with secure handholds or grab irons on their roofs at the tops of such ladders.'\n  Section 3 requires the Interstate Commerce Commission, within a time fixed, to designate the number, dimensions, location and manner of application of the appliances provided for in the foregoing section.

COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA(1937)\n\nArgued: October 11, 1937Decided: November 8, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. Justin Moore and Lewis F. Powell, Jr., both of Richmond, Va., for appellant.\n Messrs. Abram P. Staples, of Roanoke, Va., and W. W. Martin, of Richmond, Va., for the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Atlantic Refining Company is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in refining and selling gasoline and petroleum which it markets throughout the United States and in foreign countries. In 1929 the year's sales aggregated more than $153,000,000. Prior to 1930 the company had never applied for permission to do business in Virginia. It had not done any intrastate business there; and had no property or place of business within the State. It had done some interstate business, but had not paid, or been requested by the State to pay, either an entrance fee or taxes. In January, 1930, the company applied to the State Corporation Commission for a certificate of authority to do intrastate business. Its net assets were then $132,196,275; its authorized capital $100,000,000; its issued capital $ 67,049,500. The Commission granted the certificate; but, as prescribed by chapter 53, p. 79,  38a of the Act of Assembly of Virginia, 1910; Tax Code of Virginia (Michie, 1930, p. 2185)  207, set forth in the margin,1 exacted for the privilege $5,000 as an entrance \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n fee. Payment was made under protest. Having duly claimed that by requiring it the statute violated the Federal Constitution, the company requested refund of the amount paid. The Commission refused to make the refund; the highest court of the State affirmed its order, 165 Va. 492, 183 S.E. 243; and the case is here on the company's appeal. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n Answering the company's statement under rule 12 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 354), the Commonwealth opposed our taking jurisdiction. Its objection was that the appeal presented no substantial federal question, since, in 1918, the validity of the statute was challenged under similar circumstances and sustained by a unanimous Court in General Railway Signal Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 500\n, 38 S.Ct. 360; and, in 1928, was again sustained by a per curiam opinion, in Western Gas Construction Co. v. Virginia, \n276 \nU.S. 597\n, 48 S.Ct. 319. The company asks us to overrule these decisions, contending that they are inconsistent with other and later cases. It asserts that in sustaining the Virginia statute this Court followed views expressed in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 87\n, 34 S.Ct. 15; and that the doctrine of the Baltic Case has since been repudiated, in Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203, 218\n, 45 S.Ct. 477, 481, 44 A.L.R. 1219, and Cudahy Packing Co. v. Hinkle, \n278 \nU.S. 460, 466\n, 49 S.Ct. 204, 206. Consideration of the jurisdiction of this Court was postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n By the statute foreign corporations are divided, for the purpose of fixing the amount of the entrance fee, into twelve classes. The fee for the lowest class-those whose authorized capital stock is $50,000 or less- is $30. The fee for the highest class-those whose authorized capital stock exceeds $90,000,000-is $5,000. The company does not object to the subject or the occasion of the exaction. Its objection is solely to the measure. Its claim is that the statute imposes an unconstitutional condition because it determines the amount of the fee by the amount of the company's authorized capital. The contention is that a fee so determined necessarily burdens interstate commerce, denies due process, and denies equal protection of the laws.\n Unlike the cases in which the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions has been applied, the condition here \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n questioned does not govern the corporation's conduct after admission. But it may be assumed that the rule declared in Terral v. Burke Construction Co., \n257 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S.Ct. 188, 21 A.L.R. 186, is applicable also to conditions to be performed wholly before admission; and that the $5,000 must be refunded if its exaction involved denial of any constitutional right. For we are of opinion that in refusing to grant the authority to carry on local business except upon payment of the $5,000 no constitutional right of the company was violated.\n First. Virginia recognized the constitutional right of the company to carry on interstate business without paying an entrance fee. On the other hand, the company conceded that the Federal Constitution does not confer upon it the right to engage in intrastate commerce in Virginia unless it has secured the consent of the State. Compare Hemphill v. Orloff, \n277 \nU.S. 537, 548\n, 48 S.Ct. 577, 579. Whether the privilege shall be granted to a foreign corporation is a matter of state policy. Virginia might refuse to grant the privilege for any business, or might grant the privilege for some kinds of business and deny it to others. \n2\n It might grant the privilege to all corporations with small capital while denying the privilege to those whose capital or resources are large. It might grant the privilege without exacting compensation; or it could insist upon a substantial payment as a means of raising revenue.\n As the entrance fee is not a tax, but compensation for a privilege applied for and granted, no reason appears why the State is not as free to charge $5,000 for the privilege as it would be to charge that amount for a \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n franchise granted to a local utility, or for a parcel of land which it owned. If Virginia had the power to charge $5,000 for the privilege, the particular measure applied by the Legislature in arriving at that sum would seem to be legally immaterial; and the company is in a position like that of the taxpayer in Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 680\n, 18 S.Ct. 229, 232, of whom it was said: 'His right is limited solely to the inquiry whether, in the case which he presents, the effect of applying the statute is to deprive him of his property without due process of law.' The validity even of a tax 'can in no way be dependent upon the mode which the state may deem fit to adopt.' Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 600\n, 10 S.Ct. 593, 595. 'The selected measure may appear to be simply a matter of convenience in computation ... and if the tax purports to be laid upon a subject within the taxing power of the state, it is not to be condemned by the application of any artificial rule.' Kansas City, Fort Scott & Memphis Ry. Co. v. Botkin, \n240 \nU.S. 227, 233\n, 36 S.Ct. 261, 262. Compare Ray Consolidated Copper Co. v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 45 S.Ct. 526, 527; New York v. Latrobe, \n279 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 49 S.Ct. 377, 379, 65 A.L.R. 1341\n\n\n Second. Even if the Federal Constitution conferred upon every foreign corporation the right to enter any State and carry on there a local business upon paying a reasonable fee, there is nothing in the record to show that the $5,000 charged is more than reasonable compensation for the privilege granted. The payment required is a single, nonrecurrent charge-a payment in advance for a privilege extending into the long future. No matter how large the company's local business may be, no matter how much, or how often, its issued capital may be increased, no additional entrance fee is payable. The value of such a privilege cannot be gauged by the sales expected in the year 1930.3 They may increase \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n rapidly from year to year. The corporation with $132,196,275 assets in 1930 may have more than double the amount a decade later. Nor is it unreasonable to base the fee upon the amount of the capital authorized at the time of the application, instead of charging a fee based upon the amount of the capital then issued, or upon the amount of assets then owned, and exacting later additional fees if, and when, more capital stock is issued or more assets are acquired. By fixing the fee in accordance with the capital authorized at the time of the application for admission, the State relieves itself of the necessity of keeping watch of changes in the future in these respects.\n Third. It is contended that a fee measured solely by the amount of the corporation's authorized capital stock necessarily burdens interstate commerce. In support of that contention it is said that the authorized capital stock represents property located in forty-seven States and several foreign countries used in both interstate and foreign commerce. But this is not true. Authorized capital has no necessary relation to the property actually owned or used by the corporation; furthermore, the fee for which it is the measure represents simply the privilege of doing a local business. Because the entrance fee does not represent either property or business being done, it is immaterial that in fixing its amount no apportionment is made between the property owned or the business done within the State and that owned or done elsewhere.\n The entrance fee is obviously not a charge laid upon interstate commerce; nor a charge furtively directed against interstate commerce; nor a charge measured by such commerce. Its amount does not grow or shrink according to the volume of interstate commerce or the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n amount of the capital used in it. The size of the fee would be exactly the same if the company did no interstate commerce in Virginia or elsewhere. The entrance fee is comparable to the charter, or incorporation, fee of a domestic corporation-a fee commonly measured by the amount of the capital authorized. \n4\n It has never been doubted that such a charge to a domestic corporation whatever the amount is valid, although the company proposes to engage in interstate commerce and to acquire property also in other States. No reason is suggested why a different rule should be applied to the entrance fee charged this foreign corporation.\n Fourth. It is contended that a statute which measures the entrance fee solely by the authorized capital deprives the corporation of its property without due process, be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n cause the amount is determined by reference to property beyond the taxing jurisdiction; and also that this charge is an arbitrary taking of property. As has been shown, the amount of the entrance fee is not measured by property, either within or without the jurisdiction; and it is not a tax upon property. It is payment for an opportunity granted. Nor is it a charge arbitrary in amount. The value of the privilege acquired is obviously dependent upon the financial resources of the corporation-not only upon the capital possessed at the time of its admission to do business, but also upon the capital which it will be in a position to secure later through its existing author- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n ity to issue additional stock. Obviously, the power inherent in the possession of large financial resources is not dependent upon, or confined to, the place where the assets are located. Compare Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412\n, 57 S.Ct. 772. Great power may be exerted by the company in Virginia although it has little property located there. And the value to it of the privilege to exert that power is not necessarily measured by the amount of the property located, or by the amount of the local business done, in Virginia. Moreover, it is immaterial whether the opportunity is availed of or not. The State grants a large privilege. It may demand a corresponding price.\n Fifth. It is contended that the statute by measuring the entrance fee solely by the authorized capital is void because it operates arbitrarily and unequally between the appellant and other foreign corporations seeking the same privilege within the State. The contention is unfounded. Even if a corporation which has not yet been admitted to do business were in a position to complain that the State denies it equal protection, there is here no basis for a claim of discrimination. Every foreign corporation with an authorized capital exceeding $90,000,000 which seeks admission to do an intrastate business is, and has been since 1910, required to pay the same entrance fee. Nor is there any discrimination between foreign corporations and domestic of which the company may complain. While the charter fees of domestic corporations are smaller than the entrance fees of foreign corporations, Virginia levies upon foreign corporations, after admission, less in taxes than it does upon domestic corporations. A domestic corporation with an authorized capital of $100,000,000 is required to pay a charter fee of only $600; but it must pay each year a franchise tax of $8,850. A foreign corporation of that authorized capital is required to pay an entrance fee of $5,000, but pays no franchise tax whatever. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n The difference in the powers of a State over entrance fees and taxes was pointed out in Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 510\n, 511 S., 47 S.Ct. 179, 183, 49 A.L.R. 713: 'In subjecting a law of the state which imposes a charge upon foreign corporations to the test whether such a charge violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a line has to be drawn between the burden imposed by the state for the license or privilege to do business in the state and the tax burden which, having secured the right to do business, the foreign corporation must share with all the corporations and other taxpayers of the state. With respect to the admission fee, so to speak, which the foreign corporation must pay to become a quasi citizen of the state and entitled to equal privileges with citizens of the state, the measure of the burden is in the discretion of the state, and any inequality as between the foreign corporation and the domestic corporation in that regard does not come within the inhibition of the Fourteenth Amendment; but after its admission, the foreign corporation stands equal, and is to be classified, with domestic corporations of the same kind.'\n Sixth. The position of the company in the case at bar differs radically from that of the foreign corporation involved in Cudahy Packing Co. v. Hinkle, supra, and from those in the other decisions of this Court on which appellant relies. In each of those cases the corporation had, before the exaction held unconstitutional, entered the State with its permission to do local business and pursuant to that permission had acquired property and made other expenditures. Their property and the local business were found to be so closely associated with this interstate business done there that the exaction burdened it. The exaction, although called in some of those cases a filing fee, was in each case strictly a tax; for it was imposed after the admittance of the corporation into the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 22, 33]\n\u00a0\n State. \n5\n In the case at bar the situation is different. In 1930, when the company applied for the permission to do local business, it had no property whatsoever within the State. It had never done any local business there. Its product had been marketed locally in Virginia by two other foreign corporations which had been duly admitted to do local business, and whose facilities the company had used in connection with its interstate business. The company wished to make a change. It wanted to acquire the property and business of the two corporations which were marketing its product and thereafter to carry on the local business itself. In order to do so it sought permission of the State to engage in local business. The State in no way attempted to impose an additional burden upon the company or otherwise to change the conditions under which it was operating. Virginia insisted merely that, if the company wished to change the existing conditions, it should comply with the statute enacted fourteen years before the company began to do business there.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 207.

SECRETARY OF JUSTICE(1937)\nNo. 214\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. Pedro G. Glagen, of Manila, P.I., for petitioner. \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 411]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Eugene M. Caffey, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by petitioner against respondents in the Court of First Instance of Manila, for a writ of mandamus commanding respondents to approve and order payment of a gratuity awarded to him by section 7 of the Retirement Gratuity Law (Act 4051, Laws of the Philippines), notwithstanding the veto of that section by the Governor-General. The Court of First Instance, upon respondents' demurrer, dismissed the action. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Philippines affirmed that decision, holding that the veto by the Governor-General of section 7 was authorized by section 19 of the Organic Act of August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. 545, 551 (48 U.S.C.A.  1052, 1053). 28 Phil. --. Because of the importance of the question, we granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 526\n, 57 S.Ct. 29, 81 L.Ed. --.\n The Retirement Gratuity Law contains twelve sections. It is entitled, 'An Act to provide for the payment of retirement gratuities to officers and employees of the Insular Government retired from the service as a result of the reorganization or reduction of personnel thereof, including the justices of the peace who must relinquish office in accordance with the provisions of Act numbered Thirty-eight Hundred and Ninety-nine, and for other purposes.'\n Section 1 classifies the officers and employees, separated or retired from the service, who shall be entitled to a gratuity, and provides a method for ascertaining the amount. Section 2 accords preferences in the case of certain officers and employees; section 3 fixes the basis for the computation of the gratuity; section 4 allows an officer or employee to choose between the gratuity granted by the act and \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n gratuities conferred by other acts; section 5 provides for succession in respect of unpaid gratuities in case of death; and section 6 authorizes a conditional reappointment of persons separated or retired under the act.\n Section 8-passing for the present section 7-abolishes the offices and positions vacated by the separation or retirement of officers and employees, with certain exceptions. Section 9 excepts from the benefits of the act designated officers and employees. Section 10 provides: 'The necessary sum to carry out the purposes of this Act is hereby appropriated out of any funds in the Insular Treasury not otherwise appropriated.' Section 11 fixes the effective date of the act; and section 12 provides that, if any provision of the act be disapproved by the Governor-General or be held unconstitutional or invalid by a competent court, none of the other sections or provisions of the act shall be affected thereby.\n The Governor-General returned the act with the indorsement, 'Approved, section 7 excepted, February 21, 1933.' Section 7, thus vetoed, reads:\n'The Justices of the Peace who must relinquish office during the year nineteen hundred and thirty-three in accordance with the provisions of Act Numbered Thirty-eight hundred and ninety-nine, shall also be entitled to the gratuities provided for in this Act.'\n\n Section 19 of the Organic Act, supra, confers upon the Governor- General the usual and general veto power. That is to say, it authorizes him, if he does not approve a bill or joint resolution passed by both houses of the Legislature, to 'return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated'; and it then can become law only if upon reconsideration two-thirds of the members elected to each house shall agree to pass it. This general power requires the veto to include the whole bill. But the section contains an exception, namely:\n'The Governor General shall have the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation bill, but \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object.'\n\n This exceptional power, it will be seen, is limited to appropriation bills; any other kind of legislation being controlled by the general rule. And its exercise is restricted to the disapproval of a particular item or particular items of such a bill. The precise question for consideration, therefore, is, Did the bill which became Act 4051 constitute an appropriation bill; and, if so, was section 7, within the meaning of the foregoing provision of the Organic Act, an item of such bill'\n It first is to be observed that the title of the act in no wise suggests that what follows is an appropriation bill; and an examination of the act itself discloses that, with the exception of section 10, the bill itself proposed only general legislation. Eliminating section 10, the remaining eleven sections could stand as a generic act of legislation, leaving the specific matter of appropriation to be dealt with by later enactment. The term 'appropriation act' obviously would not include an act of general legislation; and a bill proposing such an act is not converted into an appropriation bill simply because it has had engrafted upon it a section making an appropriation. An appropriation bill is one the primary and specific aim of which is to make appropriations of money from the public treasury. To say otherwise would be to confuse an appropriation bill proposing sundry appropriations of money with a bill proposing sundry provisions of general law and carrying an appropriation as an incident. The Supreme Court of Texas in Fulmore v. Lane, 104 Tex. 499, 512, 140 S.W. 405, 412, 1082, clearly pointed out the distinction between the veto power in respect of a bill in the general sense and an appropriation bill. 'Nowhere in the Constitution,' the court said, 'is the authority given the Governor to approve in part and disapprove in part a bill. The only additional authority to disapproving a bill in whole is \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n that given to object to an item or items, where a bill contains several items of appropriation. It follows conclusively that where the veto power is attempted to be exercised to object to a paragraph or portion of a bill other than an item or items, or to language qualifying an appropriation or directing the method of its uses, he exceeds the constitutional authority vested in him, and his objection to such paragraph, or portion of a bill, or language qualifying an appropriation, or directing the method of its use, becomes non-effective.'\n If the Governor-General had power under the foregoing clause of section 19 of the Organic Act to veto section 7 of the gratuities bill, he had like power to veto section 2, granting preferences to certain classes of officers and employees; or section 4, allowing a choice between the gratuity granted by the act under review and a gratuity granted by some other act; or section 5, according a right of succession to unpaid gratuities in case of death; or section 6, providing for conditional reappointment of persons separated or retired under the act; or to veto as many of them as he saw fit. No more than any of the designated sections does section 7 constitute an item of appropriation. All of them are distinct parts of an act of general legislation. The elimination of any by an exercise of the veto power, with the going into effect of the remaining portions of the bill as a consequence (if the veto be not overruled by a two-thirds vote of each house), would result in the enactment of a general law in an emasculated form not intended by the Legislature and against the will, perhaps, of a majority of each house. This would not be negation of an item or items of appropriation by veto but, in effect, affirmative legislation by executive edict.\n So, even if it be conceded that the bill could be characterized as an appropriation bill, section 7 is not an 'item' within the meaning of section 19 of the Organic Act. An item of an appropriation bill obviously means an item which in itself is a specific appropriation of money, not some gen- \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n eral provision of law which happens to be put into an appropriation bill. Provisions granting power to the executive to veto an item or items of an appropriation bill are to be found, in various forms of expression, in many of the state constitutions. Their object is to safeguard the public treasury against the pernicious effect of what is called 'log-rolling'-by which, in order to secure the requisite majority to carry necessary and proper items of appropriation, unnecessary or even indefensible items are sometimes included.\n Section 73 of the Constitution of Mississippi provides that the Governor may veto parts of any appropriation bill; and, although 'parts' would seem to be a word of wider application than the words 'item or items,' the Supreme Court of that state, State v. Holder, 76 Miss. 158, 180, 181, 23 So. 643, 644, held that it was not designed to enable the Governor to veto legislation carried in an appropriation bill. 'Section 73,' the court said, 'was framed with a view of guarding against the evils of omnibus appropriation bills securing unrighteous support from diverse interests, and to enable the governor to approve and make law some appropriations, and to put others to the test of securing a two-thirds vote of the legislature as the condition of becoming law. Thus viewed, section 73 is eminently wise, and will prove useful in practice, as corrective of an evil; but if a single bill, making one whole of its constitutent parts 'fitly joined together,' and all necessary in legislative contemplation, may be dissevered by the governor, and certain parts, torn from their connection, may be approved, and thereby become law, while the other parts, unable to secure a two-thirds vote in both houses, will not become law, we shall have a condition of things never contemplated, and appalling in its possible consequences.'\n The court below attached importance to section 12 of the act under review, which provides that, if any section or pro- \n\n[299 U.S. 410, 416]\n\u00a0\n vision of the act be disapproved by the Governor-General or held to be unconstitutional or invalid by a competent court, none of the other sections or provisions should be affected thereby. That court viewed the italicized clause of this provision as indicating that the Legislature intended the act 'to be an appropriation measure with various items,' since it anticipated the possibility of a partial veto. Just why this clause was inserted by the Legislature does not appear. It may have been merely formal, or inserted out of abundance of caution. Certainly it could not have such force as to convert what plainly was a proffer of general legislation into an appropriation bill. Although the title is only a formal part of an act, and may be resorted to as an aid to the meaning of a statute only in cases of doubt, Hadden v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 107, 110, the title of the present act, at least, has the effect of overcoming such extrinsic aid as the clause relied upon otherwise might afford to the construction of the act by the court below. If the Philippine Legislature regarded the bill as an appropriation bill, it is strange that the words by which that body described and characterized its own proposed act afford no hint to that effect. Compare Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 462\n, 463 S., 12 S.Ct. 511.\n We conclude that the Governor-General was without power to separately veto section 7 of the Retirement Gratuities Act. The judgment of the lower court must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERMAN v. UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 26\nArgued: November 9, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel H. Kaufman, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Mr. Wm. W. Barron, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On conviction upon an indictment containing several counts for using the mails to defraud (18 U.S.C.  338 (18 U.S.C.A.  338)) and for conspiracy to that end (18 U.S.C.  88 (18 U.S.C.A.  88)), petitioner was sentenced on each count to serve a year and a day, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. Execution of the sentence was suspended and petitioner was placed on probation for two years. Petitioner appealed from the sentence.\n While the appeal was pending and without its withdrawal, petitioner, fearing its dismissal, applied to the District Court for resentence. That court reimposed the prior sentence of imprisonment, again supending its execution, and added a fine of $1 upon each count. The court did not vacate the prior sentence. Petitioner then appealed from the second sentence.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that, by reason of suspension of its execution, the first sentence was interlocutory and dismissed the first appeal. Assuming that appeal to be a nullity, the Court of Appeals thought that the District Court had power to resentence; that petitioner could not complain of the fine as it was imposed at his request; and that the second sentence of imprisonment, if taken alone, was interlocutory. The judgment imposing the fine was affirmed and the appeal from the second sentence of imprisonment was dismissed. 88 F.2d 645.\n We are of the opinion that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the first appeal as interlocutory. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced. Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence. The sentence is the judgment. Miller v. Aderhold, \n288 \nU.S. 206, 210\n, 53 S.Ct. 325; Hill v. United States ex rel. Wampler, \n298 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 56 S.Ct. 760, 762. Here, the imposition of the sentence was not suspended, but only its execution. The sentence was not vacated. It stood as a final determination of the merits of the criminal charge. To create finality it was necessary that petitioner's conviction should be followed by sentence (Hill v. Wampler, supra) but when so followed the finality of the judgment was not lost because execution was suspended. In criminal cases, as well as civil, the judgment is final for the purpose of appeal \n\n[302 \nU.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n 'when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits' and 'leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.' St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S.R.R. Co. v. Southern Express Co., \n108 \nU.S. 24, 28\n, 2 S.Ct. 6, 8; United States v. Pile, \n130 \nU.S. 280, 283\n, 9 S.Ct. 523; Heike v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 423, 429\n, 30 S.Ct. 539.\n Petitioner stands a convicted felon and unless the judgment against him is vacated or reversed he is subject to all the disabilities flowing from such a judgment. The record discloses that petitioner is a lawyer and by reason of his conviction his license was subject to revocation (and petitioner says that he has been disbarred) without inquiry into his guilt or innocence. Matter of Ackerson, 218 App.Div. 388, 392, 218 N.Y.S. 654. His civil rights may be determined solely by reference to the judgment.\n Placing petitioner upon probation did not affect the finality of the judgment. Probation is concerned with rehabilitation, not with the determination of guilt. It does not secure reconsideration of issues that have been determined or change the judgment that has been rendered. Probation or suspension of sentence 'comes as an act of grave to one convicted of a crime.' Escoe v. Zerbst, \n295 \nU.S. 490, 492\n, 493 S., 55 S.Ct. 818, 819. The considerations it involves are entirely apart from any re-examination of the merits of the litigation. Probation was designed 'to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender'; 'to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable.' Thus probation cannot be demanded as a right. 'The defendant stands convicted; he faces punishment, and cannot insist on terms or strike a bargain.' Burns v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 216, 220\n, 53 S.Ct. 154, 155. But, if final judgment determining his guilt has been rendered, he still has the opportunity to seek by appeal a reversal of that judgment and thus to secure not an opportunity to reform but vindication. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n As the first sentence was a final judgment and appeal therefrom was properly taken, the District Court was without jurisdiction during the pendency of that appeal to modify its judgment by resentencing the prisoner. Draper v. Davis, \n102 \nU.S. 370\n, 371; Keyser v. Farr, \n105 \nU.S. 265\n, 266; Spirou v. United States (C.C.A.) 24 F.2d 796, 797; United States v. Radice (C.C.A.) 40 F.2d 445, 446; United States v. Habib (C.C.A.) 72 F.2d 271.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed so far as it dismissed the first appeal and affirmed the later judgment imposing the fine, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLAIR V. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1937)\nNo. 247\nArgued: January 5, 1937Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n [ Blair v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue   \n300 \nU.S. 5\n (1937)  ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n  Messrs. J. F. Dammann and Wm. B. McIlvaine, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n  Mr. David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 7]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents the question of the liability of a beneficiary of a testamentary trust for a tax upon the income which he had assigned to his children prior to the tax years and which the trustees had paid to them accordingly.\n  The trust was created by the will of William Blair, a resident of Illinois who died in 1899, and was of property located in that State. One- half of the net income was to be paid to the donor's widow during her life. His son, the petitioner Edward Tyler Blair, was to receive the other one- half and, after the death of the widow, the whole of the net income during his life. In 1923, after the widow's death, petitioner assigned to his daughter, Lucy Blair Linn, an interest amounting to $6,000 for the remainder of that calendar year, and to $9,000 in each calendar year thereafter, in the net income which the petitioner was then or might thereafter be entitled to receive during his life. At about the same time, he made like assignments of interests, amounting to $9,000 in each calendar year, in the net income of the trust to his daughter Edith Blair and to his son, Edward Seymour Blair, respectively. In later years, by similar instruments, he assigned to these children additional interests, and to his son William McCormick Blair other specified interests, in the net income. The trustees accepted the assignments and distributed the income directly to the assignees.\n  The question first arose with respect to the tax year 1923, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that the income was taxable to the petitioner. The Board of Tax Appeals held the contrary. 18 B.T.A. 69. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board, holding that under the law of Illinois the trust was a spendthrift trust \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 8]\n\u00a0\n and the assignments were invalid. Commissioner v. Blair, 60 F.(2d) 340. We denied certiorari. \n288 \nU.S. 602\n.\n  Thereupon the trustees brought suit in the superior court of Cook county, Illinois, to obtain a construction of the will with respect to the power of the beneficiary of the trust to assign a part of his equitable interest and to determine the validity of the assignments he had made. The petitioner and the assignees were made defendants. The Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, after a review of the Illinois decisions, decided that the trust was not a spendthrift trust and upheld the assignments. Blair v. Linn, 274 Ill.App. 23. Under the mandate of the appellate court, the superior court of Cook county entered its decree which found the assignments to be 'voluntary assignments of a part of the interest of said Edward Tyler Blair in said trust estate' and as such adjudged them to be valid.\n  At that time there were pending before the Board of Tax Appeals proceedings involving the income of the trust for the years 1924, 1925, 1926, and 1929. The Board received in evidence the record in the suit in the state court and, applying the decision of that court, the Board overruled the Commissioner's determination as to the petitioner's liability. 31 B.T.A. 1192. The Circuit Court of Appeals again reversed the Board. That court recognized the binding effect of the decision of the state court as to the validity of the assignments but decided that the income was still taxable to the petitioner upon the ground that his interest was not attached to the corpus of the estate and that the income was not subject to his disposition until he received it. Commissioner v. Blair, 83 F.(2d) 655, 662.\n  Because of an asserted conflict with the decision of the state court, and also with decisions of circuit courts of appeals, we granted certiorari. October 12, 1936.\n  First. The Government contends that the judgment relating to the income for 1923 is conclusive in this pro- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 9]\n\u00a0\n ceeding as res judicata. Tait v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 620\n. Petitioner insists that this question was not raised before the Board of Tax Appeals and hence was not available before the Circuit Court of Appeals. General Utilities Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 187; Helvering v. Savage, \n297 \nU.S. 106, 109\n, 376. The Government respondents that the answers before the Board of Tax Appeals in the instant case had been filed before the first decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was entered, and that, while the case was heard before the Board without amended pleadings, the whole matter was actually before the Board and the question of res judicata was raised by an assignment of error on the petition for review before the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  It is not necessary to review the respective contentions upon this point, as we think that the ruling in the Tait Case is not applicable. That ruling and the reasoning which underlies it apply where in the subsequent proceedings, although relating to a different tax year, the questions presented upon the facts and the law are essentially the same. Tait v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., supra, \n289 \nU.S. 620\n, at pages 624, 626, 707, 708. Here, after the decision in the first proceeding, the opinion and decree of the state court created a new situation. The determination of petitioner's liability for the year 1923 had been rested entirely upon the local law. Commissioner v. Blair (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 340, 342, 344. The supervening decision of the state court interpreting that law in direct relation to this trust cannot justly be ignored in the present proceeding so far as it is found that the local law is determinative of any material point in controversy. Compare Freuler v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 35\n; Hubbell v. Helvering ( C.C.A.) 70 F.(2d) 668.\n  Second. The question of the validity of the assignments is a question of local law. The donor was a resident of Illinois and his disposition of the property in that State was subject to its law. By that law the character \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 10]\n\u00a0\n of the trust, the nature and extent of the interest of the beneficiary, and the power of the beneficiary to assign that interest in whole or in part, are to be determined. The decision of the state court upon these questions is final. Spindle v. Shreve, \n111 \nU.S. 542, 547\n, 548; Uterhart v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 598, 603\n; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 110\n; Freuler v. Helvering, supra, \n291 \nU.S. 35\n, at page 45, 312. It matters not that the decision was by an intermediate appellate court. Compare Graham v. White-Phillips Co., \n296 \nU.S. 27, 56\n S. Ct. 21, 102 A.L.R. 24. In this instance, it is not necessary to go beyond the obvious point that the decision was in a suit between the trustees and the beneficiary and his assignees, and the decree which was entered in pursuance of the decision determined as between these parties the validity of the particular assignments. Nor is there any basis for a charge that the suit was collusive and the decree inoperative. Freuler v. Helvering, supra. The trustees were entitled to seek the instructions of the court having supervision of the trust. That court entertained the suit and the appellate court, with the first decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals before it, reviewed the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State and reached a deliberate conclusion. To derogate from the authority of that conclusion and of the decree it commanded, so far as the question is one of state law, would be wholly unwarranted in the exercise of federal jurisdiction.\n  In the face of this ruling of the state court it is not open to the Government to argue that the trust 'was, under the Illinois law, a spendthrift trust.' The point of the argument is that, the trust being of that character, the state law barred the voluntary alienation by the beneficiary of his interest. The state court held precisely the contrary. The ruling also determines the validity of the assignment by the beneficiary of parts of his interest. That question was necessarily presented and expressly decided. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 11]\n\u00a0\n  Third. The question remains whether, treating the assignments as valid, the assignor was still taxable upon the income under the federal income tax act. That is a federal question.\n  Our decisions in Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\nu, and Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, are cited. In the Lucas Case the question was whether an attorney was taxable for the whole of his salary and fees earned by him in the tax years or only upon one-half by reason of an agreement with his wife by which his earnings were to be received and owned by them jointly. We were of the opinion that the case turned upon the construction of the taxing act. We said that 'the statute could tax salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skilfully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it.' That was deemed to be the meaning of the statute as to compensation for personal service and the one who earned the income was held to be subject to the tax. In Burnet v. Leininger, supra, a husband, a member of a firm, assigned future partnership income to his wife. We found that the revenue act dealt explicitly with the liability of partners as such. The wife did not become a member of the firm; the act specifically taxed the distributive share of each partner in the net income of the firm; and the husband by the fair import of the act remained taxable upon his distributive share. These cases are not in point. The tax here is not upon earnings which are taxed to the one who earns them. Nor is it a case of income attributable to a taxpayer by reason of the application of the income to the discharge of his obligation. Old Colony Trust Company v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n; Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 62, 101 A.L.R. 391; Helvering v. Stokes, \n296 \nU.S. 551\n; Helvering v. Schweitzer, \n296 \nU.S. 551\n; Helvering v. Coxey, 297 \nU.S. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 12]\n\u00a0\n 694. See, also, Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 677\n, 763. There is here no question of evasion or of giving effect to statutory provisions designed to forestall evasion; or of the taxpayer's retention of control. Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n; Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280\n.\n  In the instant case, the tax is upon income as to which, in the general application of the revenue acts, the tax liability attaches to ownership. See Poe v. Seaborn, supra; Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n.\n  The Government points to the provisions of the revenue acts imposing upon the beneficiary of a trust the liability for the tax upon the income distributable to the beneficiary. \n1\n But the term is merely descriptive of the one entitled to the beneficial interest. These provisions cannot be taken to preclude valid assignments of the beneficial interest, or to affect the duty of the trustee to distribute income to the owner of the beneficial interest, whether he was such initially or becomes such by valid assignment. The one who is to receive the income as the owner of the beneficial interest is to pay the tax. If under the law governing the trust the beneficial interest is assignable, and if it has been assigned without reservation, the assignee thus becomes the beneficiary and is entitled to rights and remedies accordingly. We find nothing in the revenue acts which denies him that status.\n  The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals turned upon the effect to be ascribed to the assignments. The court held that the petitioner had no interest in the corpus of the estate and could not dispose of the income until he received it. Hence it was said that 'the income was his' and his assignment was merely a direction to pay over to others what was due to himself. The question was considered to involve 'the date when the income became transferable.' 83 F.(2d) 655, at page 662. The \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 13]\n\u00a0\n Government refers to the terms of the assignment-that it was of the interest in the income 'which the said party of the first part now is, or may hereafter be, entitled to receive during his life from the trustees.' From this it is urged that the assignments 'dealt only with a right to receive the income' and that 'no attempt was made to assign any equitable right, title or interest in the trust itself.' This construction seems to us to be a strained one. We think it apparent that the conveyancer was not seeking to limit the assignment so as to make it anying less than a complete transfer of the specified interest of the petitioner as the life beneficiary of the trust, but that with ample caution he was using words to effect such a transfer. That the state court so construed the assignments appears from the final decree which described them as voluntary assignments of interests of the petitioner 'in said trust estate,' and it was in that aspect that petitioner's right to make the assignments was sustained.\n  The will creating the trust entitled the petitioner during his life to the net income of the property held in trust. He thus became the owner of an equitable interest in the corpus of the property. Brown v. Fletcher, \n235 \nU.S. 589, 598\n, 599, 157; Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 167\n, 168, 476; Senior v. Braden, \n295 \nU.S. 422, 432\n, 433, 803, 100 A.L.R. 794; Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 308 Ill. 519, 530, 139 N.E. 912. By virtue of that interest he was entitled to enforce the trust, to have a breach of trust enjoined and to obtain redress in case of breach. The interest was present property alienable like any other, in the absence of a valid restraint upon alienation. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Field (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 820, 822; Shanley v. Bowers (C.C.A.) 81 F.(2d) 13, 15. The beneficiary may thus transfer a part of his interest as well as the whole. See Restatement of the Law of Trusts,  130, 132 et seq. The assignment of the beneficial interest is not the assignment of a chose in action but of the 'right, title, and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 5\n, 14]\n\u00a0\n estate in and to property.' Brown v. Fletcher, supra; Senior v. Braden, supra. See Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, vol. 1,  183, pp. 516, 517; 17 Columbia Law Review, 269, 273, 289, 290.\n  We conclude that the assignments were valid, that the assignees thereby became the owners of the specified beneficial interests in the income, and that as to these interests they and not the petitioner were taxable for the tax years in question. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded with direction to affirm the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.\n  It is so ordered. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Acts of 1921,  219(a)(d), 42 Stat. 246; 1924 and 1926,  219(a) (b), 43 Stat. 275, 44 Stat. 32; 1928,  162(a)(b), 26 \nU.S.C.A.  162(a, b) and note. \n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOGARDUS v.

Whitney, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Homer S. Cummings, Attorney General, and Mr. A. F. Prescott, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a sum of money received by petitioner in January, 1931, was 'compensation' subject to the federal income tax, or a 'gift' exempt therefrom. The Commissioner held it to be compensation, constituting part of petitioner's gross income, and declared a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the determination of the Commissioner; and the court below, upon review, affirmed the order of the Board. 88 F.(2d) 646.\n The decisions of other courts of appeal upon the question under review are conflicting. Upon the one side, the First Circuit (Walker v. Commissioner, 88 F.(2d) 61, Judge Morton dissenting), the Fourth (Hall v. Commissioner, 89 F. (2d) 441), and the Fifth (Simpkinson v. Commissioner, 89 F.(2d) 397) lend definite support to the decision of the court below. Upon the other side, more or less definitely to the contrary, are to be found the decisions of the Third Circuit (Jones v. Commissioner, 31 F.(2d) 755; Cunningham v. Commissioner, 67 F.(2d) 205), the Sixth (Lunsford v. Commissioner, 62 F.(2d) 740), and the Ninth (Blair v. Rosseter, 33 F.(2d) 286). No useful purpose would be served by reviewing these decisions; and we pass to a consideration of the case before us. The facts follow:\n The amount ($10,000) received by petitioner was part of a distribution aggregating over $600,000 made by the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n Unopco Corporation at the instance of its stockholders to petitioner and others who had theretofore rendered service as employees or in some other capacity to the Universal Oil Products Company. The Universal company was a corporation organized in 1914. In the beginning, its only asset was an application for a patent for a process for refining petroleum and manufacturing gasoline. It thereafter acquired other patents, which it licensed to various producers on a royalty basis. Beginning in 1922, its business developed increasingly until by 1930 its royalties amounted to about $9,000,000. In January, 1931, its entire stock was sold to the United Gasoline Corporation for $25,000,000. Prior to the sale, and in contemplation of it, the Unopco Corporation had been organized for the purpose of acquiring, and it did acquire, certain assets of the Universal Company of the value of over $4,000,000. Up to the time of this acquisition, the Unopco Company had never engaged in any business activities, and thereafter its only business was the investment and management of the assets thus acquired.\n All of the former stockholders of the Universal Company became stockholders of the Unopco, with the same proportionate holdings. None of them, after the sale of the Universal stock, held any stock in the Universal, or in the United Gasoline Corporation. Under its new ownership, the Universal continued to carry on the same business, retaining a large part of its assets. A few days after the sale of the Universal Company's stock, the former stockholders, then stockholders of the Unopco, held a meeting at which it was proposed that they show their appreciation of the loyalty and support of some of the employees of the Universal Company by making them a 'gift or honorarium.' A resolution to that effect was adopted at a meeting of the board of directors of Unopco on \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n January 9, 1931, and by the stockholders the following day. By these resolutions, it was resolved that the sum of $607,500 be appropriated, paid, and distributed, as a bonus, to 64 former and present employees, attorneys and experts of Universal Oil Products Company, in recognition of the valuable and loyal services of said employees, attorneys, and experts to said Universal Oil Products Company. Payments ranged in amount from $ 100,000 to $500. Some of the recipients had been out of the employ of the Universal company for many years; and one of them was the sister of an employee killed in an explosion about the year 1919\n\n\n At the meeting of the former stockholders of Universal, the former president of that company, then president of the Unopco Corporation, said that they had reason to congratulate themselves on their great good fortune in the Universal Company, which started with nothing and had been built up in a phenomenal way; that they had profited largely; that during the years when they were struggling and moving forward they had had the loyal support of a number of employees, and he thought it would be a nice and generous thing to show their appreciation by remembering them in the form of a gift or honorarium. All of the stockholders acquiesced, with the result 'that it was understood that we would come forward and make these presents or gifts to the employees that were to be slated for it.' The matter had theretofore never been discussed among the old stockholders; and this was the first time it had been brought up for consideration. None of the recipients had ever been employed by Unopco or by any of the former stockholders of the Universal. The parties stipulated that neither the Universal Company nor the United 'was under any legal or other obligation to pay said employees ... any additional ... compensation' other than that which they were paid by the Universal \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n Company;1 and that neither Unopco nor any of its stockholders, nor any of the stockholders of Universal, was at any time under any legal or other obligation to pay any of said employees, attorneys, or experts, including petitioner, any salary, compensation, or consideration of any kind.\n It was further stipulated: 'Said payments were not made or intended to be made by said Unopco Corporation or any of its stockholders as payment or compensation for any services rendered or to be rendered or for any consideration given or to be given by any of said employees, attorneys or experts to said Unopco Corporation or to any of its stockholders.' None of the three corporations or their stockholders ever made or claimed any deduction for federal income tax purposes in respect of the payments made to the petitioner and the others. Payments were charged, in January, 1931, not to expense, but to surplus account on the books of the Unopco Company.\n The distribution was made to petitioner and the other employees, attorneys, and experts by checks, delivered either personally or by mail; and in each instance with the accompanying statement that the moneys represented by such checks were given at the instance of the stockholders of the Unopco Corporation as a gift and gratuity, and were, therefore, not subject to income tax on the part of the recipients.\n The Board of Tax Appeals concluded that, from a careful consideration of all the evidence, 'the payments made by Unopco to the petitioners and others were additional compensation in consideration of services rendered to Universal and were not tax-free gifts.' This, as we re- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n cently have pointed out, is 'a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact. It is to be distinguished from the findings of primary, evidentiary, or circumstantial facts. It is subject to judicial review and, on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of the Board.' Helvering v. Tex-Penn Oil Co., \n300 \nU.S. 481, 491\n, 57 S.Ct. 569, 573, 574; Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 732, 736. If the conclusion of the Board be regarded as a determination of a mixed question of law and fact, it has, as we shall presently show, no support in the primary and evidentiary facts. The ultimate determination, therefore, should be overturned, under the doctrine of Helvering v. Rankin, supra, as a matter of law.\n The statutory provisions involved are very plain and direct. Section 22(a) of the applicable revenue act (Revenue Act 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 797) provides that 'gross income,' among other things, includes 'compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid.' 26 U.S. C.A.  22(a) and note. Subdivision (b)(3), immediately following, provides that 'the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance' shall not be included in gross income, and shall be exempt from taxation under the income tax title.\n The court below (88 F.(2d) 646, 647) thought that payments such as are here involved 'may be at once 'gifts' under section 22, subdivision (b)( 3) 26 U.S.C.A.  22(b)(3) and note, and 'compensation for personal service' under subdivision (a).' Such a view of the statute is inadmissible and confusing. The statute definitely distinguishes between compensation on the one hand and gifts on the other hand; the former being taxable and the latter free from taxation. The two terms are, and were meant to be, mutually exclusive; and a bestowal of money cannot, under the statute, be both a gift and a payment of compensation. The court below went on to say that decisions like Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner Int. Rev., \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499, proved that payments could be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 40]\n\u00a0\n both gifts and compensation for personal services. The most casual reading of that case shows that it is authority for no such doctrine. There, an employer had paid the income tax assessed upon the salary of an employee. The employee had entered upon the discharge of his duties for the year in question under an express agreement to that effect. Quite evidently the payment, so agreed upon in advance, was in consideration of services to be rendered, and in no sense a gift. It was a part of the employee's compensation; and the court so held. The idea that it could be a gift in any sense was definitely rejected. We said (at page 730 of 279 U.S., 49 S. Ct. 499, 504): 'Nor can it be argued that the payment of the tax in No. 130 was a gift. The payment for services, even though entirely voluntary, was nevertheless compensation within the statute.'\n If the sum of money under consideration was a gift and not compensation, it is exempt from taxation and cannot be made taxable by resort to any form of subclassification. If it be in fact a gift, that is an end of the matter; and inquiry whether it is a gift of one sort or another is irrelevant. This is necessarily true, for since all gifts are made nontaxable, there can be no such thing under the statute as a taxable gift. A claim that it is a gift presents the sole and simple question whether its designation as such is genuine or fictitious; that is to say, whether, though called a gift, it is in reality compensation. To determine that question we turn to the facts, which we have already detailed.\n From these we learn that the recipients of the bounty here in question never were employees of the Unopco Company, or of any of its stockholders. The Universal Company, in whose employ some of the recipients then were, was at the time in no way connected with the Unopco Company or any of its stockholders. Some of the recipients had not been in the employ even of the Universal Company for many years, and one of them \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n never had been an employee. Neither the Universal Company nor any one else was under any obligation, legal or otherwise, to pay any of the recipients, including petitioner, any salary, compensation, or consideration of any kind. Such is the express stipulation of the parties. And most significant is the further stipulated fact that the disbursements were not made or intended to be made for any services rendered or to be rendered or for any consideration given or to be given by any of said employees, attorneys, or experts to said Unopco Corporation or to any of its stockholders. If the disbursements had been made by the Universal Company, or by stockholders of that company still interested in its success and in the maintenance of the good will and loyalty of its employees, there might be ground for the inference that they were payments of additional compensation. Compare Noel v. Parrott (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 669. But such an inference, even upon one of these suppositions, well might strain the realities in the light of the foregoing facts. However that may be, the disbursements here were authorized and the burden borne by persons who were then strangers to the Universal Company and its employees, under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to that company or to any of its present or former employees. There is entirely lacking the constraining force of any moral or legal duty as well as the incentive of anticipated benefit of any kind beyond the satisfaction which flows from the performance of a generous act. The intent is shown by the appeal made at the stockholders' meeting to the effect that it would be a nice and generous thing for these former stockholders of the Universal to show their appreciation of the past loyalty of that company's employees by remembering them in the form of a 'gift or honorarium,' and by the common understanding then reached that the stockholders would make the suggested 'presents or gifts' to these employees. Quite evidently, none of these stock \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 42]\n\u00a0\n holders had the slightest notion that a payment of compensation was to be made.\n In sum, then, the case comes to this: The stockholders of the Unopco, having at the time no connection with the Universal Company, but rejoicing in the fact of their own great good fortune, and mindful of the former loyal support of a number of employees of the Universal Company, and desiring to remember them 'in the form of a gift or honorarium,' resolved to make through the Unopco Company the distribution in question. In doing so, they were moved, as Judge Swan said in his dissenting opinion below, to an act of 'spontaneous generosity.' We agree with this dissenting opinion of Judge Swan, and the dissenting opinion of Judge Morton in Walker v. Commissioner, supra, as stating the correct view of the matter.\n The only facts which even seem to militate against this view are: (1) That the Unopco stockholders had benefited by the former services of the recipients; (2) that the stockholders at their meeting described the payment as a gift or 'honorarium'; and (3) that the resolutions authorized the payment as a 'bonus ... in recognition of the valuable and loyal services' of the employees, etc.\n\n 1. \nBecause the Unopco stockholders had benefited by the past services of the recipients, it by no means follows that the distribution in question was not a gratuity. It nowhere appears in the record that full compensation had not been made for these services. There would seem to be a natural inference to the contrary; and the inference is made determinate by the stipulated fact that no one was under any obligation, legal or otherwise (and this would include a moral obligation, however slight), 'to pay any additional compensation.' There is no ground for saying that the benefit received and the compensation then paid for it were not equivalents.\n\n 2. \nIt is said that the word 'honorarium' always denotes a compensatory payment. Without agreeing to this \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 43]\n\u00a0\n broad generalization, it is enough to say that the word is not here used by itself, but coupled with the word 'gift' in the phrase 'gift or honorarium.' Presumptively, the user of the phrase must have known that the word 'gift' did not include a compensatory payment, and it is hardly to be supposed that he would consciously nullify that word by the immediate use of another meaning the opposite. The phrase was used in an informal speech at the stockholders' meeting made by the president of the Unopco Company. The whole tone of the meeting indicates that the intention was to make gifts in recognition of, not payments for, former services. The conclusion in which the stockholders acquiesced was that they would come forward and make these 'presents or gifts' to the employees. In the light of all the circumstances, the absence of moral or other obligation and of any expectation of future benefit, it is reasonable to conclude that the word 'honorarium,' if the court below correctly defined it, was loosely and inaccurately used.\n\n 3. \nThe resolutions, which employ the word 'bonus,' were adopted to carry into effect the will of the stockholders expressed at their meeting. What occurred at that meeting, as we have already said, indicated their clear intention to make gifts. And since intention must govern, we must consider the word used in the light of the intention. A similar question was before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Levey v. Helvering, 62 App.D.C. 354, 68 F.(2d) 401. There, the corporate resolution characterized the payments to be made to reimburse certain officers for income taxes paid on salaries as 'gifts.' But the court held this characterization did not settle the matter. It reviewed the facts and reached the conclusion that in the light of them what was intended was not a gift but a bonus, and decided the case in accordance with that view. In other words, the thing that was decided upon and intended, in that case as in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 44]\n\u00a0\n this case, was misdescribed in the resolutions to carry the decision and intention into effect. In Rogers v. Hill, \n289 \nU.S. 582, 591\n, 592 S., 53 S.Ct. 731, 735, 88 A.L.R. 744, we held, following the dissenting opinion in the court below, that a bonus payment having no relation to the value of services for which it is given is in reality a gift in part. Certainly, where all, the facts and circumstances in the case, including the express stipulation of the parties, clearly show the making and the intent to make a gift, it cannot be converted into a payment for services by inaccurately describing it, in the consummating resolutions, as a bonus.\n Some stress is laid on the recital to the effect that the bounty is bestowed in recognition of past loyal services. But this recital amounts to nothing more than the acknowledgment of an historic fact as a reason for making the gifts. A gift is none the less a gift because inspired by gratitude for the past faithful service of the recipient. Compare Hobart's Adm'r v. Vail, 80 Vt. 152, 66 A. 820.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, Mr. Justice CARDOZO, and Mr. Justice BLACK (dissenting).\n A payment received as compensation for services is taxable as income, though made without consideration, and hence for many purposes a gift. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 730\n, 49 S.Ct. 499, 504. To hold, as the prevailing opinion seems to do, that every payment which in any aspect is a gift is perforce not compensation and hence relieved of any tax, is to work havoc with the law. A large body of decisions, whose provenance is Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, would be annulled by such a test. See e.g. Weagant v. Bowers (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 679; Fisher v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 59 F. (2d) 192; Bass v. Hawley (C.C.A .) 62 F.(2d) 721; United States v. McCormick (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 867; Botchford v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 81 F.(2d) \n\n[302 \nU.S. 34, 45]\n\u00a0\n 914, 110 A.L.R. 281; Schumacher v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 55 F.(2d) 1007. Cf. Lucas v. Ox Fibre Brush Co., \n281 \nU.S. 115\n, 50 S.Ct. 273. Their teaching makes it plain that the categories of 'gift' and 'compensation' are not always mutually exclusive, but at times can overlap. What controls is not the presence or absence of consideration. What controls is the intention with which payment, however voluntary, has been made. Has it been made with the intention that services rendered in the past shall be requited more completely, though full acquittance has been given? If so, it bears a tax. Has it been made to show good will, esteem, or kindliness toward persons who happen to have served, but who are paid without thought to make requital for the service? If so, it is exempt.\n We think there was a question of fact whether payment to this petitioner was made with one intention or the other. A finding either in his favor or against him would have had a fair basis in the evidence. It was for the triers of the facts to seek among competing aims or motives the ones that dominated conduct. Perhaps, if such a function had been ours, we would have drawn the inference favoring a gift. That is not enough. If there was opportunity for opposing inferences, the judgment of the Board controls.

CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE INS. CO.(1937)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 197]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leon P. Howell and Sterling D. Bennett, both of Beaumont, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., and Major T. Bell, of Beaumont, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a citizen and resident of Texas, brought this action against respondent, a Connecticut corporation, in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 198]\n\u00a0\n a Texas court to recover $4,000 with interest and attorney's fees. Respondent removed the case to the federal court for the Eastern District of Texas.\n The suit was to recover for permanent total disability under a policy of group insurance issued in Pennsylvania by respondent to the Gulf Oil Corporation. It covers employees of that corporation and its subsidiaries of which the Gulf Refining Company is one. Petitioner, an employee of that company, by that policy was insured in respect of life and disability. It provides that 'no claim for permanent total disability incurred by any employee during his period of employment shall be paid after the termination of such employment unless such employee gave written notice of such disability to the Company during the said period of employment or within 60 days thereafter.' That provision is conceded to be valid under Pennsylvania law. Petitioner failed to give the notice within the time specified. Article 5546, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, declares that no stipulation in a contract requiring notice as a condition precedent to the right to sue thereon shall be valid unless reasonable. 'Any such stipulation fixing the time within which such notice shall be given at a less period than ninety days shall be void.' The District Court held the Texas law controlling and refused to give effect to the quoted policy provision. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the Pennsylvania law applicable, the policy provision valid and that petitioner, having failed to give the required notice, was not entitled to recover. 84 F.(2d) 701. The sole question is whether the Pennsylvania law or the Texas law governs.\n In 1916 petitioner became an employee of the refining company and thereafter worked for it until October 8, 1932. During parts of that period he was insured by two group policies issued by defendant to the oil corporation. Both covered employees of the refining com- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 199]\n\u00a0\n pany. One, No. G5039, became effective in 1919; the employer paid the premiums; the employees contributed nothing to reimburse the employer or to procure the insurance or to keep the policies in force. The other, No. G5545, became effective in 1925; employees contributed part of the premiums thereon. Both terminated at the time of the taking effect, April 1, 1932, of the one, No. G5039R, under which petitioner brought this action.\n March 7, 1932, plaintiff made an application under the last-mentioned policy-then in contemplation-for the amount applicable on and after April 1, 1932, according to his salary classification and continuous service as provided in the policy. In his application he agreed to be bound by the rules governing the insurance, authorized his employer to deduct in advance the proper amount per month from his pay to cover a part of the premiums to be paid by the oil corporation to defendant on the policy to be issued, accepted cancellation of his insurance and released claims under the earlier policies and, in lieu of that protection, took the benefits granted by the new policy. The application was not addressed, made, or sent to defendant. It was delivered to, became, and remained a part of the permanent records of, the refining company.\n March 15, 1932, the oil corporation made written application, which was signed by it and delivered to defendant in Pennsylvania, for the policy of insurance and in the same instrument asked cancelation of the earlier policies. It requested that the policy be issued in Pennsylvania and that it be governed by the laws of that state. Final agreement between defendant and the oil corporation for execution and delivery of the policy was reached in Pennsylvania. On or about the same day defendant accepted the application; it signed the policy in Connecticut and issued and delivered it to the oil corporation in Pennsylvania. In that state the oil corporation paid the binding \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n premium required by the policy. None of the negotiations for the policy and no act done for its execution or delivery took place in Texas or in any state other than Pennsylvania and Connecticut.\n The policy also provides: It is issued for a term of one year in consideration of the application of the employer, the payment of a binding premium and of other premiums provided for. Each employee in service April 1, 1932, insured up to that date under policy G5545 becomes eligible on April 1, 1932. An employee may elect insurance under the policy by completing any form of pay roll deduction order approved by the employer. Each employee electing the insurance before becoming eligible will be insured automatically on the day he becomes eligible. On the effective date of the policy and on each annual renewal date an average annual premium rate will be established. The employer shall give the insurer notice of terminations of insurance and additions of employees becoming eligible. The changes shall be considered as having taken effect as if notice thereof had been given in advance. Upon termination of employment of any insured employee his insurance shall be canceled. 'The Company will issue to the Employer for each insured employee an individual certificate. This certificate will in no way void any of the terms and conditions outlined in the policy but will show the insurance protection to which the employee is entitled ... The policy and the application of the Employer ... and the applications of the employees, if any, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties ... This contract is issued and delivered ... in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is governed by the laws of that Commonwealth.'\n Defendant was not writing disability, life, or group insurance in Texas in 1918, 1925, or 1932, the years respectively in which it issued to the oil corporation the above \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 201]\n\u00a0\n mentioned policies, Nos. G5039, G5545, and G5039R. March 21, 1932, the Texas Board of Insurance Commissioners issued its certificate authorizing defendant to pursue the business of life, health and accident insurance within that state for the year ending February 28, 1933. But since 1917 defendant has not written any contracts of insurance nor has it had there any agent qualified so to do. It has no licensed agent, has not qualified to write insurance contracts in Texas or since 1917 accepted any application for insurance originating in that state. The evidence is that respondent 'has never written or delivered a contract or policy of insurance of any kind or character in the State of Texas.'\n On April 1, 1932, petitioner automatically became insured under the policy. The monthly premium for his insurance was $3; monthly deductions of $2.40 were made by the refining company and sent by it to the oil corporation at Pittsburgh. Defendant charged the premiums to the oil corporation and the latter paid them by check sent from Pittsburgh to defendant at Hartford.\n About May 1, 1932, respondent issued and delivered to the oil corporation an individual certificate stating that it was issued pursuant to the policy and that subject to its terms and conditions petitioner, John Boseman, an employee, was insured under Schedule B of the policy. The certificate contained the above-quoted policy provision requiring notice of disability. The oil corporation sent the certificate to petitioner's employer and July 20, 1932, the latter delivered it to petitioner in Texas. The defendant did not deal with the plaintiff or any of the employees of the refining company with reference to the insurance, certificates issued under the policy or premiums. All its dealings were with the oil corporation. Petitioner became totally disabled prior to termination of his employment which ended October 8, 1932. His insurance was canceled as of that date. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 202]\n\u00a0\n 1. The oil corporation and respondent intended, and the policy definitely declares, that Pennsylvania law should govern. Undoubtedly, as between employer and insurer, Pennsylvania law controls. \n1\n 'In every forum a contract is governed by the law with a view to which it was made.' \n2\n But the precise issue for decision is whether, as between petitioner and insurer, the policy provision requiring notice of claim is governed by Pennsylvania law or Texas law. Petitioner and other insured employees were not parties to, nor did they have any voice in, the negotiation or consummation of the contract. The terms of the policy were settled by the oil corporation and respondent. Eligible employees were given opportunity upon specified conditions to have insurance by giving payroll deduction orders approved by their employer. The policy did not of itself insure petitioner or any other person. It merely made available specified insurance to certain employees. For the payment of premiums the insurer looked only to the corporation. The latter, for the benefit of its insured employees, assumed the burden of paying to the insurer premiums to which they by the deduction orders had contributed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 203]\n\u00a0\n By his application petitioner accepted the provisions of the policy including the agreement of the oil corporation and respondent that the policy is governed by Pennsylvania law.\n\n 2. \nPetitioner insists that the delivery of the certificate in Texas made the law of that state, article 5546, applicable. But the certificate is not a part of the contract of, or necessary to, the insurance. \n4\n It is not included among the documents declared 'to constitute the entire contract of insurance.' Petitioner was insured on the taking effect of the policy long before the issue of the certificate. It did not affect any of the terms of the policy. It was issued to the end that the insured employee should have the insurer's statement of specified facts in respect of protection to which he had become entitled under the policy. It served merely as evidence of the insurance of the employee. Petitioner's rights and respondent's liability would have been the same if the policy had not provided for issue of the certificate. And, plainly, delivery of the certificate by the refining company to petitioner in Texas has no bearing upon the question whether Pennsylvania law or Texas law governs in respect of the notice of claim. We are unable to agree with decisions of the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas in cases similar to this that the certificate is a part of the contract of insurance or that its delivery \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 204]\n\u00a0\n is necessary to make the policy effective. \n5\n Nor are we required to follow their construction. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. \nIn support of his contention that Texas law applies petitioner suggests that the insurer, acting through the employer as its agent in that state, solicited and procured him to take insurance under the policy. There is no evidence that the insurer expressly authorized the oil corporation or any of its subsidiaries to act for it in consummating insurance under the policy. Petitioner's election and the employer's application for the policy were made before the Texas Board authorized the insurer to do business in that state. By uncontradicted evidence it is shown that the insurer did not qualify to solicit or write insurance or accept any application originating there. Employers regard group insurance not only as protection at low cost for their employees but also as advantageous to themselves in that it makes for loyalty, lessens turn-over and the like. \n7\n When procuring the policy, obtaining applications of employees, taking pay roll deduction orders, reporting changes in the insured group, paying premiums, and, generally, in doing whatever may serve to obtain and keep the insurance in force, employers act not as agents of the insurer, but \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 205]\n\u00a0\n for their employees or for themselves. \n8\n And wholly in accord with that view are the acts done in Texas that are claimed by petitioner to be attributable to the refining company or its agents. They are: The termination of the earlier policies; acceptance of petitioner's release of claims under them and his application under the new policy by the giving of pay roll deduction orders; delivery of the certificate to petitioner; the forwarding to the oil corporation of the amounts deducted from his pay on account of premiums. None of these was done for or on behalf of the insurer. The undisputed circumstantial facts require the conclusion that the employer acted, not as agent of the insurer, but for and on behalf of petitioner and other insured employees and in its own interest. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n 4. \nPetitioner cites articles 5054 and 5056, Revised Civil Statutes, as opposed to the lower court's ruling: 'If employes in Texas desire to join in an insurance plan about to be set up or already in operation in Pennsylvania, and either in person or through their employer take steps in Pennsylvania to do so, the laws of Texas do not control it.' Article 5054 applies only to contracts of insurance made by an insurance company doing business in Texas. \n10\n The respondent did no business in that state. \n11\n Article 5056 merely declares that one who in Texas does specified things in respect of insurance shall be held to be the agent of the insurance company for which the act is done or the risk taken 'as far as relates \n\n[301 \nU.S. 196, 206]\n\u00a0\n to all the liabilities, duties, requirements and penalties set forth in this chapter.' Clearly there is nothing in that article as expounded by the Supreme Court of Texas (Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Walker, 94 Tex. 473, 61 S.W. 711) that has any bearing on the question under consideration. The challenged ruling is sound and well supported by our decisions. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n 5. \nThe conclusion that Pennsylvania law governs the policy provision requiring notice of claim is supported not only by the making and delivery of the contract of insurance in that state, the declaration in the policy that Pennsylvania law shall govern and petitioner's acceptance of the insurance according to the terms of the policy, but also by the purpose of the parties to the contract that everywhere it shall have the same meaning and give the same protection, and that inequalities and confusion liable to result from applications of diverse state laws shall be avoided. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equitable Life Assurance Society v.

CHAPMAN(1937)\nNo. 534\nArgued: March 5, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of maine. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 184]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Asher Blum, of New York City, and Robert Hale, of Portland, Me., for appellant.\n Mr. Ralph W. Farris, of Augusta, Me., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Bourjois, Inc., a New York corporation, brought, in the federal court for Maine, this suit seeking to enjoin, both temporarily and permanently, the enforcement of chapter 109 of the Public Laws of Maine, 1935, entitled 'An Act for the Regulation of Cosmetics.' The bill was filed before January 1, 1936, the effective date of the Act. The Attorney General of Maine, the Commissioner of Health and Welfare, and the Director of Public Health were made defendants. The answers denied the material allegations of the bill. The case was heard before three judges; the application for a temporary injunction was denied, on the ground that plaintiff's objections were prematurely raised; and leave was granted to renew its \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n motion if in enforcing the Act interstate commerce should be interfered with or due process denied. Thereafter, a supplemental bill and answer were filed; the case was again heard; the court concluded that there was both federal and equitable jurisdiction; denied a motion for a temporary injunction; and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. The case is here on appeal.\n Section 1 of the Act provides: 'Registration of cosmetics. On and after January 1, 1936 no person, firm, corporation or copartnership shall hold for sale, sell, offer for sale, in intrastate commerce, give away, deal in, within this state, supply or apply in the conduct of a beauty shop, barber shop, hairdressing establishment or similar establishment, any cosmetic preparation unless the said preparation has been registered with and a certificate of registration secured from the department of health and welfare.'\n Section 2 declares that the purpose of the Act is to safeguard the public health; and provides for the issue of certificates of registration by the department of health and welfare 'to the manufacturer, proprietor, or producer of any cosmetic preparation.' Other sections of the Act contain elaborate provisions for the seizure and forfeiture of 'cosmetic preparations kept or deposited within the state intended for unlawful sale or use'; and for imposition of fines upon violators of the statute.\n The plaintiff manufactures cosmetics in New York; has no place of business in Maine; and does not hold, use, apply, or sell cosmetics within that State. Among its many customers are some whose places of business are in Maine; and their purchases are made in part on orders given in Maine to travelling salesman of the plaintiff. But no order so given is binding until approved by the plaintiff in New York. All shipments to Maine customers are made from New York; and the sales of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n cosmetics in Maine are not made in the original packages, the large containers in which the cosmetics are shipped from New York. Compare Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n, 33 S.Ct. 44; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 39 S.Ct. 125.\n The plaintiff has not applied for a certificate of registration of any of its preparations; and it announces that it will refuse to do so, because the statute is void under the Federal and State Constitutions. Sixteen distinct grounds of invalidity are urged with great earnestness. None is well founded. Only a few need to be discussed.\n First. Most prominent is the claim that the legislation violates the commerce clause. By its terms, the statute is limited in operation to intrastate commerce. It does not attempt to prohibit or regulate the introduction of cosmetics into the State. It is not directed to manufacturers. It applies only to persons who deal in cosmetics, or apply them, within the State; and the plaintiff does not do so. No doubt the plaintiff will lose its Maine customers unless its preparations may be sold there; and their sale will be prohibited within the State unless the preparations are registered. But the State does not demand that the application for registration be made by the manufacturer or proprietor of the preparation. The defendants who administer the statute have construed it as permitting any one interested to make the application. As some cosmetics may be of a character to injure the health of the users, the State may prohibit the sale in intrastate commerce of a preparation unless it has been found, upon on due enquiry, to be harmless. The fact that plaintiff's products are made in New York does not confer immunity from such regulation in Maine. Compare Mutual Film Corporation v. Hodges, \n236 \nU.S. 248, 258\n, 35 S.Ct. 393; Armour & co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S.Ct. 440, Ann.Cas.1916D, 548; Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 184\n, 56 S.Ct. 159, 162, 101 A.L.R. 853. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n There is no discrimination against interstate commerce, since the regulation applies equally to all preparations, whether manufactured within or without the State of Maine.\n Second. The plaintiff contends that its interstate commerce is directly burdened, because registration, which is indispensable to the maintenance of its trade in Maine, involves payment of a fee; that only an inspection fee can be justified; and that the State has failed to show that the fee charged is not in excess of the cost of inspection. Section 2 of the statute fixes the initial fee at 50 cents per preparation, with a similar annual renewal fee; and stipulates that: 'Fees received under the provisions of this act shall be used by said department for carrying out the purposes of this act.'\n Even if it had been necessary, under the rules applied in Foote & Co., Inc., v. Stanley, \n232 \nU.S. 494\n, 34 S.Ct. 377, and Great Northern Ry. Co. v. State of Washington, \n300 \nU.S. 154\n, 57 S.Ct. 397, for the State to establish that the fees here charged are not excessive, the State must be deemed to have sustained that burden. The fact that the fee for registration is only 50 cents suggests that it may prove inadequate rather than excessive. The case was heard shortly after the statute became operative. It was obviously impossible then to determine whether the fees would prove to be in excess of the administrative requirement, and in this situation it is sufficient if it is shown that the charges are not unreasonable on their face. As was said in Patapsco Guano Co. v. North Carolina Board of Agriculture, \n171 \nU.S. 345, 354\n, 18 S.Ct. 862, 865, 'If the receipts are found to average largely more than enough to pay the expenses, the presumption would be that the legislature would moderate the charge.' See Red 'C' Oil Manufacturing Co. v. Board of Agriculture of North Carolina, \n222 \nU.S. 380, 393\n, 32 S.Ct. 152. Here, the statute operates directly only upon intrastate commerce. Where interstate commerce is only indirectly affected, it rests upon one challenging the legislation to show actual \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n undue burden upon such commerce. See Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Tax Commission of Washington, \n297 \nU.S. 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 522, 105 A.L.R. 1. The mere fact that the fees imposed might exceed the cost of inspection is immaterial. See General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211, 231\n, 28 S.Ct. 475; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 476 S., 42 S.Ct. 375, 378.\n The Maine statute presents no question under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment such as was dealt with in Great Northern Ry. Co. v. State of Washington, \n300 \nU.S. 154\n, 57 S.Ct. 397. The statute provides that the fees collected shall be devoted solely to the enforcement of this Act; and the Act directly regulates but one class of activity. The record shows that the State Treasurer has set up a separate account to which all cosmetic fees are credited, and against which are to be charged only the expense of enforcement. Compare Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 189\n, 20 S.Ct. 633; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann.Cas. 1917D, 642; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 479\n, 42 S.Ct. 375, 379.\n Third. The plaintiff contends that in other respects the statute violates rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and the Constitution of the State. It objects that the power conferred upon the board to grant or deny a certificate is unlimited; that the board has issued no regulations; and that neither the statute nor the board has provided for hearing an applicant. The plaintiff has not applied for a certificate; and it is not to be assumed that, if he concludes to do so, his application will be refused, or that the board will deny any right to which he is entitled. See Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 20 S.Ct. 633; Lehon v. City of Atlanta, \n242 \nU.S. 53, 56\n, 37 S.Ct. 70; Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, 585; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, \n300 \nU.S. 608\n, 57 S.Ct. 549, decided March 29, 1937.1 There are also other answers to this con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n tention. Section 2 defines the department's control of registration: 'The said department is authorized to regulate or to refuse the issuance of certificates of registration or to prohibit the sale of cosmetic preparations which in its judgment contain injurious substances in such amounts as to be poisonous, injurious or detrimental to the person.' Delegation of the power to exercise that judgment is not obnoxious to the Constitution of Maine. Compare Bangor Railway & Electric Co. v. Orono, 109 Me. 292, 296, 84 A. 385; In re Knox County Electric Co., 119 Me. 179, 182, 109 A. 898; McKenney v. Farnsworth, 121 Me. 450, 452-454, 118 A. 237. And obviously, it contravenes no provision of the Federal Constitution. Compare United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 517\n, 31 S.Ct. 480; Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio, \n236 \nU.S. 230, 246\n, 35 S.Ct. 387, Ann.Cas.1916C, 296; Hall v. Geiger- Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539, 554\n, 37 S.Ct. 217, L.R.A.1917F, 514, Ann.Cas.1917C, 643; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, \n300 \nU.S. 608\n, 57 S.Ct. 549, decided March 29, 1937. Neither constitution requires that exercise of such a power be preceded by the adoption of regulations. And neither constitution requires that there must be a hearing of the applicant before the board may exercise a judgment under the circumstances and of the character here involved. The requirement of due process of law is amply safeguarded by Section 2 of the statute, which provides: 'From the refusal of said department to issue a certificate of registration for any cosmetic preparation appeal shall lie to the superior court in the county of Kennebec or any other county in the state from which the same was offered for registration.'

Plaintiff urges that relief should be granted because the provisions of the statute concerning seizure and forfeiture of unregistered cosmetics violate the Constitution of Maine. To that claim it is a sufficient answer that if there is a wrongful seizure, it will be of goods belonging to others. For, as the bill and findings reveal, no goods of the plaintiff will ever be liable to seizure, since the plaintiff will have none in Maine. If under this statute the constitutional rights of others are violated by an unlawful seizure and forfeiture, they, and not the plaintiff, must seek the redress. Compare Tyler v.

Van Veen and Arthur Garfield Hays, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. W.  Northcutt and E. Harold Sheats, both of Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A Georgia statute provides that there shall be levied and collected each year from every inhabitant of the state between the ages of 21 and 60 a poll tax of one dollar, but that the tax shall not be demanded from the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n blind or from females who do not register for voting. Georgia Code, 1933,  92-108. The State Constitution declares that to entitle a person to register and vote at any election he shall have paid all poll taxes that he may have had opportunity to pay agreeably to law. Article 2,  1, par. 3, Code,  2-603. The form of oath prescribed to qualify an elector contains a clause declaring compliance with that requirement. Section 34- 103. Tax collectors may not allow any person to register for voting unless satisfied that his poll taxes have been paid. Section 34-114. Appellant brought this suit in the superior court of Fulton county to have the clause of the Constitution and the statutory provisions above mentioned declared repugnant to various provisions of the Federal Constitution and to compel appellee to allow him to register for voting without payment of poll taxes. The court dismissed his petition. The state Supreme Court affirmed. 183 Ga. 189, 188 S.E. 140.\n The pertinent facts alleged in the petition are these. March 16, 1936, appellant, a white male citizen 28 years old, applied to appellee to register him for voting for federal and state officers at primary and general elections. He informed appellee he had neither made poll tax returns nor paid any poll taxes and had not registered to vote because a receipt for poll taxes and an oath that he had paid them are prerequisites to registration. He demanded that appellee administer the oath, omitting the part declaring payment of poll taxes, and allow him to register. Appellee refused.\n Appellant maintains that the provisions in question are repugnant to the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amemdmemt and to the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nHe asserts that the law offends the rule of equality in that it extends only to persons between the ages of 21 and 60 and to women only if they register for voting \n\n[302 \nU.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n and in this it makes payment a prerequisite to registration. He does not suggest that exemption of the blind is unreasonable.\n Levy by the poll has long been a familiar form of taxation, much used in some countries and to a considerable extent here, at first in the colonies and later in the states. To prevent burdens deemed grievous and oppressive, the Constitutions of some states prohibit or limit poll taxes. That of Georgia prevents more than a dollar a year. Article 7,  2, par. 3, Code,  2-5004. Poll taxes are laid upon persons without regard to their occupations or property to raise money for the support of government or some more specific end. \n1\n The equal protection clause does not require absolute equality. While possible by statutory declaration to levy a poll tax upon every inhabitant of whatsoever sex, age or condition, collection from all would be impossible for always there are many too poor to pay. Attempt equally to enforce such a measure would justify condemnation of the tax as harsh and unjust. See Faribault v. Misener, 20 Minn. 396, 398 ( Gil. 347); Thurston County v. Tenino Stone Quarries, 44 Wash. 351, 355, 87 P. 634, 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 306, 12 Ann.Cas. 314; Salt Lake City v. Wilson, 46 Utah 60, 66 et seq., 148 P. 1104. Collection from minors would be to put the burden upon their fathers or others upon whom they depend for support. 2 It is not unreasonable to exclude them from the class taxed.\n Men who have attained the age of 60 are often, if not always, excused from road work, jury duty and service \n\n[302 \nU.S. 277, 282]\n\u00a0\n in the militia. \n3\n They have served or have been liable to be called on to serve the public to the extent that the state chooses to require. So far as concerns equality under the equal protection clause, there is no substantial difference between these exemptions and exemption from poll taxes. The burden laid upon appellant is precisely that put upon other men. The rate is a dollar a year, commencing at 21 and ending at 60 years of age.\n The tax being upon persons, women may be exempted on the basis of special considerations to which they are naturally entitled. In view of burdens necessarily borne by them for the preservation of the race, the state reasonably may exempt them from poll taxes. Cf. Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412\n, 421, et seq., 28 S.Ct. 324, 13 Ann.Cas. 957; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671\n, 34 S.Ct. 469; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, L.R.A.1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 \nU.S. 385\n, 35 S.Ct. 345. The laws of Georgia declare the husband to be the head of the family and the wife to be subject to him. Section 53-501. To subject her to the levy would be to add to his burden. Moreover, Georgia poll taxes are laid to raise money for educational purposes, and it is the father's duty to provide for education of the children. Section 74-105. Discrimination in favor of all women being permissible, appellant may not complain because the tax is laid only upon some or object to registration of women without payment of taxes for previous years. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174, 176; Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 270\n, 33 S.Ct. 27, Ann.Cas.1914B, 71.\n Payment as a prerequisite is not required for the purpose of denying or abridging the privilege of voting. It does not limit the tax to electors; aliens are not there permitted to vote, but the tax is laid upon them, if within \n\n[302 \nU.S. 277, 283]\n\u00a0\n the defined class. It is not laid upom persons 60 or more years old, whether electors or not. Exaction of payment before registration undoubtedly serves to aid collection from electors desiring to vote, but that use of the state's power is not prevented by the Federal Constitution. Cf. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 44\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, 601\n\n\n 2. To make payment of poll taxes a prerequisite of voting is not to deny any privilege or immunity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Privilege of voting is not derived from the United States, but is conferred by the state and, save as restrained by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution, the state may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 170 et seq.; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 664\n, 665 S., 4 S.Ct. 152; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 37\n, 38 S., 13 S.Ct. 3; Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 362\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, L.R.A.1916A, 1124. The privileges and immunities protected are only those that arise from theConstitution and laws of the United States and not those that spring from other sources. Hamilton v. Regents of University of California, \n293 \nU.S. 245, 261\n, 55 S.Ct. 197, 203.\n\n 3. \nThe Nineteenth Amendment, adopted in 1920, declares: 'The right of citizens of he United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.' It applies to men and women alike and by its own force supersedes inconsistent measures, whether federal or state. Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130, 135\n, 42 S.Ct. 217. Its purpose is not to regulate the levy or collection of taxes. The construction for which appellant contends would make the amendment a limitation upon the power to tax. Cf. Minor v. Happersett, supra, 21 Wall. 162, 173; Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., \n271 \nU.S. 170, 173\n, 174 S., 46 S.Ct. 449, 450. The payment of poll taxes as a prerequisite to voting is a familiar and reasonable regulation long enforced in many states and for fore than a century in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 277, 284]\n\u00a0\n Georgia. \n4\n That measure reasonably may be deemed essential to that form of levy. Imposition without enforcement would be futile. Power to levy and power to collect are equally necessary. And, by the exaction of payment before registration, the right to vote is neither denied nor abridged on account of sex. It is fanciful to suggest that the Georgia law is a mere disguise under which to deny or abridge the right of men to vote on account of their sex. The challenged enactment is not repugnant to the Nineteenth Amendment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Dowell, History of Taxation and Taxes in England, vol.

O'KEEFE(1937)\nNo. 575\nArgued: March 8, 1937Decided: March 29, 1937\n\n\n [ Brown v. O'Keefe   \n300 \nU.S. 598\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 599]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. Wm. Elmer Brown, Jr., of Atlantic City, N.J., for petitioner.\n  Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In a suit for the enforcement of the personal liability imposed by the statute then in force upon shareholders in national banks, petitioner, the defendant in the suit, disclaimed liability, first, upon the ground that before the assessment of the shareholders his ownership of the shares was divested by the filing of a bankruptcy petition and the appointment of a trustee thereunder, and, second, upon the ground that, if ownership continued, liability was extinguished by virtue of a discharge in bankruptcy. Whether the defense should have prevailed is now to be determined.\n  Petitioner was adjudicated a bankrupt on April 21, 1933, and on July 31, 1933, was granted a discharge. At the filing of the bankruptcy petition he was the owner of ten shares of stock of the Union National Bank of Atlantic City, N.J. Since September 30, 1931, the Union Bank had been in course of voluntary liquidation (under \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 600]\n\u00a0\n Rev.St.  5220 and 5221, 12 \nU.S.C.  181, 182 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  181, 182)), the Atlantic City National Bank being the liquidating agent. The terms of liquidation are defined by an agreement. Union sold to Atlantic all its assets of every kind for $1,686,977.63, which the buyer was to pay through an assumption of the seller's liabilities. The seller covenanted that the assets had a value equal to the price, and bound itself to pay the deficiency, if any should ensue. To this there was to be an exception in the case of the banking house and fixtures, which were to be taken at a valuation of $353,000, irrespective of the outcome. The amount of the seller's liability was to be fixed at the expiration of two years (i.e., on September 30, 1933), at which time all notes then uncollected were to be reckoned as lossess. Before that time arrived, the liquidating bank met with troubles of its own. In January, 1933, it was declared to be insolvent by the Comptroller of the Currency, and a receiver was appointed to wind up its affairs. In December, 1933, Union also was declared insolvent, and the receiver then appointed is the respondent in this court. Valuing the uncollected assets, the Comptroller found it necessary to enforce the personal liability laid upon the shareholders (Rev.St.  5151, as amended, 12 \nU.S.C.  63 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  63); 38 Stat. 273, 12 \nU.S.C.  64 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  64)), and by an order made and filed on January 8, 1934, assessed them to the amount of the par value of the shares. The receiver has sued the petitioner as one of the shareholders of Union to recover that assessment.\n  In defense of the suit petitioner asserts, as we have seen, that the ownership of the stock was divested by the bankruptcy, and also that liability was barred, if ownership remained. To estimate correctly the worth of these defenses we must have some other facts before us. The record shows that on October 27, 1933, by order of a referee, the trustee in bankruptcy was 'authorized and di- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 601]\n\u00a0\n rected to abandon all title to and to disclaim all the interest of the bankrupt in' the ten shares of Union National Bank, now the subject of this suit. There is no suggestion that in the interval between adjudication and disclaimer the trustee had done anything betokening acceptance. The record also shows, in the form of an affidavit accepted by the court, that the bankrupt in his list of liabilities included the liability to assessment on his shares of Union stock, and that in his schedule of creditors he included Union and Atlantic as well as the receiver for Atlantic, then in charge of its affairs. The same affidavit tells us that promptly upon the transfer of the assets in September, 1931, the liabilities assumed by Atlantic were paid to the last dollar; that at the time of the defendant's bankruptcy Union had no debts or liabilities except the debt or liability to the liquidating agent; and that even before the bankruptcy the fact had been definitely ascertained that the liquidation of the Union assets would result in a deficiency which would require an assessment of the stockholders up to the maximum amount of the par value of the shares. \n1\n The estimate was not impracticable, for about a year and seven months had passed since liqui- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 602]\n\u00a0\n dation had begun, and only about five months were left before it would be deemed to be complete.\n  Upon these facts, established by the pleadings and supporting affidavits, the receiver moved for judgment. The District Court held the defenses insufficient, and gave judgment against the defendant for the amount of the assessment. Slaughter v. Brown, 16 F.Supp. 494. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where the judgment was affirmed. 85 F. (2d) 885. An important question of bankruptcy law being involved, a writ of certiorari issued from this court. \n299 \nU.S. 539\n.\n  We dismiss with a few words the petitioner's contention that at the moment of the bankruptcy he lost the title to the shares, and became relieved thereby of the liabilities attendant upon ownership, though his name was left continuously on the stock book of the bank. Cf. Richmond v. Irons, \n121 \nU.S. 27, 58\n; Matteson v. Dent, \n176 \nU.S. 521\n. Whatever title or inchoate interest may have passed to the trustee was extinguished by relation as of the filing of the petition when the trustee informed the court that the shares were burdensome assets, and was directed by the court to abandon and disclaim them. American File Co. v. Garrett, \n110 \nU.S. 288, 295\n; Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 \nU.S. 1, 13\n; Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 39\n; Dushane v. Beall, \n161 \nU.S. 513\n; First National Bank v. Lasater, \n196 \nU.S. 115\n. In such case 'the title stands as if no assignment had been made.' Sessions v. Romadka, supra, \n145 \nU.S. 29\n, at page 52, 805. Cf. Mills Novelty Co. v. Monarch Tool & Mfg. Co.

A precise analogy is found in the law of gifts and legacies. Acceptance is presumed, but rejection leaves the title by relation as if the gift had not been made. See Albany Hospital v. Albany Guardian Society, 214 N.Y. 435, 441, 442, 108 N.E. 812, Ann.Cas.1916D, 1195, collecting many cases. For the purposes of the case at hand the result will \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 603]\n\u00a0\n be the same whether title is conceived of as remaining in the bankrupt or as afterwards reverting. Albany Hospital v. Albany Guardian Society, supra, 214 N.Y. 435, at pages 443, 445, 108 N.E. 812, Ann.Cas.1916D, 1195. In either view it is his after disclaimer by the trustee, wherever it may have been while acceptance was uncertain. American File Co. v. Garrett, supra.\n  The petitioner being held to be the owner of the shares, we pass to the closer question whether the effect of the discharge in bankruptcy was to extinguish the personal liability that was attached to his ownership as a statutory incident.\n  Liabilities are not discharged in bankruptcy unless claims thereon exist in favor of claimants whose identity is determinable at the date of the petition. Zavelo v. Reeves, \n227 \nU.S. 625, 631\n, Everett v. Judson, \n228 \nU.S. 474, 479\n, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 154. If the Union Bank at that date had been a going concern, the possibility that it might later become insolvent or resort to liquidation would not have furnished an occasion for stripping the shares of their statutory incidents by the device of a discharge in bankruptcy. In such a situation there would be no claim to be proved and no one capable of proving it. But at the date of this petition the Union Bank was not a going concern with the liability of shareholders a latent possibility. It was in course of liquidation by a voluntary liquidator. Not only was it in liquidation, but according to the evidence it was already known to be insolvent. Liquidation coupled with insolvency is the critical event which is capable of transforming a potential liability into one presently enforceable, as soon as a qualified claimant appears upon the scene. The method of winding up determines who the spokesman for the claim shall be. If a bank is in course of liquidation by the Comptroller of the Currency, the personal liability of stockholders is enforceable upon the direction of the Comptroller, at the suit of a receiver. Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156,  1, 19 Stat. 63; 12 U.S.C.  191 (12 U.S.C.A.  191). Cf. 12 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 604]\n\u00a0\n U.S.C.  63, 64 (12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64). If the bank is in course of liquidation by a voluntary liquidator, the liability is enforceable by a creditor or creditors, suing for themselves and for others similarly situated. Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156,  2, 19 Stat. 63, 12 U.S.C.  65 ( 12 U.S.C.A.  65). Cf. 12 U.S.C.  181 (12 U.S.C.A.  181). We have no occasion to inquire whether in the absence of an assessment by the Comptroller of the Currency the statutory liability may be enforced by a receiver through the medium of a claim in bankruptcy. Cf. Erickson v. Richardson (C.C.A.) 86 F.(2d) 963. That question is not here. An assessment by the Comptroller, even if a necessary preliminary to a suit by a receiver when a bank is in the course of involuntary liquidation, is not a condition precedent, in cases of voluntary liquidation, to proceedings in behalf of creditors. No adequate reason occurs to us, and none, we think, is stated in the arguments of counsel, why a court of bankruptcy is then incompetent to liquidate the amount of the indebtedness effectively and speedily, and give relief accordingly. Cf. Cunningham v. Commissioner of Banks, 249 Mass. 401, 426, 144 N.E. 447; United States v. Illinois Surety Co. (C.C.A.) 226 F. 653, 662, 663.\n  In saying this we are not unmindful that a comprehensive suit in equity is commonly the proper remedy against shareholders where insolvency becomes manifest in voluntary liquidation. 12 U.S.C.  65 (12 U.S.C.A.  65). The remedy does not exclude the presentation of a proof of claim in bankruptcy, the amount to be liquidated under the direction of the court by bill in equity or otherwise. Cunningham v. Commissioner of Banks, supra; United States v. Illinois Surety Co., supra; King v. Pomeroy (C.C.A.) 121 F. 287; Irons v. Manufacturers' Nat. Bank (C.C.) 17 F. 308, 314; Id. (C.C.) 27 F. 591. Cf. Hightower v. American Nat. Bank. \n263 \nU.S. 351\n; Wyman v. Wallace, \n201 \nU.S. 230\n. By the mandate of the statute (Bankruptcy Act  63b, 11 U.S.C.  103(b), 11 U.S.C.A.  103(b): 'Unliquidated claims against the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 605]\n\u00a0\n bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved and allowed against the estate.' The result is to invest the court with a discretionary power that can be fitted to the needs of varying situations. Maynard v. Elliott, \n283 \nU.S. 273\n; Cf. Foust v. Munson S.S. Lines, \n299 \nU.S. 77, 83\n, 93. A holding that a creditor is disabled from making proof in bankruptcy till a suit in equity against the shareholders has been brought to a decree would have unfortunate results. Today it is the bankrupt who is asserting the provable quality of such a claim in order to preserve for himself the benefit of a discharge. Tomorrow it may be a creditor who unless he is given that opportunity may lose his dividend from the assets and find his suit in equity illusory. In that predicament the malleable processes of courts of bankruptcy give assurance of a remedy that can be moulded and adapted to the needs of the occasion. Cunningham v. Commissioner of Banks, supra.\n  Liquidation being possible, the claim is not defeated though there was uncertainty as to its amount at the filing of the petition. Maynard v. Elliott, supra. Yet even the amount was certain, if we are to credit the defendant's statement. By this it appears that long before the bankruptcy the necessity for an assessment to the amount of the par value of the shares had become obvious to the liquidating agent and indeed to all concerned. The facts are far removed from those in Miller v. Irving Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 256\n, where the claim had its origin in the covenants of a lease. For historical causes such covenants are sui generis (Manhattan Properties v. Irving Trust Co., \n291 \nU.S. 320\n; Gardiner v. Butler & Co., \n245 \nU.S. 603, 38\n S. Ct. 214), but the analogy is still imperfect if that distinction be ignored. There the only cause of action belonging to the claimant was for a deficiency that was \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 606]\n\u00a0\n dependent upon unpredictable events. \n2\n Here the progress of the liquidation had already brought about a deficiency too great to be corrected by any unexpected windfall. This at least is the situation as the petitioner describes it. What infusion of contingency will vitiate a claim is at best a question of degree (Maynard v. Elliott, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 273\n, at page 278, 392), though there is a leaning toward allowance in aid of the purpose of the statute to relieve the honest debtor (Williams v. U.S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 549, 554\n, 555; Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Ass'n, \n240 \nU.S. 581, 591\n, L.R.A.1917B, 580). To all this we add that the uncertainty, if there was any, as to the exact amount of the assessment was to be dispelled at the farthest by September 30, 1933, less than six months later, for obligations then unpaid were to be classified as losses. Cf. Bankruptcy Act,  57n, as amended May 27, 1926, 11 U.S.C.  93n (11 U.S.C.A.  93(n). Upon the facts of this case the impediments to a prompt ascertainment of the liability of shareholders were unsubstantial, if not imaginary.\n  Other objections are made to the operation of the discharge, but they need not detain us long.\n  There is argument that a claim against a stockholder is not provable in bankruptcy for the reason that it is founded on a statutory liability not subject to discharge. Bankruptcy Act  63, as amended, 11 U.S.C.  103, 11 U.S.C.A.  103. True indeed it is that the liability is created by a statute, and not solely by agreement. McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 \nU.S. 154, 159\n, 161, 3 Ann.Cas. 500; Christopher v. Norvell, \n201 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 226, 5 Ann.Cas. 740. No disclaimer by the stockholder would be effective to avoid it. Even so the liability, created though it is by statute, is quasi contractual in its origin and basis. Chisholm v. Gilmer, \n299 \nU.S. 99, 102\n, 66; Shriver v. Woodbine Sav. Bank, 285 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 598\n, 607]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 467, 477, 433; Coffin Brothers & Co. v. Bennett, \n277 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 423; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n; Christopher v. Norvell, supra; McClaine v. Rankin, supra, \n197 \nU.S. 154\n, at page 159, 25 S. Ct. 410, 3 Ann.Cas. 500; McDonald v. Thompson, \n184 \nU.S. 71, 74\n. Cf. Erickson v. Richardson, supra. It is an incident affixed by law to the contract of membership between shareholder and bank. Id. A liability upon quasi contract is one upon an 'implied contract,' and so provable in bankruptcy (Bankruptcy Act  63a(4), as amended, 11 U.S.C.  103(a)(4), 11 U.S.C.A.  103(a)(4); Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176\n; Tindle v. Birkett, \n205 \nU.S. 183, 184\n; Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 152), if the other conditions of allowance are found to be fulfilled.\n  Finally argument is possible that the discharge is ineffective against the creditors of the bank for the reason that only a single creditor of Union was listed in the schedules. This, however, is unimportant if the creditor so listed (the liquidating agent) was in fact the only creditor, as the petitioner insists it was. Cf. Longfield v. Minnesota Savings Bank, 95 Minn. 54, 103 N.W. 706. If in fact there were other creditors whose names have been omitted, the burden rests on the respondent to make proof of such omission. Hill v. Smith, \n260 \nU.S. 592, 595\n, 220. The conclusion may well follow if the omission shall be proved, that as to any creditors not listed the discharge is without effect.\n  Whether the petitioner will be able to make good the allegations of his answer, amplified and explained by the supporting affidavits, is not to be predicted now. Enough for present purposes that there are issues to be tried.\n  The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accord with this opinion. Ordered accordingly.\n  Reversed and remanded. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'At the time that I was adjudicated a bankrupt as aforesaid it had been determined and from then until now it has been definitely determined and known that said Union National Bank was insolvent.

The answer depends upon whether the water system of the city was created and is conducted in the exercise of the city's governmental functions. If so, its operations are immune from federal taxation and, as a necessary corollary, 'fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.' People of State of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401, 57\n S. Ct. 269, 272 (January 4, 1937).\n  Petitioners holds his office as chief engineer by statutory authority, with a fixed annual salary of $14,000. He exercises supervision over the engineering details connected with the supplying of water for public purposes and for consumption by the inhabitants of the city; supervises the protection of the water supply from pollution; and generally exercises control over the operation of the water system, its personnel, expenditure of money, and other matters relating thereto.\n  In the early history of the city, water was furnished by private companies; but a century or more ago, the city itself began to take over the development and distribution. In 1831, the board of aldermen declared its dissatisfaction with the private control, and resolved that the powers then vested in private hands should be repealed by the Legislature and vested exclusively in the corporation of the city of New York. This, in effect, was initiated in 1833 (Laws 1833, c. 36); and, soon thereafter, the city constructed municipal waterworks, and, with slight exceptions, private control and operation ceased. The sources of water supply furnished by such companies as remain is approaching exhaustion, and the water furnished is of a quality inferior to that supplied by the municipality. From 1833 to the present time, additions to the water supply and system have been steadily made until the cost has mounted to more than $ 500,000,000; and it is estimated that additional expenditures of a quarter of a billion dollars will be necessary. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 361]\n\u00a0\n The cost of bringing water from the Catskills alone amounted to approximately $200,000,000. The municipal outstanding bonded indebtedness incurred for supplying the city with water amounts to an enormous sum. More than half the entire population of the state is found within the municipal boundaries. The action of the city from the beginning has been taken under legislative authority.\n  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue having assessed a deficiency tax against petitioner in respect of his salary, petitioner sought a redetermination at the hands of the Board of Tax Appeals. That board sustained the commissioner and decreed a deficiency against petitioner of $ 256.27 for the year 1931. Upon review, the court below affirmed the decree of the board. (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 32. While the sum involved is small, we granted the writ of certiorari because of the obvious importance of the question involved. \n299 \nU.S. 536\n.\n  The phrase 'governmental functions,' as it here is used, has been qualified by this court in a variety of ways. Thus, in South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 461\n, 4 Ann.Cas. 737, it was suggested that the exemption of state agencies and instrumentalities from federal taxation was limited to those which were of a strictly governmental character, and did not extend to those used by the state in carrying on an ordinary private business. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 172\n, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312, the immunity from taxation was related to the essential governmental functions of the state. In Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214, 225\n, 173, we said that the state 'cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend.' And immunity is not established because the state has the power to engage \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 362]\n\u00a0\n in the business for what the state conceives to be the public benefit. Id. In United States v. People of State of California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 185\n, 56 S. Ct. 421, 424, the suggested limit of the federal taxing power was in respect of activities in which the states have traditionally engaged.\n  In the present case, upon the one side, stress is put upon the adjective 'essential,' as used in the Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. Case, while, on the other side, it is contended that this qualifying adjective must be put aside in favor of what is thought to be the greater reach of the word 'usual,' as employed in the Powers Case. But these differences in phraseology, and the others just referred to, must not be too literally contradistinguished. In neither of the cases cited was the adjective used as an exclusive or rigid delimitation. For present purposes, however, we shall inquire whether the activity here in question constitutes an essential governmental function within the proper meaning of that term; and in that view decide the case.\n  There probably is no topic of the law in respect of which the decisions of the state courts are in greater conflict and confusion than that which deals with the differentiation between the governmental and corporate powers of municipal corporations. This condition of conflict and confusion is confined in the main to decisions relating to liability in tort for the negligence of officers and agents of the municipality. In that field, no definite rule can be extracted from the decisions. \n1\n It is true that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 363]\n\u00a0\n in most of the state courts, including those in the state of New York, it is held that the operation of waterworks falls within the category of corporate activities; and the city's liability is affirmed in tort actions arising from negligence in such operation. But the rule in respect of such cases, as we pointed out in Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 \nU.S. 182, 192\n, 43 S. Ct. 534, 538, 29 A.L.R. 1471, has been 'applied to escape difficulties, in order that injustice may not result from the recognition of technical defenses based upon the governmental character of such corporations'; and the rule is hopelessly indefinite, probably for that very reason.\n  This is not, however, an action for personal injuries sounding in tort, but a proceeding which seeks in effect to determine whether immunity from federal taxation, in respect of the activity in question, attaches in favor of a state-created municipality-an objective so different in character from that sought in a tort action as to suggest caution in applying as the guide to a decision of the former a local rule of law judicially adopted in order to avoid supposed injustices which would otherwise result in the latter. We have held, for example, that the sale of motorcycles to a municipal corporation for use in its police service is not subject to federal taxation, because the maintenance of such a service is a governmental function. Indian Motorcycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 579\n, 604. And while it is true that the weight of authority in tort actions accords with that view, there are state decisions which affirm the liability of a municipality for personal injury resulting from the negligence of its police officials under the circumstances presented in the respective cases dealt with. \n2\n Nevertheless, our \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 364]\n\u00a0\n decision in the Indian Motorcycle Case did not rest in the slightest degree upon a consideration of the state rule in respect of tort actions, but upon a broad consideration of the implied constitutional immunity arising from the dual character of our national and state governments.\n  The rule in respect of municipal liability in tort is a local matter; and whether it shall be strict or liberal or denied altogether is for the state which created the municipality alone to decide (Detroit v. Osborne, \n135 \nU.S. 492, 497\n, 498)-provided, of course, the Federal Constitution be not infringed. But a federal tax in respect of the activities of a state or a state agency is an imposition by one government upon the activities of another, and must accord with the implied federal requirement that state and local governmental functions be not burdened thereby. So long as our present dual form of government endures, the states, it must never be forgotten, 'are as independent of the general government as that government within its sphere is independent of the States.' The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124. And, as it was said in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725, and often has been repeated, 'the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitutions as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government.' The unimpaired existence of both governments is equally essential. It is to that high end that this court has recognized the rule, which rests upon necessary implication, that neither may tax the governmental means and instrumentalities of the other. The Collector v. Day, supra, 11 Wall. 113, at page 127. In the light of these considerations, it follows that the question here presented is not controlled by local law, but is a question of national scope to be resolved in harmony with implied constitutional prin \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 365]\n\u00a0\n ciples of general application. Compare Workman v. New York City, Mayor etc ., \n179 \nU.S. 552, 557\n. This indicated dissimilarity constitutes a distinction which is fundamental; and we put aside the state decisions in tort actions as inapposite. Compare Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 43\n et seq., 608.\n  We thus come to a situation, which the courts have frequently been called upon to meet, where the issue cannot be decided in accordance with an established formula, but where points along the line 'are fixed by decisions that this or that concrete case falls on the nearer or farther side.' Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 531, 14 Ann.Cas. 560. We are, of course, quite able to say that certain functions exercised by a city are clearly governmental- that is, lie upon the nearer side of the line-while others are just as clearly private or corporate in character, and lie upon the farther side. But between these two opposite classes, there is a zone of debatable ground within which the cases must be put upon one side or the other of the line by what this court has called the gradual process of historical and judicial 'inclusion and exclusion.' Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 670\n, 603, and cases cited.\n  We think, therefore, that it will be wise to confine, as strictly as possible, the present inquiry to the necessities of the immediate issue here involved, and not, by an attempt to formulate any general test, risk embarrassing the decision of cases in respect of municipal activities of a different kind which may arise in the future. Cf. Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 397\n, 121, 54 A.L.R. 1016; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 174. In the case last named we had occasion to point out the difficulty, albeit the necessity, as cases arise within the doubtful zone, of drawing the line which separate those activities which have some relation to government but are subject to taxation from those which are immune. 'Experience has shown,' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 366]\n\u00a0\n we said, 'that there is no formula by which that line may be plotted with precision in advance. But recourse may be had to the reason upon which the rule rests, and which must be the guiding principle to control its operation. Its origin was due to the essential requirement of our constitutional system that the federal government must exercise its authority within the territorial limits of the states; and it rests on the conviction that each government in order that it may administer its affairs within its own sphere, must be left free from undue interference by the other.'\n  The public interest in the conservation and distribution of water for a great variety of purposes-ranging from ordinary agricultural, domestic, and sanitary uses, to the preservation of health and of life itself-is obvious and well settled. For the modern city, such conservation and distribution of water in sufficient quantity and in a state of purity is as vital as air. And this vital necessity becomes more and more apparent and pressing as cities increase in population and density of population. It has found, so far, its culminating point in the vast and supreme needs of the city of New York.\n  One of the most striking illustrations of the public interest in the use of water and the governmental power to deal with it is shown in legislation and judicial pronouncement with respect to the arid-land states of the far west. In some of them, the State Constitution asserts public ownership of all unappropriated nonnavigable waters. In Utah, while it was still a territory, a statute conferred the right upon individual land owners to condemn rights of way across the lands of others in order to convey water to the former for irrigation purposes, and declared that such condemnation was for a 'public use.' This court upheld the statute. Clark v. Nash, \n198 \nU.S. 361, 4\n Ann.Cas. 1171. We said that what is a public use may depend upon \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 367]\n\u00a0\n the facts surrounding the subject; pointed out the vital need of water for irrigation in the aridland states, a need which did not exist in the states of the east and where, consequently, a different rule obtained; and held that the court must recognize the difference of climate and soil which rendered necessary differing laws in the two groups of states.\n  Many years ago, Congress, recognizing this difference, passed the Desert Land Act (chapter 107, 19 Stat. 377), by which, among other things, the waters upon the public domain in the arid-land states and territories were dedicated to the use of the public for irrigation and other purposes. Following this act, if not before, all nonnavigable waters then on and belonging to that part of the national domain became publici juris, subject to the plenary control of the aridland states and territories with the right to determine to what extent the rule of appropriation or the common-law rule in respect of riparian rights should obtain. California Oregon Power Co. v. Cement Co., \n295 \nU.S. 142, 155\n et seq., 728. And in Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 94\n, this court entertained and decided a controversy between two states involving the right of private appropriators in Colorado to divert waters for the irrigation of lands in that state from a river naturally and customarily flowing into the state of Kansas. It was held (\n206 \nU.S. 46\n, at page 99, 668) that such a controversy rises 'above a mere question of local private right and involves a matter of state interest, and must be considered from that standpoint.' Cf. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 52 L.Ed 828, 14 Ann.Cas. 560; New Orleans Gas Light Co. v. Drainage Comm., \n197 \nU.S. 453, 460\n; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 261\n.\n  In New Orleans v. Morris, \n105 \nU.S. 600, 602\n, the city had conveyed its waterworks to a corporation formed for the purpose of maintaining and enlarging them. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 368]\n\u00a0\n The city received as consideration shares of stock, which a state statute declared should not be liable to seizure for the debts of the city. It was held the statute did not impair the obligation of any contract, since the shares represented the city's ownership in the waterworks which had, before the enactment of the statute, been exempted from seizure and sale. This ruling was put upon the ground that the waterworks were of such public utility and necessity that they were held in trust for the use of the citizens the same as public parks and public buildings.\n  While thses do not decide, they plainly suggest, that municipal watwrworks created and operated in order to supply the needs of a city and its inhabitants are public works and their operation essentially governmental in character. Other decisions of this court, however, more directly support that conclusion.\n  We recently have held that the bankruptcy statutes could not be extended to municipalities or other political subdivisions of a state. Ashton v. Cameron County Water Imp. Dist., \n298 \nU.S. 513, 895\n. The respondent there was a water-improvement district organized by law to furnish water for irrigation and domestic uses. We said (\n298 \nU.S. 513\n, at pages 527, 528) that respondent was a political subdivision of the state 'created for the local exercise of her sovereign powers. * * * Its fiscal affairs are those of the state, not subject to control or interference by the national government, unless the right so to do is definitely accorded by the Federal Constitution.' In support of that holding, former decisions of this court with respect to the immunity of states and municipalities from federal taxation were relied upon as apposite. The question whether the district exercised governmental or merely corporate functions was distinctly in issue. The petition in bankruptcy alleged that the district was created with power to perform 'the proprietary and\/or corporate function of fur- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 369]\n\u00a0\n nishing water for irrigation and domestic uses. * * *' The district judge ( In re Cameron County Water Imp. Dist. No. 1, 9 F.Supp. 103) held that the district was created for the local exercise of state sovereign powers; that it was exercising 'a governmental function'; that its property was public property; that it was not carrying on private business, but public business. That court, having denied the petition for want of jurisdiction, the district submitted a motion for a new trial in which it assigned, among other things, that the court erred in holding that petitioner was created for the purpose of performing governmental functions, 'for the reason that the Courts of Texas, as well as the other Courts in the Nation, have uniformly held that the furnishing of water for irrigation was purely a proprietary function. * * *' Substantially the same thing was repeated in other assignments of error. In the petition for rehearing in this court ( \n299 \nU.S. 619\n), the district challenged our determination that respondent was a political subdivision of the state 'created for the local exercise of her sovereign powers,' and asserted to the contrary that the facts would demonstrate that 'respondent is a corporation organized for essentially proprietary purposes.' It is not open to dispute that the statements quoted from our opinion in the Ashton Case were made after due consideration, and the case itself of the and the rehearing denied in the light of the issue thus definitely presented. Compare Binghmam v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 211, 218\n, 219, 181.\n'No higher police duty rests upon municipal authority,' this court said in Columbus v. Mercantile Trust Co., \n218 \nU.S. 645, 658\n, 109, 'than that of furnishing an ample supply of pure and wholesome water for public and domestic uses. The preservation of the health of the community is best obtained by the discharge of this duty, to say nothing of the preservation of property from fire, so constant an attendant upon crowded conditions of municipal life.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 370]\n\u00a0\n  In Dunbar v. City of New York, \n251 \nU.S. 516, 251\n, we sustained a charter provision giving a lien for water charges upon a building in which the water had been used, although the charges had been incurred by tenants and not by the owner, saying, 'And as a supply of water is necessary it is only an ordinary and elgal exertion of government to provide means for its compulsory compensation.'\n\n  In German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Homewater Supply Co., \n226 \nU.S. 220, 42\n L.R.A.(N.S.) 1000, the city of Spartanburg had entered into a contract with the respondent by which the latter was empowered to supply the city and its inhabitants with water suitable for fire, sanitary, and domestic purposes. The petitioner had issued a policy of fire insurance upon certain property, which was destroyed by fire. It paid the amount of the loss, and took an assignment from the insured of all claims and demands against any person arising from or connected with the loss. It brought suit against the respondent on the ground that the fire could easily have been extinguished if respondent had complied with its contract. This court held that the action was not maintainable for reasons which appear in the opinion. The city, it was said, was under no legal obligation to furnish water; and it did not subject itself to a new or greater liability because it voluntarily undertook to do so (\n226 \nU.S. 220\n, at pages 227, 228, 34, 42 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1000). 'It acted in a governmental capacity, and was no more responsible for failure in that respect than it would have been for failure to furnish adequate police protection.'\n  We conclude that the acquisition and distribution of a supply of water for the needs of the modern city involve the exercise of essential governmental functions, and this conclusion is fortified by a consideration of the public uses to which the water is put. Without such a supply, public schools, public sewers so necessary to preserve health, fire departments, street sprinkling and cleaning, public buildings, parks, playgrounds, and public baths \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 371]\n\u00a0\n could not exist. And this is equivalent, in a very real sense, to saying that the city itself would then disappear. More than one-fourth of the water furnished by the city of New York, we are told by the record, is utilized for these public purposes. Certainly, the maintenance of public schools, a fire department, a system of sewers, parks, and public buildings, to say nothing of other public facilities and uses, calls for the exercise of governmental functions. And so far as these are concerned, the water supply is a necessary auxiliary, and, therefore, partakes of their nature. People of State of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n (January 4, 1937). Moreover, the health and comfort of the city's population of 7,000,000 souls, and in some degree their very existence, are dependent upon and adequate supply of pure and wholesome water. It may be, as it is suggested, that private corporations would be able and willing to undertake to provide a supply of water for all purposes; but if the state and city of New York be of opinion, as they evidently are, that the service should not be intrusted to private hands, but should be rendered by the city itself as an appropriate means of discharging its duty to protect the health, safety, and lives of its inhabitants, we do not doubt that it may do so in the exercise of its essential governmental functions.\n  We find nothing that detracts from this view in the fact that in former times the business of furnishing water to urban communities, including New York, in fact was left largely, or even entirely, to private enterprise. The tendency for many years has been in the opposite direction, until now in nearly all the larger cities of the country the duty has been assumed by the municipal authorities. Governmental functions are not to be regarded as nonexistent because they are held in abeyance, or because they lie dormant, for a time. If they be by their nature governmental, they are none the less so because the use of them has had a recent beginning. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 372]\n\u00a0\n  The principle finds illustration in our decision in Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 297\n, 389, where it was held that land taken by an exercise of the power of eminent domain for the establishment of Rock Creek Park in the District of Columbia was taken for a public use, and that the amount required to be paid was validly assessed upon lands in the district specially benefited thereby. At the beginning of the opinion in that case, this court said: 'In the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property, without the consent of its owner, for a public park, and to assess a proportionate part of the cost upon real estate benefited thereby, would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power.' It was pointed out that Central Park in New York was the first place provided for the inhabitants of any city or town in the United States as a pleasure ground for rest and exercise in the open air, but that in 1892, when the opinion was written, there was scarcely a city of any considerable size in the country that did not have, or had not projected, such parks.\n  Respondent contends that the municipality, in supplying water to its inhabitants, is engaged in selling water for profit; and seems to think that this, if true, stamps the operation as private and not governmental in character. We first pause to observe that the overhead due to the enormous cost of the system, and the fact that so large a proportion of the water is diverted for public use, rather plainly suggests that no real profit is likely to result. And to say that, because the city makes a charge for furnishing water to private consumers, it follows that the operation of the water works is corporate and not governmental, is to beg the question. What the city is engaged in doing in that respect is rather rendering a service than selling a commodity. If that service be governmental, it does not become private because a charge is made for it, or a profit realized. A state, for example, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 373]\n\u00a0\n constructs and operates a highway. It may, if it choose, exact compensation for its use from those who travel over it (see Bingaman v. Golden Eagle Western Lines, \n297 \nU.S. 626, 628\n); but this does not destory the claim that the maintenance of the highway is a public and governmental function. The state or the city may exact a tuition charge for instruction in the public schools; but thereby the maintenance of the public schools does not cease to be a function of the government. The state exacts a fee for issuing a license or granting a permit; for recording a deed; for rendering a variety of services in the judicial department. Do these various services thereby lose their character as governmental functions? The federal Post Office Department charges for its services; but no one would question the fact that its operation calls into exercise a governmental function.\n  The contention is made that our decisions in South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 461\n, 462, 4 Ann.Cas. 737, and Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 172\n, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312, are to the effect that the supplying of water is not a governmental function; but in neither case was that question in issue, and what was said by the court was wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the cases and merely by way of illustration. Expressions of that kind may be respected, but do not control in a subsequent case when the precise point is presented for decision. Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 98\n (February 1, 1937), and authorities cited. The prcise point is presented here, has been fully considered, and is decided otherwise. Neither Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360\n, nor Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214\n, relied upon by respondent, is in point. What has already been said distinguishes those cases from the one now under consideration.\n  We have not failed to give careful consideration to Blair v. Byers (C. C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 326, and Denman v. Com'r Int. Rev. (C.C.A.) 73 F.(2d) 193, both of which take a view con- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 374]\n\u00a0\n trary to that which we have expressed. To the extent of this conflict, those cases are disapproved. Both rely on South Carolina v. United States and Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, which we have already distinguished.\n  Reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO, concurring in the result:\n  We concur in the result upon the ground that the petitioner has brought himself within the terms of the exemption prescribed by Treasury Regulation 74, Article 643, which for the purposes of this case may be accepted as valid, its validity not being challenged by counsel for the government.\n  In the absence of such a challenge, no opinion is expressed as to the need for revision of the doctrine of implied immunities declared in earlier decisions.\n  We leave that subject open.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, dissenting.\n  I regret that I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court. I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n  There is no occasion now to discuss the dual character of our form of government, and the consequent dual allegiance of a citizen of a state to his state and to the United States, to elaborate the thesis that the integrity of each government is to be maintained against invasions by the other or to reiterate that the implied immunity of the one from taxation by the other springs from the necessity that neither shall, by the exercise of the power to tax, burden, hinder, or destory the operation or existence of the other. There is universal recognition of the truth of these tenets, and of their fundamental relation to the preservation of the constitutional framework of the nation. Our difficulties arise, not in their statement as guiding principles, but, as in this instance, in their application to specific cases. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 375]\n\u00a0\n  The frank admissions of counsel at the bar concerning the confusion and apparent inconsistency in administrative rulings as to the taxability of compensation of municipal employees seem to call for an equally candid statement that our decisions in the same field have not furnished the executive a consistent rule of action. The need of equitable and uniform administration of tax laws, national and state, and the just demand of the citizen that the rules governing the enforcement of those laws shall be ascertainable require an attempt at rationalization and restatement.\n  It seems to me that the reciprocal rights and immunities of the national and a state government may be safeguarded by the observance of two limitations upon their respective powers of taxation. These are that the exactions of the one must not discriminate against the means and instrumentalities of the other and must not directly burden the operations of that other. To state these canons otherwise, an exaction by either government which hits the means or instrumentalities of the other infringes the principle of immunity if it discriminates against them and in favor of private citizens or if the burden of the tax be palpable and direct rather than hypothetic and remote. Tested by these criteria the imposition of the challenged tax in the instant case was lawful.\n  The petitioner is a citizen of New York. By virtue of that status, he is also a citizen of the United States. He owes allegiance to each government. He derives income from the exercise of his profession. His obligation as a citizen is to contribute to the support of the governments under whose joint protection he lives and pursues his calling. His liability to fulfill that obligation to the national government by payment of income tax upon his salary would be unquestioned were it not for the character of his employer. If the water works of New York \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 376]\n\u00a0\n City were operated by a private corporation under a public franchise and if the petitioner held a like position with the corporation, there could be no question that the imposition of a federal income tax, measured by his compensation, would be justified. If petitioner, instead of holding a so-called official position under the municipal goverment of New York City, were consulted from time to time with respect to its water problems his compensation would be subject to income tax. Metchlf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n. He is put into an untaxable class upon the theory that as an official of the municipality, which in turn is an arm of the state, he is an 'instrumentality' of the state, and to tax him upon his salary is to lay a burden upon the state government which, however trifling, is forbidden by the implied immunity of the state from burdens imposed by the United States. The petitioner seeks to show the reality of the supposed burden by the suggestion that if his salary and the compensation of others employed by the city is subject to federal income tax, the municipality will be compelled to pay higher salaries in order to obtain the services of such persons and the consequent aggregate increase in outlay will entail a heavy financial load. We know, however, that professional services are offered in the industrial and business field; and that while there is no hard and fast standard of compensation, and men bargain for their rewards, salaries do bear some relation to experience and ability. There is a market in which a professional man offers his services and municipalities are bidders in that market. We know further that those in private employment holding positions comparable to that of the petitioner pay a tax equal to that levied upon him. It is clear that any consideration of the petitioner's immunity from federal income tax would be altogether remote, impalpable, and unascertainable in influencing \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 377]\n\u00a0\n him to accept a position under the municipality rather than under a private employer.\n  In reason and logic it is difficult to differentiate the present case from that of a private citizen who furnishes goods, performs work, or renders service to a state or a municipality under a contract or an officer or employee of a corporation which does the same. Income tax on the compensation paid or the profit realized is a necessary cost incident to the performance of the contract and as such must be taken into account in fixing the consideration demanded of the city government. In quite as real a sense, as in this case, the taxation of income of such persons and, as well, the taxation of the corporation itself, lays a burden upon the funds of the state or its agency. Nevertheless, the courts have repeatedly declared that the doctrine of immunity will not serve to exempt such persons or corporations from the exaction.\n  The importance of the case arises out of the fact that the claimed exemption may well extend to millions of persons (whose work nowise differs from that of their fellows in private enterprise) who are employed by municipal subdivisions and districts throughout the nation and that, on the other hand, the powers of the states to tax may be inhibited in the case of hundreds of thousands of similar employees of federal agencies of one sort or another. Such exemptions from taxation ought to be strictly limited. They are essentially unfair. They are unsound because federal or state business ought to bear its proportionate share of taxation in order that comparison may be made between the cost of conducting public and private business.\n  We are here concerned only with the question of the taxation of salaries or compensation received by those rendering to a municipality services of the same kind as are rendered to private employers and need not go be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 352\n, 378]\n\u00a0\n yond the precise issue here presented. We have no concern with the exaction of a sales tax by the federal goverment on sales to a state government or one of its subdivisions, or the reverse; we are not called upon to define the power to levy taxes upon real property owned by a state or by the national government. We have no occasion to discuss the power of either government to impose excise taxes upon transactions of the other or upon the evidence of such transactions. Nor are we called upon here to determine the validity of a nondiscriminatory tax upon the salary of a governmental officer whose duties and functions have no analogue in the conduct of a business or the pursuit of a profession, but are both peculiar to and essential to the operation of government. The sole question here is whether one performing work or rendering service of a type commonly done or rendered in ordinary commercial life for gain is exempt form the normal burden of a tax on that gain for the support of the national government because his compensation is paid by a state agency instead of a private employer. I think the imposition of a tax upon such gain where, as here, the tax falls equally upon all employed in like occupation, and where the supposed burden of the tax upon state government is indicrect, remote, and imponderable, is not inconsistent with the principle of immunity inherent in the constitutional relation of state and nation.\n  Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this opinion. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is brought out in a careful and detailed review by Professor Borchard in that portion of his general discussion of 'Government Liability in Tort' dealing with municipal corporations, to be found in 1924-5) 34 Yale L.J. 129143, 229258, in the course of which the courts 129): 'Disagreement among the courts as to many customary muncipal acts and functions may almost be said to be more common than agreement and the elaboration of the varying justifications for their classification is even less satisfying to any demand for principle in the law. Indeed, so hopeless did the effort of the courts to make an appropriate classification of functions appear to the Supreme Court of South Carolina that they determined to abandon the distinction between governmental and corporate acts.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Herron v.

These employers include all who employ eight or more persons for twenty or more weeks in the year, section 2(f), except those engaged in certain specified employments. \n1\n It imposes \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 506]\n\u00a0\n on the employers the obligation to pay a certain percentage of their total monthly pay rolls into the state Unemployment Compensation Fund, administered by appellants. For 1936 the levy is .9 of 1 per cent.; for 1937 it is 1.8 per cent., and for 1938 and subsequent years it is 2.7 per cent. Section 4(b). In 1941 and thereafter the rates of contribution by employers are to be revised in accordance with experience, but in no case are they to be less than 1 1\/2 or more than 4 per cent. of the pay roll. Section 4(c). After May 1, 1936, each employee is required to contribute 1 per cent. of his wages to the fund. Section 4(d). The fund is to be deposited in the 'Unemployment Trust Fund' of the United States Government, section 3(d), cf. Social Security Act,  904(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1104(a), and is to be used as requisitioned by the State Commission to pay unemployment benefits prescribed by the statute, sections 3(b), 3(d), but without any liability on the part of the state beyond amounts paid into or earned by the fund. Benefits are payable from the fund to the employees covered by the Act, in the event of their unem- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 507]\n\u00a0\n ployment, upon prescribed conditions and at prescribed rates.\n The Act satisfies the criteria which, by section 903(a) of the Social Security Act of August 14, 1935, c. 531, 49 Stat. 620, 640, 42 U.S.C.  1103(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a), are made prerequisite to its approval by the Social Security Board created by that Act, and it has been approved by the Board as that section directs. By section 902 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A.  1102, contributors to the state fund are entitled to credit their contributions in satisfaction of the tax imposed on employers by the Social Security Act, to the extent of 90 per cent. of the tax. See Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed . --, decided this day.\n In the court below, the statute was assailed as repugnant to various provisions of the State Constitution. These contentions have been put at rest by the decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama in Beeland Wholesale Company v. Kaufman, 174 So. 516, holding the state act valid under both the State and Federal Constitutions. The statute was also attacked on the ground that the Social Security Act is invalid under the Federal Constitution, since the state act declares that it 'shall become void' if the Supreme Court of the United States shall hold the Social Security Act invalid. The Alabama court interpreted the statute as having operative effect only if the Social Security Act were constitutional-even in advance of a decision by this Court. We need not decide whether the state court's ruling that the federal statute is valid is conclusive upon us for the purpose of determining whether the state law is presently in force, Miller's Executors v. Swann, \n150 \nU.S. 132\n, 14 S.Ct. 52; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n237 \nU.S. 300\n, 35 S.Ct. 598, because its conclusion as to the validity of the federal act agrees with our own, announced in Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra.\n Attacks were leveled on the statute on numerous other grounds, which are urged here-as an infringement of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 508]\n\u00a0\n the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as an unconstitutional surrender to the United States government of the sovereign power of the state, and as a measure owing its passage to the coercive action of Congress in the enactment of the Social Security Act.\n In Beeland Wholesale Company v. Kaufman, supra, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the contributions which the statute exacts of employers are excise taxes laid in conformity to the constitution and laws of the state. While the particular name which a state court or legislature may give to a money payment commanded by its statute is not controlling here when its constitutionality is in question, cf. Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 171, 71 A.L.R. 1226; Storaasli v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 51 S.Ct. 354, 355; Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 104 S., 40 S.Ct. 93, 94, 168; Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 39 S.Ct. 320, we see no reason to doubt that the present statute is an exertion of the taxing power of the state. Cf. Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 71\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 206, 68 A.L.R. 194.\n Taxes, which are but the means of distributing the burden of the cost of government, are commonly levied on property or its use, but they may likewise be laid on the exercise of personal rights and privileges. As has been pointed out by the opinion in the Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. Case, such levies, including taxes on the exercise of the right to employ or to be employed, were known in England and the Colonies before the adoption of the Constitution, and must be taken to be embraced within the wide range of choice of subjects of taxation, which was an attribute of the sovereign power of the states at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and which was reserved to them by that instrument. As the present levy has all the indicia of a tax, and is of a type traditional in the history of Anglo- American legislation, it is within state taxing power, and it is immaterial whether it is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 509]\n\u00a0\n called an excise or by another name. See Barwide v. Sheppard, \n299 \nU.S. 33, 36\n, 57 S.Ct. 70, 71. Its validity under the Federal Constitution is to be determined in the light of constitutional principles applicable to state taxation.\n Validity of the Tax Under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n First. Validity of the Tax Qua Tax. It is inherent in the exercise of the power to tax that a state be free to select the subjects of taxation and to grant exemptions. Neither due process nor equal protection imposes upon a state any rigid rule of equality of taxation. See Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 558, 87 A.L.R. 374. This Court has repeatedly held that inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption, infringe no constitutional limitation. Magoun v.

A legislature is not bound to tax every member of a class or none. It may make distinctions of degree having a rational basis, and when subjected to judicial scrutiny they must be presumed to rest on that basis if there is any conceivable state of facts which would support it. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A.1917A, 421, Ann.Cas.1917B, 455; Heisler v.

State Tax Commission, supra; cf. Metropolitan Casualty Insurance Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540.\n This restriction upon the judicial function, in passing on the constitutionality of statutes, is not artificial or irrational. A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution. In the nature of the case it cannot record a complete catalogue of the considerations which move its members to enact laws. In the absence of such a record courts cannot assume that its action is capricious, or that, with its informed acquaintance with local conditions to which the legislation is to be applied, it was not aware of facts which afford reasonable basis for its action. Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.\n Exclusion of Employers of Less than Eight. Distinctions in degree, stated in terms of differences in number, have often been the target of attack, see Booth v. Indiana, \n237 \nU.S. 391, 397\n, 35 S.Ct. 617. It is argued here, and it was ruled by the court below, that there can be no reason for a distinction, for purposes of taxation, between those who have only seven employees and those who have eight. Yet, this is the type of distinction which the law is often called upon to make. \n2\n It is only a difference in numbers \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 511]\n\u00a0\n which marks the moment when day ends and night begins, when the disabilities of infancy terminate and the status of legal competency is assumed. It separates large incomes which are taxed from the smaller ones which are exempt, as it marks here the difference between the proprietors of larger businesses who are taxed and the proprietors of smaller businesses who are not.\n Administrative convenience and expense in the collection or measurement of the tax are alone a sufficient justification for the difference between the treatment of small incomes or small taxpayers and that meted out to others. Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322, 332\n, 33 S.Ct. 833; New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 159\n, 27 S.Ct. 188, 9 Ann.Cas. 736; New York v. Latrobe, \n279 \nU.S. 421, 428\n, 49 S.Ct. 377, 379, 65 A.L.R. 1341; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm., \n295 \nU.S. 285, 289\n, 55 S.Ct. 709, 710; Cf. Florida Central & Peninsular R. Co. v. Reynolds, \n183 \nU.S. 471, 480\n, 22 S.Ct. 176; Packer Corp. v. Utah, \n285 \nU.S. 105\n, 110, footnote 6, 52 S.Ct. 273, 274, 647, 79 A.L.R. 546, 549. We cannot say that the expense and inconvenience of collecting the tax from small employers would not be disproportionate to the revenue obtained. For it cannot be assumed that the legislature could not rightly have concluded that generally the number of employees bears a relationship to the size of the pay roll and therefore to the amount of the tax, and that the large number of small employers and the paucity of their records of employment would entail greater inconvenience in the collection and verification of the tax than in the case of larger employers.\n It would hardly be contended that the state, in order to tax pay rolls, is bound to assume the administrative cost and burden of taxing all employers having a single employee. But if for that or any other reason it may exempt some, whether it should draw the line at one, three, or seven, is peculiarly a question for legislative decision. The decision cannot be said to be arbitrary because it falls in the twilight zone between those members of the class \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 512]\n\u00a0\n which plainly can and those which plainly cannot expediently be taxed.\n Exemption of Particular Classes of Employers. It is arbitrary, appellees contend, to exempt those who employ agricultural laborers, domestic servants, seamen, insurance agents, or close relatives, or to exclude charitable institutions, interstate railways, or the government of the United States or of any state or political subdivision. A sufficient answer is an appeal to the principle of taxation already stated, that the state is free to select a particular class as a subject for taxation. The character of the exemptions suggests simply that the state has chosen, as the subject of its tax, those who employ labor in the processes of industrial production and distribution.\n Reasons for the selections, if desired, readily suggest themselves. Where the public interest is served one business may be left untaxed and another taxed, in order to promote the one, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, supra; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., supra; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm., supra, or to restrict or suppress the other, Magnano Company v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599; Fox v. Standard Oil Co., supra; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, \n233 \nU.S. 304\n, 34 S.Ct. 493; Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, supra, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219, 220; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company v. Grosjean, supra. The legislature may withhold the burden of the tax in order to foster what it conceives to be a beneficent enterprise. This Court has often sustained the exemption of charitable institutions, Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533; cf. Board of Education v. Illinois, \n203 \nU.S. 553, 563\n, 27 S. Ct. 171, 8 Ann.Cas. 157, and exemption for the encouragement of agriculture, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, supra, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm., supra, \n295 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 55 S.Ct. 709, 711. Similarly, the legislature is free to aid a depressed industry such as shipping. The exemption of business operating for less than twenty weeks in the year \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 513]\n\u00a0\n may rest upon similar reasons, or upon the desire to encourage seasonal or unstable industries.\n Administrative considerations may explain several exemptions. Relatively great expense and inconvenience of collection may justify the exemption from taxation of domestic employers, farmers, and family businesses, not likely to maintain adequate employment records, which are an important aid in the collection and verification of the tax. The state may reasonably waive the formality of taxing itself or its political subdivisions. Fear of constitutional restrictions, and a wholesome respect for the proper policy of another sovereign, would explain exemption of the United States, and of the interstate railways, compare Packer Corp. v. Utah, supra, \n285 \nU.S. 105, 109\n, 52 S.Ct. 273, 274, 79 A.L.R. 546. In no case do appellees sustain the burden which rests upon them of showing that there are no differences, between the exempt employers and the industrial employers who are taxed, sufficient to justify differences in taxation.\n Tax on Employees. Appellees extend their attack on the statute from the tax imposed on them as employers to the tax imposed on employees. But they cannot object to a tax which they are not asked to pay, at least if it is separable, as we think it is, from the tax they must pay. The statute contains the usual separability clause. Section 19. The taxation of employees is not prerequisite to enjoyment of the benefits of the Social Security Act. The collection and expenditure of the tax on employers do not depend upon taxing the employees, and we find nothing in the language of the statute or its application to suggest that the tax on employees is so essential to the operation of the statute as to restrict the effect of the separability clause. Distinct taxes imposed by a single statute are not to be deemed inseparable unless that conclusion is unavoidable. See Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 697\n, 12 S.Ct. 495; Sonzinsky v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 506\n, 57 S.Ct. 554, March 29, 1937. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 514]\n\u00a0\n From what has been said, it is plain that the tax qua tax conforms to constitutional requirements, and that our inquiry as to its validity would end at this point if the proceeds of the tax were to be covered into the state treasury, and thus made subject to appropriation by the legislature.\n Second. Validity of the Tax as Determined by Its Purposes. The devotion of the tax to the purposes specified by the Act requires our consideration of the objections pressed upon us that the tax is invalid because the purposes are invalid, and because the methods chosen for their execution transgress constitutional limitations. It is not denied that since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment state taxing power can be exerted only to effect a public purpose and does not embrace the raising of revenue for private purposes. See Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233, 238\n, 40 S.Ct. 499, 501; Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel Imp. Dist., \n262 \nU.S. 710, 717\n, 43 S.Ct. 694, 696; Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 158\n, 17 S.Ct. 56; Jones v. City of Portland, \n245 \nU.S. 217, 221\n, 38 S.Ct. 112, L.R.A.1918C, 765, Ann.Cas.1918E, 660. The states, by their constitutions and laws, may set their own limits upon their spending power, see Citizens' Savings & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655; cf. Parkersburg v. Brown, \n106 \nU.S. 487\n, 1 S.Ct. 442; Cole v. La Grange, \n113 \nU.S. 1\n, 5 S.Ct. 416, but the requirements of due process leave free scope for the exercise of a wide legislative discretion in determining what expenditures will serve the public interest.\n This Court has long and consistently recognized that the public purposes of a state, for which it may raise funds by taxation, embrace expenditures for its general welfare. Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, supra, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 161\n, 17 S.Ct. 56; Green v. Frazier, supra, \n253 \nU.S. 233, 240\n, 241 S., 40 S.Ct. 499, 501, 502. The existence of local conditions which, because of their nature and extent, are of concern to the public as a whole, the modes of advancing the public interest by correcting them or avoiding their consequences, are peculiarly within the knowl- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 515]\n\u00a0\n edge of the legislature, and to it, and not to the courts, is committed the duty and responsibility of making choice of the possible methods. See Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, supra, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 160\n, 17 S.Ct. 56; Jones v. City of Portland, supra, \n245 \nU.S. 217, 221\n, 224 S., 225, 38 S.Ct. 112, L.R.A.1918C, 765, Ann.Cas.1918E, 660; Green v. Frazier, supra, \n253 \nU.S. 233, 239\n, 240 S., 40 S.Ct. 499, 501. As with expenditures for the general welfare of the United States, United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1, 67\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 319, 102 A.L.R. 914; Helvering et al. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 619, 672\n, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. --, whether the present expenditure serves a public purpose is a practical question addressed to the lawmaking department, and it would require a plain case of departure from every public purpose which would reasonably be conceived to justify the intervention of a court. See Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra; cf. Jones v. City of Portland, supra. The present case exhibits no such departure.\n Relief of Unemployment as a Public Purpose. Support of the poor has long been recognized as a public purpose, see Kelly v. Pittsburgh, \n104 \nU.S. 78\n, 81. We need not labor the point that expenditures for the relief of the unemployed, conditioned on unemployment alone, without proof of indigence of recipients of the benefits, is a permissible use of state funds. For the past six years the nation, unhappily, has been placed in a position to learn at first hand the nature and extent of the problem of unemployment, and to appreciate its profound influence upon the public welfare. Detailed accounts of the problem and its social and economic consequences, to be found in public reports of the expenditures of relief funds, and in the studies of many observers, afford a basis for the legislative judgment. It suffices to say that they show that unemployment apparently has become a permanent incident of our industrial system; that it varies, in extent and intensity, with fluctuations in the volume of seasonal businesses and with the business cycle. It is dependent, with special and unpredictable manifestations, upon tech- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 516]\n\u00a0\n nological changes and advances in methods of manufacture, upon changing demands for manufactured products-dictated by changes in fashion or the creation of desirable substitutes, and upon the establishment of new sources of competition.\n The evils of the attendant social and economic wastage permeate the entire social structure. Apart from poverty, or a less extreme impairment of the savings which afford the chief protection to the working class against old age and the hazards of illness, a matter of inestimable consequence to society as a whole, and apart from the loss of purchasing power, the legislature could have concluded that unemployment brings in its wake increase in vagrancy and crimes against property,3 reduction in the number of marriages,4 deterioration of family life, decline in the birth rate,5 increase in illegitimate births,6 impairment of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 517]\n\u00a0\n the health of the unemployed and their families7 and malnutrition of their children. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Although employment in Alabama is predominantly in agriculture, and the court below found that agricultural unemployment is not an acute problem, the census reports disclose the steadily increasing percentage of those employed in industrial pursuits in Alabama. \n9\n The total amount spent for emergency relief in Alabama, in the years 1933 to 1935 inclusive, exceeded $47,000,000, of which $312,000 came from state funds, $2,243,000 from local sources and the balance from relief funds of the federal government. \n10\n These figures bear eloquent witness to the inability of local agencies to cope with the problem without state action and resort to new taxing legislation. Expenditure of public funds under the present statute, for relief of unemployment, will afford some \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 518]\n\u00a0\n protection to a substantial group of employees,11 and we cannot say that it is not for a public purpose.\n The end being legitimate, the means is for the legislature to choose. When public evils ensue from individual misfortunes or needs, the legislature may strike at the evil at its source. If the purpose is legitimate because public, it will not be defeated because the execution of it involves payments to individuals. Kelly v. Pittsburgh, supra; Knights v. Jackson, \n260 \nU.S. 12, 15\n, 43 S.Ct. 1; cf. Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 239\n, 240 S., 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642. 'Individual interests are aided only as the common interest is safeguarded.' See Cochran v. Louisiana State Board of Education, \n281 \nU.S. 370, 375\n, 50 S.Ct. 335, 336; cf. Clark v. Nash, \n198 \nU.S. 361, 367\n, 25 S.Ct. 676, 4 Ann.Cas. 1171; Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 598, 608\n, 28 S.Ct. 331, 13 Ann.Cas. 1008; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 110\n, 31 S.Ct. 186, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1062, Ann.Cas.1912A, 487.\n Extension of Benefits. The present scheme of unemployment relief is not subject to any constitution infirmity, as respondents argue, because it is not limited to the indigent or because it is extended to some less deserving than others, such as those discharged for misconduct. While we may assume that the state could have limited its award of unemployment benefits to the indigent and to those who had not been rightfully discharged from their employment, it was not bound to do so. Pov- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 519]\n\u00a0\n erty is one, but not the only evil consequence of unemployment. Among the benefits sought by relief is the avoidance of destitution, and of the gathering cloud of evils which beset the worker, his family and the community after wages cease and before destitution begins. We are not unaware that industrial workers are not an affluent class, and we cannot say that a scheme for the award of unemployment benefits, to be made only after a substantial 'waiting period' of unemployment, and then only to the extent of half wages and not more than $15 a week for at most 16 weeks a year, does not effect a public purpose, because it does not also set up an elaborate machinery for excluding those from its benefits who are not indigent. Moreover, the state could rightfully decide not to discourage thrift. Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, supra, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 240\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642. And as the injurious effects of unemployment are not limited to the unemployed worker, there is scope for legislation to mitigate those effects, even though unemployment results from his discharge for cause.\n Restriction of Benefits. Appellees again challenge the tax by attacking as arbitrary the classification adopted by the legislature for the distribution of unemployment benefits. Only the employees of those subject to the tax share in the benefits. Appellees complain that the relief is withheld from many as deserving as those who receive benefits. The choice of beneficiaries, like the selection of the subjects of the tax, is thus said to be so arbitrary and discriminatory as to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment and deprive the statute of any public purpose.\n What we have said as to the validity of the choice of the subjects of the tax is applicable in large measure to the choice of beneficiaries of the relief. In establishing a system of unemployment benefits the legislature is not bound to occupy the whole field. It may strike at the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 520]\n\u00a0\n evil where it is most felt, Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 610\n, 23 S.Ct. 168; Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 26 S.Ct. 66; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 81\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann.Cas.1912C, 160; Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 160\n, 33 S.Ct. 66; Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 270\n, 33 S.Ct. 27, Ann.Cas.1914B, 71; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S.Ct. 281; Keokee Consol. Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S.Ct. 856; Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S.Ct. 57, 58, 65 A.L.R. 939; Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 159\n, 52 S.Ct. 69, 71, or where it is most practicable to deal with it, Dominion Hotel Inc., v. Arizona, \n249 \nU.S. 265, 268\n, 269 S., 39 S.Ct. 273. It may exclude others whose need is less, New York, N.H. & H.R. Co. v. New York, \n165 \nU.S. 628, 634\n, 17 S.Ct. 418; St. Louis Consol. Coal Co. v. Illinois, \n185 \nU.S. 203, 208\n, 22 S.Ct. 616; Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 \nU.S. 128, 138\n, 31 S.Ct. 190; New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 208\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A.1917D, 1, Ann.Cas.1917D, 629; Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S.Ct. 325, 326; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, March 29, 1937, or whose effective aid is attended by inconvenience which is greater, Dominion Hotel, Inc., v. Arizona, supra; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State, 135 Ga. 545, at pages 555, 556, 69 S.E. 725, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 20, as affirmed and approved, Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 289\n, 34 S.Ct. 829.\n As we cannot say that these considerations did not lead to the selection of the classes of employees entitled to unemployment benefits, and as a state of facts may reasonably be conceived which would support the selection, its constitutionality must be sustained. There is a basis, on grounds of administrative convenience and expense, for adopting a classification which would permit the use of records, kept by the taxpayer and open to the tax gatherer, as an aid to the administration of benefit awards, as is the case here, where the recipients of benefits are selected from the employees of those who pay the tax. Special complaint is made of the discrimination against those with only six co-workers, as contrasted with those who have more. We have already shown that a distinction in terms of the number of employees is not on its face in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 521]\n\u00a0\n valid. \n12\n Here the legislative choice finds support in the conclusion reached by students of the problem,13 that unemployment is less likely to occur in businesses having a small number of employees.\n Third. Want of Relationship Between the Subjects and Benefits of the Tax. It is not a valid objection to the present tax, conforming in other respects to the Fourteenth Amendment, and devoted to a public purpose, that the benefits paid and the persons to whom they are paid are unrelated to the persons taxed and the amount of the tax which they pay-in short, that those who pay the tax may not have contributed to the unemployment and may not be benefited by the expenditure. Appellees' contention that the statute is arbitrary, in so far as it fails to distinguish between the employer with a low unemployment experience and the employer with a high unemployment experience, rests upon the misconception that there must be such a relationship between the subject of the tax (the exercise of the right to employ) and the evil to be met by the appropriation of the proceeds (unemployment). We have recently stated the applicable doctrine. 'But if the tax, qua tax, be good, as we hold it is, and the purpose specified be one which would sustain a subsequent and separate appropriation made out of the general funds of the Treasury, neither is made invalid by being bound to the other in the same act of legislation.' Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra. Nothing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 522]\n\u00a0\n benefit from its expenditure, and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n A tax is not an assessment of benefits. It is, as we have said, a means of distributing the burden of the cost of government. The only benefit to which the taxpayer is constitutionally entitled is that derived from his enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society, established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes. See Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra. Any other view would preclude the levying of taxes except as they are used to compensate for the bur- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 523]\n\u00a0\n den on those who pay them, and would involve the abandonment of the most fundamental principle of government-that it exists primarily to privide for the common good. A corporation cannot object to the use of the taxes which it pays for the maintenance of schools because it has no children. Thomas v. Gay, \n169 \nU.S. 264, 280\n, 18 S.Ct. 340. This Court has repudiated the suggestion, whenever made, that the Constitution requires the benefits derived from the expenditure of public moneys to be apportioned to the burdens of the taxpayer, or that he can resist the payment of the tax because it is not expended for purposes which are peculiarly beneficial to him. \n15\n Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra; Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 72\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 206, 68 A.L.R. 194; Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 268\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 350, 87 A.L.R. 1191; see Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 203\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493.\n Even if a legislature should undertake, what the Constitution does not require, to place the burden of tax for unemployment benefits upon those who cause or contribute to unemployment, it might conclude that the burden cannot justly be apportioned among employers \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 524]\n\u00a0\n according to their unemployment experience. Unemployment in the plant of one employer may be due to competition with another, within or without the state, whose factory is running to capacity; or to tariffs, inventions, changes in fashions or in market or business conditions, for which no employer is responsible, but which may stimulate the business of one and impair or even destroy that of another. Many believe that the responsibility for the business cycle, the chief cause of unemployment, cannot be apportioned to individual employers in accordance with their employment experience; that a business may be least responsible for the depression from which it suffers the most.\n The Alabama legislature may have proceeded upon the view, for which there is abundant authority, that the causes of unemployment are too complex to admit of a meticulous appraisal of employer responsibility. \n16\n It may have concluded that unemployment is an inseparable incident of modern industry, with its most serious manifestations in industrial production; that employees will be best protected, and that the cost of the remedy, at least until more accurate and complete data are available, may best be distributed, by imposing the tax evenly upon all industrial production,17 and in such form that it will be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 525]\n\u00a0\n added to labor costs which are ultimately absorbed by the public in the prices which it pays for consumable goods.\n If the question were ours to decide, we could not say that the legislature, in adopting the present scheme rather than another, had no basis for its choice, or was arbitrary or unreasonable in its action. But, as the state is free to distribute the burden of a tax without regard to the particular purpose for which it is to be used, there is no warrant in the Constitution for setting the tax aside because a court thinks that it could have drawn a better statute or could have distributed the burden more wisely. Those are functions reserved for the legislature.\n Since the appellees may not complain if the expenditure has no relation to the taxed class of which they are members, they obviously may not complain because the expenditure has some relation to that class, that those benefited are employees of those taxed; or because the legislature has adopted the expedient of spreading the burden of the tax to the consuming public by imposing it upon those who make and sell commodities. It is irrelevant to the permissible exercise of the power to tax that some pay the tax who have not occasioned its expenditure, or that in the course of the use of its proceeds for a public purpose the legislature has benefited individuals, who may or may not be related to those who are taxed.\n Relationship of the State and Federal Statutes.\n There remain for consideration the contentions that the state act is invalid because its enactment was coerced by the adoption of the Social Security Act, and that it involves an unconstitutional surrender of state power. Even though it be assumed that the exercise of a sovereign power by a state, in other respects valid, may be rendered invalid because of the coercive effect of a federal statute enacted in the exercise of a power granted to the national government, such coercion is lacking here. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 526]\n\u00a0\n It is unnecessary to repeat now those considerations which have led to our decision in the Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. Case, that the Social Security Act has no such coercive effect. As the Social Security Act is not coercive in its operation, the Unemployment Compensation Act cannot be set aside as an unconstitutional product of coercion. The United States and the State of Alabama are not alien governments. They coexist within the same territory. Unemployment within it is their common concern. Together the two statutes now before us embody a cooperative legislative effort by state and national governments for carrying out a public purpose common to both, which neither could fully achieve without the cooperation of the other. The Constitution does not prohibit such cooperation.\n As the state legislation is not the product of a prohibited coercion, there is little else to which appellees can point as indicating a surrender of state sovereignty. As the opinion in the Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. Case points out, full liberty of action is secured to the state by both statutes. The unemployment compensation fund is administered in accordance with state law by the state commission. The statute may be repealed at the will of the legislature, and in that case the state will be free to withdraw at any time its unexpended share of the Unemployment Trust Fund from the treasury of the United States, and to use it for any public purpose. And, for the reasons stated in the opinion in the Chas. C. Steward Machine Co. Case, we conclude that the deposit by the state of its compensation fund in the Unemployment Trust Fund involves no more of a surrender of sovereignty than does the choice of any other depository for state funds. The power to contract and the power to select appropriate agencies and instrumentalities for the execution of state policy are attributes of state sovereignty. They are not lost by their exercise. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 527]\n\u00a0\n Many other arguments are pressed upon us. They require no discussion save as their answer is implicit in what we have said. The state compensation act, on its face, and as applied to appellees, is subject to no constitutional infirmity, and the decree below is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks that the decree should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n The objective sought by the Alabama statute here in question, namely, the relief of unemployment, I do not doubt is one within the constitutional power of the state. But it is an objective which must be attained by legislation which does not violate the due process or the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This statute, in my opinion, does both, although it would have been a comparatively simply it would have been a comparatively simple\n The statute lays a pay-roll tax upon employers, the proceeds of which go into a common fund to be distributed for the relief of such ex- employees, coming within the provisions of the statute, as shall have lost their employment in any of a designated variety of industries within the state. Some of these employers are engaged in industries where work continues the year round. Others are engaged in seasonal occupations, where the work is discontinued for a part of the year. Some of the employers are engaged in industries where the number of men employed remains stable, or fairly so, while others are engaged in industries where the number of the men employed fluctuates greatly from time to time. Plainly, a disproportionately heavy burden will be imposed by the tax upon those whose operations contribute least to the evils of unemployment, and, correspondingly, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 528]\n\u00a0\n the burden will be lessened in respect of those whose operations contribute most.\n An example will make this clear. Let us suppose that A, an employer of a thousand men, has retained all of his employees. B, an employer of a thousand men, has discharged half of his employees. The tax is upon the pay roll of each. A, who has not discharged a single workman, is taxed upon his pay roll twice as much as B, although the operation of B's establishment has contributed enormously to the evil of unemployment while that of A has contributed nothing at all. It thus results that the employer who has kept all his men at work pays twice as much toward the relief of the employees discharged by B as B himself pays. Moreover, when we consider the large number and the many kinds of industries, their differing characteristics and the varied circumstances by which their operations are conditioned, the gross unfairness of this unequal burden of the tax becomes plain beyond peradventure. It is the same unfairness, in an aggravated form, as that which we so recently condemned as fatally arbitrary in Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S. Ct. 758. That case dealt with a federal statute which established a pension plan requiring payments to be made by all interstate railroad carriers into a pooled fund to be used for the payment of annuities indiscriminately to railroad employees, of whatever company, when they had reached the age of 65 years. This court, because of this pooling feature, among other things, held the act to be bad. We said (\n295 \nU.S. 330\n, at page 357, 55 S.Ct. 758, 765):' 'This court has repeatedly had occasion to say that the railroads, though their property be dedicated to the public use, remain the private property of their owners, and that their assets may not be taken without just compensation. The carriers have not ceased to be privately operated and privately owned, however much subject to \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 529]\n\u00a0\n regulation in the interest of interstate commerce. There is no warrant for taking the property or money of one and transferring it to another without compensation, whether the object of the transfer be to build up the equipment of the transferee or to pension its employees. ... The argument is that, since the railroads and the public have a common interest in the efficient performance of the whole transportation chain, it is proper and necessary to require all carriers to contribute to the cost of a plan designed to serve this end. It is said that the pooling principle is desirable because there are many small carriers whose employees are too few to justify maintenance of a separate retirement plan for each.' In support of that view, several cases had been cited. Those cases were reviewed and distinguished, and we concluded (\n295 \nU.S. 330\n, at page 360, 55 S.Ct. 758, 767) 'that the provisions of the act which disregard the private and separate ownership of the several respondents, treast them all as a single employer, and pool all their assets, regardless of their individual obligations and the varying conditions found in their respective enterprises, cannot be justified as consistent with due process.'\n Cases which are relied upon here to sustain the Alabama statute were relied upon there to sustain the Retirement Act, Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642, among others. That case dealt with the State of Washington Workmen's Compensation Act, requiring designated payments to be made by employers into a state fund for compensating injured workmen. But we pointed out ( \n295 \nU.S. 330, 359\n, 55 S.Ct. 758, 767) that although the payments were made into a common fund, accounts were to be kept with each industry in accordance with the classification, and no class was to be liable for the depletion of the fund by reason of accidents happening in another class. And we said: 'The Railroad Retirement Act, on the contrary, makes no classification, but, as above said, treats all the carriers as a single employer, irrespective of their several conditions.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 530]\n\u00a0\n If the Alabama act had followed the plan of the Washington act in respect of classification, we should have a very different question to consider. The vice of the Alabama act is precisely that which was condemned in the Railroad Retirement Board Case. Indeed, the vice is more pronounced, since the federal act, relating as it did to railroads only, dealt with a homogeneous group of employers, while the Alabama act seeks to impose the character of 'a single employer' upon a large number of employers severally engaged in entirely dissimilar industries.\n It must be borne in mind that we are not dealing with a general tax, the proceeds of which are to be appropriated for any public purpose which the legislature thereafter may select, but with a tax expressly levied for a specified purpose. The tax and the use of the tax are inseparably united; and if the proposed use contravenes the Constitution, it necessarily follows that the tax does the same. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 764, 81 L.Ed. --, May 3, 1937.\n Other states have not found it impossible to adjust their unemployment laws to meet the constitutional difficulties thus presented by the Alabama act. The pioneer among these states is Wisconsin. That state provides (Act of January 28, 1932, c. 20, Laws of Wisc., Spec.Sess., 1931, p. 57, as amended) that while the proceeds of the tax shall be paid into a common fund, an account shall be kept with each individual employer, to which account his payments are to be credited and against which only the amounts paid to his former employees are to be charged. If he maintains his roll of employees intact, he will be charged nothing, and in any event only to the extent that his employment roll is diminished. When his tax contributions have reached a certain percentage of his pay roll, the amount of his tax is reduced, and when they reach 10 per cent., the tax is discontinued as long as that percentage remains. The result is that each employer \n\n[301 \nU.S. 495, 531]\n\u00a0\n bears his own burdens, and not those of his competitor or of other employers. The difference between the Wisconsin and the Alabama acts is thus succinctly stated by the Social Security Board in its Informational Service Circular No. 5, issued November, 1936, pp. 8, 9: '(1) The plan for individual employer accounts provides for employer-reserve accounts in the State fund. Each employer's contributions are credited to his separate account, and benefits are paid from his account only to his former employees. If he is able to build up a specified reserve in his account, his contribution rate is reduced.' Such is the Wisconsin plan; while under the Alabama statute: '(2) The pooled-fund plan provides for a pooling of all contributions in a single undivided fund from which benefits are paid to eligible employees, irrespective of their former employers.'\n Which of these plans is more advantageous from a purely economic standpoint does not present a judicial question. But from the constitutional point of view, in so far as it involves the ground upon which I think the Alabama act should be condemned, I entertain no doubt that the Wisconsin plan is so fair, reasonable and just as to make plain its constitutional validity; and that the Alabama statute, like the New York statute involved in Chamberlin, Inc., v. Andrews et al., \n299 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 122, 81 L.Ed. --, affirmed by an equally-divided court during the present term, is so arbitrary as to result in a denial both of due process and equal protection of the laws.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See section 2(g).

From 1927 to 1935, the trend has been downward, the rate of decline having been practically constant since 1928 forward, with the single exception in 1934.

(Last figure estimated at the trial by Gist, formerly statistician of the Department of Agriculture, and since Feb. 1, 1936, economic adviser to the Commissioner of Agriculture of Alabama.)

An important question of constitutional law being involved, we granted certiorari. \n300 \nU.S. 652\n, 57 S.Ct. 673, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 574]\n\u00a0\n The Social Security Act (Act of August 14, 1935, c. 531, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C., c. 7 (Supp.II), 42 U.S.C.A.  301-1305) is divided into eleven separate titles, of which only titles IX and III are so related to this case as to stand in need of summary.\n The caption of title IX is 'Tax on Employers of Eight or More.' Every employer (with stated exceptions) is to pay for each calendar year 'an excise tax, with respect to having individuals in his employ,' the tax to be measured by prescribed percentages of the total wages payable by the employer during the calendar year with respect to such employment. Section 901, 42 U.S.C.A.  1101. One is not, however, an 'employer' within the meaning of the act unless he employs eight persons or more. Section 907(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1107(a). There are also other limitations of minor importance. The term 'employment' too has its special definition, excluding agricultural labor, domestic service in a private home, and some other smaller classes. Section 907(c), 42 U.S.C.A.  1107(c). The tax begins with the year 1936, and is payable for the first time on January 31, 1937. During the calendar year 1936 the rate is to be 1 per cent., during 1937 2 per cent., and 3 per cent. thereafter. The proceeds, when collected, go into the Treasury of the United States like internal revenue collections generally. Section 905(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1105(a). They are not earmarked in any way. In certain circumstances, however, credits are allowable. Section 902, 42 U.S.C.A.  1102. If the taxpayer has made contributions to an unemployment fund under a state law, he may credit such contributions against the federal tax, provided, however, that the total credit allowed to any taxpayer shall not exceed 90 per centum of the tax against which it is credited, and provided also that the state law shall have been certified to the Secretary of the Treasury by the Social Security Board as satisfying certain minimum criteria. Section 902. The provisions of section 903 (42 U.S.C.A.  1103) defining those criteria are stated in the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 575]\n\u00a0\n margin. \n1\n Some of the conditions thus attached to the allowance of a credit are designed to give assurance that the state unemployment compensation law shall be one in substance as well as name. Others are designed to give assurance that the contributions shall be protected against loss after payment to the state. To this last end there \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 576]\n\u00a0\n are provisions that before a state law shall have the approval of the Board it must direct that the contributions to the state fund be paid over immediately to the Secretary of the Treasury to the credit of the 'Unemployment Trust Fund.' Section 904 (42 U.S.C.A.  1104) establishing this fund is quoted below. \n2\n For the moment it is enough to say that the fund is to be held by the Secretary of the Treasury, who is to invest in government securities any portion not required in his judgment to meet current withdrawals. He is authorized and directed to pay out of the fund to any competent state agency such sums as it may duly requisition from the amount standing to its credit. Section 904(f), 42 U.S.C.A.  1104(f). \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 577]\n\u00a0\n Title III, which is also challenged as invalid, has the caption 'Grants to States for Unemployment Compensation Administration.' Under this title, certain sums of money are 'authorized to be appropriated' for the purpose of assisting the states in the administration of their unemployment compensation laws, the maximum for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1936, to be $4,000,000, and $49,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter. Section 301, 42 U.S.C.A.  501. No present appropriation is made to the extent of a single dollar. All that the title does is to authorize future appropriations. Actually only $2,250,000 of the $4,000, 000 authorized was appropriated for 1936 (Act of Feb. 11, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 578]\n\u00a0\n 1936, c. 49, 49 Stat. 1109, 1113) and only $29,000,000 of the $49,000,000 authorized for the following year (Act of June 22, 1936, c. 689, 49 Stat. 1597, 1605). The appropriations when made were not specifically out of the proceeds of the employment tax, but out of any moneys in the Treasury. Other sections of the title prescribe the method by which the payments are to be made to the state (section 302, 42 U.S.C.A.  502) and also certain conditions to be established to the satisfaction of the Social Security Board before certifying the propriety of a payment to the Secretary of the Treasury (section 303, 42 U.S.C.A.  503). They are designed to give assurance to the federal government that the moneys granted by it will not be expended for purposes alien to the grant, and will be used in the administration of genuine unemployment compensation laws.\n The assault on the statute proceeds on an extended front. Its assailants take the ground that the tax is not an excise; that it is not uniform throughout the United States as excises are required to be; that its exceptions are so many and arbitrary as to violate the Fifth Amendment; that its purpose was not revenue, but an unlawful invasion of the reserved powers of the states; and that the states in submitting to it have yielded to coercion and have abandoned governmental functions which they are not permitted to surrender.\n The objections will be considered seriatim with such further explanation as may be necessary to make their meaning clear.\n First: The tax, which is described in the statute as an excise, is laid with uniformity throughout the United States as a duty, an impost, or an excise upon the relation of employment.\n\n 1. \nWe are told that the relation of employment is one so essential to the pursuit of happiness that it may not be burdened with a tax. Appeal is made to history. From the precedents of colonial days, we are supplied with \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 579]\n\u00a0\n illustrations of excises common in the colonies. They are said to have been bound up with the enjoyment of particular commodities. Appeal is also made to principle or the analysis of concepts. An excise, we are told, imports a tax upon a privilege; employment, it is said, is a right, not a privilege, from which it follows that employment is not subject to an excise. Neither the one appeal nor the other leads to the desired goal.\n As to the argument from history: Doubtless there were many excises in colonial days and later that were associated, more or less intimately, with the enjoyment or the use of property. This would not prove, even if no others were then known, that the forms then accepted were not subject to enlargement. Cf. Pensacola Teleg. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n96 \nU.S. 1\n, 9; In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 591\n, 15 S.Ct. 900; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 448\n, 449 S., 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737. But in truth other excises were known, and known since early times. Thus in 1695 (6 & 7 Wm. III, c. 6), Parliament passed an act which granted 'to His Majesty certain Rates and Duties upon Marriages, Births and Burials,' all for the purpose of 'carrying on the War against France with Vigour.' See Opinion of the Justices, 196 Mass. 603, 609, 85 N.E. 545, 547. No commodity was affected there. The industry of counsel has supplied us with an apter illustration where the tax was not different in substance from the one now challenged as invalid. In 1777, before our Constitutional Convention, Parliament laid upon employers an annual 'duty' of 21 shillings for 'every male Servant' employed in stated forms of work. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 580]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1777, 17 George III, c. 39.4 The point is made as a distinction that a tax upon the use of male servants was thought of as a tax upon a luxury. Davis v. Boston & Maine R.R. Co., supra. It did not touch employments in husbandry or business. This is to throw over the argument that historically an excise is a tax upon the enjoyment of commodities. But the attempted distinction, whatever may be thought of its validity, is inapplicable to a statute of Virginia passed in 1780. There a tax of 3 pounds, 6 shillings, and 8 pence was to be paid for every male tithable above the age of twenty-one years (with stated exceptions), and a like tax for 'every white servant whatsoever, except apprentices under the age of twenty one years.' 10 Hening's Statutes of Virginia, p. 244. Our colonial forbears knew more about ways of taxing than some of their descendants seem to be willing to concede. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The historical prop failing, the prop or fancied prop of principle remains. We learn that employment for lawful gain is a 'natural' or 'inherent' or 'inalienable' right, and not a 'privilege' at all. But natural rights, so called, are as much subject to taxation as rights of less importance. \n6\n An excise is not limited to vocations or activities \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 581]\n\u00a0\n that may be prohibited altogether. It is not limited to those that are the outcome of a franchise. It extends to vocations or activities pursued as of common right. What the individual does in the operation of a business is amenable to taxation just as much as what he owns, at all events if the classification is not tyrannical or arbitrary. 'Business is as legitimate an object of the taxing power as property.' City of Newton v. Atchison, 31 Kan. 151, 154, 1 P. 288, 290, 47 Am.Rep. 486 (per Brewer, J.). Indeed, ownership itself, as we had occasion to point out the other day, is only a bundle of rights and privileges invested with a single name. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., Inc. (March 29, 1937) \n300 \nU.S. 577\n, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527. 'A state is at liberty, if it pleases, to tax them all collectively, or to separate the faggots and lay the charge distributively.' Id. Employment is a business relation, if not itself a business. It is a relation without which business could seldom be carried on effectively. The power to tax the activities and relations that constitute a calling considered as a unit is the power to tax any of them. The whole includes the parts. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 267\n, 268 S., 53 S.Ct. 345, 349, 350, 87 A.L.R. 1191\n\n\n The subject-matter of taxation open to the power of the Congress is as comprehensive as that open to the power of the states, though the method of apportionment may at times be different. 'The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.' Article 1,  8. If the tax is a direct one, it shall be apportioned according to the census or enumeration. If it is a duty, impost, or excise, it shall be uniform throughout the United States. Together, these classes include every form of tax appropriate to sovereignty. Cf. Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 \nU.S. 378, 403\n, 405 S., 53 S.Ct. 457, 464, 465, 86 A.L.R. 747; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas.1917B, 713. Whether the tax is to be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 582]\n\u00a0\n classified as an 'excise' is in truth not of critical importance. If not that, it is an 'impost' (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 622\n, 625 S., 15 S.Ct. 912; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 445), or a 'duty' (Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 546, 547; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 570\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 46\n, 20 S.Ct. 747). A capitation or other 'direct' tax it certainly is not. 'Although there have been, from time to time, intimations that there might be some tax which was not a direct tax, nor included under the words 'duties, imposts, and excises,' such a tax, for more than 100 years of national existence, has as yet remained undiscovered, notwithstanding the stress of particular circumstances has invited thorough investigation into sources of revenue.' Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 557\n, 15 S.Ct. 673, 680. There is no departure from that thought in later cases, but rather a new emphasis of it. Thus, in Thomas v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 24 S.Ct. 305, 306, it was said of the words 'duties, imposts, and excises' that 'they were used comprehensively to cover customs and excise duties imposed on importation, consumption, manufacture, and sale of certain commodities, privileges, particular business transactions, vocations, occupations, and the like.' At times taxpayers have contended that the Congress is without power to lay an excise on the enjoyment of a privilege created by state law. The contention has been put aside as baseless. Congress may tax the transmission of property by inheritance or will, though the states and not Congress have created the privilege of succession. Knowlton v. Moore, supra, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, at page 58, 20 S.Ct. 747. Congress may tax the enjoyment of a corporate franchise, though a state and not Congress has brought the franchise into being. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 108\n, 155 S., 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312. The statute books of the states are strewn with illustrations of taxes laid on \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 583]\n\u00a0\n occupations pursued of common right. \n7\n We find no basis for a holding that the power in that regard which belongs by accepted practice to the Legislatures of the states, has been denied by the Constitution to the Congress of the nation.\n\n 2. \nThe tax being an excise, its imposition must conform to the canon of uniformity. There has been no departure from this requirement. According to the settled doctrine, the uniformity exacted is geographical, not intrinsic. Knowlton v. Moore, supra, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, at page 83, 20 S.Ct. 747; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, at page 158, 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S.Ct. 421; Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 613\n, 38 S.Ct. 215; LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 392\n, 41 S.Ct. 528, 532; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 117\n, 51 S.Ct. 58, 61; Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank (March 29, 1937) \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, 57 S. Ct. 556. 'The rule of liability shall be alike in all parts of the United States.' Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S.Ct. 265, 266.\n Second: The excise is not invalid under the provisions of the Fifth Amendment by force of its exemptions. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 584]\n\u00a0\n The statute does not apply, as we have seen, to employers of less then eight. It does not apply to agricultural labor, or domestic service in a private home or to some other classes of less importance. Petitioner contends that the effect of these restrictions is an arbitrary discrimination vitiating the tax.\n The Fifth Amendment unlike the Fourteenth has no equal protection clause. LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, supra; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., supra, \n240 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 24, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas.1917B, 713. But even the states, though subject to such a clause, are not confined to a formula of rigid uniformity in framing measures of taxation. Swiss Oil Corporation v. Shanks, \n273 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 47 S.Ct. 393, 395. They may tax some kinds of property at one rate, and others at another, and exempt others altogether. Bell's Gap R.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232\n, 10 S. Ct. 533; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 426, 44 A.L.R. 1454; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 50 S.Ct. 310. They may lay an excise on the operations of a particular kind of business, and exempt some other kind of business closely akin thereto. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 94\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 26 S.Ct. 232; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 573\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 255\n, 43 S.Ct. 83, 84; State Board of Tax Com'rs v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 537\n, 538 S., 51 S.Ct. 540, 543, 73 A.L. R. 1464, 75 A.L.R. 1536. If this latitude of judgment is lawful for the states, it is lawful, a fortiori, in legislation by the Congress, which is subject to restraints less narrow and confining. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra.\n The classifications and exemptions directed by the statute now in controversy have support in considerations of policy and practical convenience that cannot be condemned as arbitrary. The classifications and exemptions would therefore be upheld if they had been adopted by a state and the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment were invoked to annul them. This is held in two cases \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 585]\n\u00a0\n passed upon today in which precisely the same provisions were the subject of attack, the provisions being contained in the Unemployment Compensation Law of the state of Alabama (Gen.Acts Ala.1935, p. 950, as amended). Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co. (Carmichael v. Gulf States Paper Corporation), \n301 \nU.S. 495\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 81 L.Ed. --. The opinion rendered in those cases covers the ground fully. It would be useless to repeat the argument. The act of Congress is therefore valid, so far at least as its system of exemptions is concerned, and this though we assume that discrimination, if gross enough, is equivalent to confiscation and subject under the Fifth Amendment to challenge and annulment.\n Third: The excise is not void as involving the coercion of the states in contravention of the Tenth Amendment or of restrictions implicit in our federal form of government.\n The proceeds of the excise when collected are paid into the Treasury at Washington, and thereafter are subject to appropriation like public moneys generally. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States (May 3, 1937) \n301 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 764, 81 L.Ed. --. No presumption can be indulged that they will be misapplied or wasted. \n8\n Even if they were collected in the hope or expectation that some other and collateral good would be furthered as an incident, that without more would not make the act invalid. Sonzinsky v. United States (March 29, 1937) \n300 \nU.S. 506\n, 57 S.Ct. 554, 555. This indeed is hardly questioned. The case for the petitioner is built on the contention that here an ulterior aim is wrought into the very structure of the act, and what is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 586]\n\u00a0\n even more important that the aim is not only ulterior, but essentially unlawful. In particular, the 90 per cent. credit is relied upon as supporting that conclusion. But before the statute succumbs to an assault upon these lines, two propositions must be made out by the assailant. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra. There must be a showing in the first place that separated from the credit the revenue provisions are incapable of standing by themselves. There must be a showing in the second place that the tax and the credit in combination are weapons of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states. The truth of each proposition being essential to the success of the assault, we pass for convenience to a consideration of the second, without pausing to inquire whether there has been a demonstration of the first.\n To draw the line intelligently between duress and inducement, there is need to remind ourselves of facts as to the problem of unemployment that are now matters of common knowledge. West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ( March 29, 1937) \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578. The relevant statistics are gathered in the brief of counsel for the government. Of the many available figures a few only will be mentioned. During the years 1929 to 1936, when the country was passing through a cyclical depression, the number of the unemployed mounted to unprecedented heights. Often the average was more than 10 million; at times a peak was attained of 16 million or more. Disaster to the breadwinner meant disaster to dependents. Accordingly the roll of the unemployed, itself formidable enough, was only a partial roll of the destitute or needy. The fact developed quickly that the states were unable to give the requisite relief. The problem had become national in area and dimensions. There was need of help from the nation if the people were not to starve. It is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that in a crisis so extreme the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 587]\n\u00a0\n and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the general welfare. Cf. United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1, 65\n, 66 S., 56 S.Ct. 312, 319, 102 A.L.R. 914; Helvering v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 619, 672\n, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. --, decided herewith. The nation responded to the call of the distressed. Between January 1, 1933, and July 1, 1936, the states (according to statistics submitted by the government) incurred obligations of $689,291,802 for emergency relief; local subdivisions an additional $775,675,366. In the same period the obligations for emergency relief incurred by the national government were $ 2,929,307,125, or twice the obligations of states and local agencies combined. According to the President's budget message for the fiscal year 1938, the national government expended for public works and unemployment relief for the three fiscal years 1934, 1935, and 1936, the stupendous total of $8,681,000,000. The parens patriae has many reasons-fiscal and economic as well as social and moral-for planning to mitigate disasters that bring these burdens in their train.\n In the presence of this urgent need for some remedial expedient, the question is to be answered whether the expedient adopted has overlept the bounds of power. The assailants of the statute say that its dominant end and aim is to drive the state Legislatures under the whip of economic pressure into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws at the bidding of the central government. Supporters of the statute say that its operation is not constraint, but the creation of a larger freedom, the states and the nation joining in a co-operative endeavor to avert a common evil. Before Congress acted, unemployment compensation insurance was still, for the most part, a project and no more. Wisconsin was the pioneer. Her statute was adopted in 1931. At times bills for such insurance were introduced elsewhere, but they did not reach the stage of law. In 1935, four states (California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York) passed unem- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 588]\n\u00a0\n ployment laws on the eve of the adoption of the Social Security Act, and two others did likewise after the federal act and later in the year. The statutes differed to some extent in type, but were directed to a common end. In 1936, twenty-eight other states fell in line, and eight more the present year. But if states had been holding back before the passage of the federal law, inaction was not owing, for the most part, to the lack of sympathetic interest. Many held back through alarm lest in laying such a toll upon their industries, they would place themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors. See House Report, No. 615, 74th Congress, 1st session, p. 8; Senate Report, No. 628, 74th Congress, 1st session, p. 11.9 Two consequences ensued. One was that the freedom of a state to contribute its fair share to the solution of a national problem was paralyzed by fear. The other was that in so far as there was failure by the states to contribute relief according to the measure of their capacity, a disproportionate burden, and a mountainous one, was laid upon the resources of the government of the nation.\n The Social Security Act is an attempt to find a method by which all these public agencies may work together to a common end. Every dollar of the new taxes will continue in all likelihood to be used and needed by the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 589]\n\u00a0\n nation as long as states are unwilling, whether through timidity or for other motives, to do what can be done at home. At least the inference is permissible that Congress so believed, though retaining undiminished freedom to spend the money as it pleased. On the other hand, fulfillment of the home duty will be lightened and encouraged by crediting the taxpayer upon his account with the Treasury of the nation to the extent that his contributions under the laws of the locality have simplified or diminished the problem of relief and the probable demand upon the resources of the fisc. Duplicated taxes, or burdens that approach them are recognized hardships that government, state or national, may properly avoid. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., Inc., supra; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 125\n, 41 S.Ct. 43, 44. If Congress believed that the general welfare would better be promoted by relief through local units than by the system then in vogue, the co-operating localities ought not in all fairness to pay a second time.\n Who then is coerced through the operation of this statute? Not the taxpayer. He pays in fulfillment of the mandate of the local legislature. Not the state. Even now she does not offer a suggestion that in passing the unemployment law she was affected by duress. See Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co. (Carmichael v. Gulf States Paper Corporation), supra. For all that appears, she is satisfied with her choice, and would be sorely disappointed if it were now to be annulled. The difficulty with the petitioner's contention is that it confuses motive with coercion. 'Every tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.' Sonzinsky v. United States, supra. In like manner every rebate from a tax when conditioned upon conduct is in some measure a temptation. But to hold that motive \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 590]\n\u00a0\n or temptation is equivalent to coercion is to plunge the law in endless difficulties. The outcome of such a doctrine is the acceptance of a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes impossible. Till now the law has been guided by a robust common sense which assumes the freedom of the will as a working hypothesis in the solution of its problems. The wisdom of the hypothesis has illustration in this case. Nothing in the case suggests the exertion of a power akin to undue influence, if we assume that such a concept can ever be applied with fitness to the relations between state and nation. Even on that assumption the location of the point at which pressure turns into compulsion, and ceases to be inducement, would be a question of degree, at times, perhaps, of fact. The point had not been reached when Alabama made her choice. We cannot say that she was acting, not of her unfettered will, but under the strain of a persuasion equivalent to undue influence, when she chose to have relief administered under laws of her own making, by agents of her own selection, instead of under federal laws, administered by federal officers, with all the ensuing evils, at least to many minds, of federal patronage and power. There would be a strange irony, indeed, if her choice were now to be annulled on the basis of an assumed duress in the enactment of a statute which her courts have accepted as a true expression of her will. Beeland Wholesale Co. v. Kaufman, supra. We think the choice must stand.\n In ruling as we do, we leave many questions open. We do not say that a tax is valid, when imposed by act of Congress, if it is laid upon the condition that a state may escape its operation through the adoption of a statute unrelated in subject-matter to activities fairly within the scope of national policy and power. No such question is before us. In the tender of this credit Congress does not intrude upon fields foreign to its function. The purpose \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 591]\n\u00a0\n of its intervention, as we have shown, is to safeguard its own treasury and as an incident to that protection to place the states upon a footing of equal opportunity. Drains upon its own resources are to be checked; obstructions to the freedom of the states are to be leveled. It is one thing to impose a tax dependent upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. The Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432, and Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44\n, 42 S.Ct. 453, were decided in the belief that the statutes there condemned were exposed to that reproach. Cf. United States v. Constantine, \n296 \nU.S. 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 223. It is quite another thing to say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power. We do not fix the outermost line. Enough for present purposes that wherever the line may be, this statute is within it. Definition more precise must abide the wisdom of the future.\n Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 265, supplies us with a precedent, if precedent be needed. What was in controversy there was section 301 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 69), which imposes a tax upon the transfer of a decedent's estate, while at the same time permitting a credit, not exceeding 80 per cent., for 'the amount of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any State or Territory.' Florida challenged that provision as unlawful. Florida had no inheritance taxes and alleged that under its constitution it could not levy any. \n273 \nU.S. 12, 15\n, 47 S.Ct. 265. Indeed, by abolishing inheritance taxes, it had hoped to induce wealthy persons to become its citizens. See 67 Cong. Rec., Part 1, pp. 735, 752. It argued at our bar that 'the Estate Tax provision was not passed for the purpose \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 592]\n\u00a0\n of raising federal revenue' (\n273 \nU.S. 12, 14\n, 47 S.Ct. 265), but rather 'to coerce States into adopting estate or inheritance tax laws' ( \n273 \nU.S. 12, 13\n, 47 S.Ct. 265). In fact, as a result of the 80 per cent. credit, material changes of such laws were made in thirty-six states. \n10\n In the face of that attack we upheld the act as valid. Cf. Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 482\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, 599; also Act of August 5, 1861, c. 45, 12 Stat. 292; Act of May 13, 1862, c. 66, 12 Stat. 384.\n United States v. Butler, supra, is cited by petitioner as a decision to the contrary. There a tax was imposed on processors of farm products, the proceeds to be paid to farmers who would reduce their acreage and crops under agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture, the plan of the act being to increase the prices of certain farm products by decreasing the quantities produced. The court held (1) that the socalled tax was not a true one (\n297 \nU.S. 1\n, at pages 56, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 315, 317, 102 A.L.R. 914), the proceeds being earmarked for the benefit of farmers complying with the prescribed conditions, (2) that there was an attempt to regulate production without the consent of the state in which production was affected, and (3) that the payments to farmers were coupled with coercive contracts (\n297 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 73, 56 S.Ct. 312, 322, 102 A.L.R. 914), unlawful in their aim and oppressive in their consequences. The decision was by a a divided court, a minority taking the view that the objections were untenable. None of them is applicable to the situation here developed.\n\n\n (a)\n The proceeds of the tax in controversy are not earmarked for a special group.\n\n\n (b)\n The unemployment compensation law which is a condition of the credit has had the approval of the state and could not be a law without it.\n\n\n (c)\n The condition is not linked to an irrevocable agreement, for the state at its pleasure may repeal its unemployment law (section 903(a)(6), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a)(6), terminate the credit, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 593]\n\u00a0\n and place itself where it was before the credit was accepted.\n\n\n (d)\n The condition is not directed to the attainment of an unlawful end, but to an end, the relief of unemployment, for which nation and state may lawfully coo perate.\n Fourth: The statute does not call for a surrender by the states of powers essential to their quasi sovereign existence.\n Argument to the contrary has its source in two sections of the act. One section (90311) defines the minimum criteria to which a state compensation system is required to conform if it is to be accepted by the Board as the basis for a credit. The other section (90412) rounds out the requirement with complementary rights and duties. Not all the criteria or their incidents are challenged as unlawful. We will speak of them first generally, and then more specifically in so far as they are questioned.\n A credit to taxpayers for payments made to a state under a state unemployment law will be manifestly futile in the absence of some assurance that the law leading to the credit is in truth what it professes to be. An unemployment law framed in such a way that the unemployed who look to it will be deprived of reasonable protection is one in name and nothing more. What is basic and essential may be assured by suitable conditions. The terms embodied in these sections are directed to that end. A wide range of judgment is given to the several states as to the particular type of statute to be spread upon their books. For anything to the contrary in the provisions of this act they may use the pooled unemployment form, which is in effect with variations in Alabama, California, Michigan, New York, and elsewhere. They may establish a system of merit ratings applicable at \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 594]\n\u00a0\n once or to go into effect later on the basis of subsequent experience. Cf. Sections 909, 910, 42 U.S.C.A.  1109, 1110. They may provide for employee contributions as in Alabama and California, or put the entire burden upon the employer as in New York. They may choose a system of unemployment reserve accounts by which an employer is permitted after his reserve has accumulated to contribute at a reduced rate or even not at all. This is the system which had its origin in Wisconsin. What they may not do, if they would earn the credit, is to depart from those standards which in the judgment of Congress are to be ranked as fundamental. Even if opinion may differ as to the fundamental quality of one or more of the conditions, the difference will not avail to vitiate the statute. In determining essentials, Congress must have the benefit of a fair margin of discretion. One cannot say with reason that this margin has been exceeded, or that the basic standards have been determined in any arbitrary fashion. In the event that some particular condition shall be found to be too uncertain to be capable of enforcement, it may be severed from the others, and what is left will still be valid.\n We are to keep in mind steadily that the conditions to be approved by the Board as the basis for a credit are not provisions of a contract, but terms of a statute, which may be altered or repealed. Section 903(a)(6). The state does not bind itself to keep the law in force. It does not even bind itself that the moneys paid into the federal fund will be kept there indefinitely or for any stated time. On the contrary, the Secretary of the Treasury will honor a requisition for the whole or any part of the deposit in the fund whenever one is made by the appropriate officials. The only consequence of the repeal or excessive amendment of the statute, or the expenditure of the money, when requisitioned, for other than compensation uses or administrative expenses, is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 595]\n\u00a0\n that approval of the law will end, and with it the allowance of a credit, upon notice to the state agency and an opportunity for hearing. Section 903(b, c), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(b, c).\n These basic considerations are in truth a solvent of the problem. Subjected to their test, the several objections on the score of abdication are found to be unreal.\n Thus, the argument is made that by force of an agreement the moneys when withdrawn must be 'paid through public employment offices in the State or such other agencies as the Board may approve.' Section 903(a)(1), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a)(1). But in truth there is no agreement as to the method of disbursement. There is only a condition which the state is free at pleasure to disregard or to fulfill. Moreover, approval is not requisite if public employment offices are made the disbursing instruments. Approval is to be a check upon resort to 'other agencies' that may perchance, be irresponsible. A state looking for a credit must give assurance that her system has been organized upon a base of rationality.\n There is argument again that the moneys when withdrawn are to be devoted to specific uses, the relief of unemployment, and that by agreement for such payment the quasi-sovereign position of the state has been impaired, if not abandoned. But again there is confusion between promise and condition. Alabama is still free, without breach of an agreement to change her system over night. No officer or agency of the national government can force a compensation law upon her or keep it in existence. No officer or agency of that government, either by suit or other means, can supervise or control the application of the payments.\n Finally and chiefly, abdication is supposed to follow from section 904 of the statute and the parts of section 903 that are complementary thereto. Section 903(a)(3). By these the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive and hold in the Unemployment Trust Fund all \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 596]\n\u00a0\n moneys deposited therein by a state agency for a state unemployment fund and to invest in obligations of the United States such portion of the fund as is not in his judgment required to meet current withdrawals. We are told that Alabama in consenting to that deposit has renounced the plenitude of power inherent in her statehood.\n The same pervasive misconception is in evidence again. All that the state has done is to say in effect through the enactment of a statute that her agents shall be authorized to deposit the unemployment tax receipts in the Treasury at Washington. Alabama Unemployment Act of September 14, 1935, section 10(i) (Gen.Acts Ala.1935, p. 961). The statute may be repealed. Section 903(a)(6), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a)(6). The consent may be revoked. The deposits may be withdrawn. The moment the state commission gives notice to the depositary that it would like the moneys back, the Treasurer will return them. To find state destruction there is to find it almost anywhere. With nearly as much reason one might say that a state abdicates its functions when it places the state moneys on deposit in a national bank.\n There are very good reasons of fiscal and governmental policy why a state should be willing to make the Secretary of the Treasury the custodian of the fund. His possession of the moneys and his control of investments will be an assurance of stability and safety in times of stress and strain. A report of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives, quoted in the margin, develops the situation clearly. 13 Nor is there risk of loss \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 597]\n\u00a0\n or waste. The credit of the Treasury is at all times back of the deposit, with the result that the right of withdrawal will be unaffected by the fate of any intermediate investments, just as if a checking account in the usual form had been opened in a bank.\n The inference of abdication thus dissolves in thinnest air when the deposit is conceived of as dependent upon a statutory consent, and not upon a contract effective to create a duty. By this we do not intimate that the conclusion would be different if a contract were discovered. Even sovereigns may contract without derogating from their sovereignty. Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 353\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 436, 95 A.L.R. 1335; 1 Oppenheim, International Law (4th Ed.)  493, 494; Hall, International Law (8th Ed.)  107; 2 Hyde, International Law,  489. The states are at liberty, upon obtaining the consent of Congress, to make agreements with one another. Constitution, art. 1,  10, par. 3. Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Pet. 185, 209; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 725. We find no room for doubt that they may do the like with Congress if the essence of their statehood is maintained without impairment. \n14\n Alabama \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 598]\n\u00a0\n is seeking and obtaining a credit of many millions in favor of her citizens out of the Treasury of the nation. Nowhere in our scheme of government-in the limitations express or implied of our Federal Constitution-do we find that she is prohibited from assenting to conditions that will assure a fair and just requital for benefits received. But we will not labor the point further. An unreal prohibition directed to an unreal agreement will not vitiate an act of Congress, and cause it to collapse in ruin.\n Fifth: Title III of the act is separable from title IX, and its validity is not at issue.\n The essential provisions of that title have been stated in the opinion. As already pointed out, the title does not appropriate a dollar of the public moneys. It does no more than authorize appropriations to be made in the future for the purpose of assisting states in the administration of their laws, if Congress shall decide that appropriations are desirable. The title might be expunged, and title IX would stand intact. Without a severability clause we should still be led to that conclusion. The presence of such a clause (section 1103, 42 U.S.C.A.  1303) makes the conclusion even clearer. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 117, 60 A.L.R. 596; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 52 S.Ct. 548, 553; Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 312\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, 873.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n That portion of the Social Security legislation here under consideration, I think, exceeds the power granted to Congress. It unduly interferes with the orderly government of the state by her own people and otherwise offends the Federal Constitution.\n In Texas v. White (1869) 7 Wall. 700, 725, a cause of momentous importance, this Court, through Chief Justice Chase, declared- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 599]\n\u00a0\n 'But the perpetuity and indissolubility of the Union, by no means implies the loss of distinct and individual existence, or of the right of self-government by the States. Under the Articles of Confederation each State retained its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right not expressly delegated to the United States. Under the Constitution, though the powers of the States were much restricted, still, all powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. And we have already had occasion to remark at this term, that 'the people of each State compose a State, having its own government, and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence,' and that 'without the States in union, there could be no such political body as the United States.' (Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76). Not only, therefore, can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States, through their union under the Constitution, but it may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National Government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.'\n The doctrine thus announced and often repeated, I had supposed was firmly established. Apparently the states remained really free to exercise governmental powers, not delegated or prohibited, without interference by the federal government through threats of punitive measures or offers of seductive favors. Unfortunately, the decision just announced opens the way for practical annihilation of this theory; and no cloud of words or ostentatious parade of irrelevant statistics should be permitted to obscure that fact. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 600]\n\u00a0\n The invalidity also the destructive tendency of legislation like the act before us were forecefully pointed out by President Franklin Pierce in a veto message sent to the Senate May 3, 1854.1 He was a scholarly lawyer of distinction and enjoyed the advice and counsel of a rarely able Attorney General-Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts. This message considers with unusual lucidity points here specially important. I venture to set out pertinent portions of it which must appeal to all who continue to respect both the letter and spirit of our great charter.\n'To the Senate of the United States:\n\n'The bill entitled 'An Act making a grant of public lands to the several States for the benefit of indigent insane persons,' which was presented to me on the 27th ultimo, has been maturely considered, and is returned to the Senate, the House in which it originated, with a statement of the objections which have required me to withhold from it may approval . ...\n\n'If in presenting my objections to this bill I should say more than strictly belongs to the measure or is required for the discharge of my official obligation, let it be attributed to a sincere desire to justify my act before those whose good opinion I so highly value and to that earnestness which springs from my deliberate conviction that a strict adherence to the terms and purposes of the federal compact offers the best, if not the only, security for the preservation of our blessed inheritance of representative liberty.\n\n'The bill provides in substance:\n\n'First. That 10,000,000 acres of land be granted to the several States, to be apportioned among them in the compound ratio of the geographical area and representation of said States in the House of Representatives. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 601]\n\u00a0\n 'Second. That wherever there are public lands in a State subject to sale at the reguiar price of private entry, the proportion of said 10,000, 000 acres falling to such State shall be selected from such lands within it, and that to the States in which there are no such public lands land scrip shall be issued to the amount of their distributive shares, respectively, said scrip not to be entered by said States, but to be sold by them and subject to entry by their assignees: Provided, That none of it shall be sold at less than $1 per acre, under penalty of forfeiture of the same to the United States.\n\n'Third. That the expenses of the management and superintendence of said lands and of the moneys received therefrom shall be paid by the States to which they may belong out of the treasury of said States.\n\n'Fourth. That the gross proceeds of the sales of such lands or land scrip so granted shall be invested by the several States in safe stocks, to constitute a perpetual fund, the principal of which shall remain forever undiminished, and the interest to be appropriated to the maintenance of the indigent insane within the several States.\n\n'Fifth. That annual returns of lands or scrip sold shall be made by the States to the Secretary of the Interior, and the whole grant be subject to certain conditions and limitations prescribed in the bill, to be assented to by legislative acts of said States.\n\n'This bill therefore proposes that the Federal Government shall make provision to the amount of the value of 10,000,000 acres of land for an eleemosynary object within the several States, to be administered by the political authority of the same; and it presents at the threshold the question whether any such act on the part of the Federal Government is warranted and sanctioned by the Constitution, the provisions and principles of which are to be protected and sustained as a first and paramount duty. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 602]\n\u00a0\n 'It can not be questioned that if Congress has power to make provision for the indigent insane without the limits of this District it has the same power to provide for the indigent who are not insane, and thus to transfer to the Federal Government the charge of all the poor in all the States. It has the same power to provide hospitals and other local establishments for the care and cure of every species of human infirmity, and thus to assume all that duty of either public philanthropy or public necessity to the dependent, the orphan, the sick, or the needy which is now discharged by the States themselves or by corporate institutions or private endowments existing under the legislation of the States. The whole field of public beneficence is thrown open to the care and culture of the Federal Government. Generous impulses no longer encounter the limitations and control of our imperious fundamental law; for however worthy may be the present object in itself, it is only one of a class. It is not exclusively worthy of benevolent regard. Whatever considerations dictate sympathy for this particular object apply in like manner, if not in the same degree, to idiocy, to physical disease, to extreme destitution. If Congress may and ought to provide for any one of these objects, it may and ought to provide for them all. And if it be done in this case, what answer shall be given when Congress shall be called upon, as it doubtless will be, to pursue a similar course of legislation in the others? It will obviously be vain to reply that the object is worthy, but that the application has taken a wrong direction. The power will have been deliberately assumed, the general obligation will by this act have been acknowledged, and the question of means and expediency will alone be left for consideration. The decision upon the principle in any one case determines it for the whole class. The question presented, therefore, clearly is upon the constitutionality and propriety of the Federal Gov- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 603]\n\u00a0\n ernment assuming to enter into a novel and vast field of legislation, namely, that of providing for the care and support of all those among the people of the United States who by any form of calamity become fit objects of public philanthropy.\n\n'I readily and, I trust, feelingly acknowledge the duty incumbent on us all as men and citizens, and as among the highest and holiest of our duties, to provide for those who, in the mysterious order of Providence, are subject to want and to disease of body or mind; but I can not find any authority in the Constitution for making the Federal Government the great almoner of public charity throughout the United States. To do so would, in my judgment, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and subversive of the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded. And if it were admissible to contemplate the exercise of this power for any object whatever, I can not avoid the belief that it would in the end be prejudicial rather than beneficial in the noble offices of charity to have the charge of them transferred from the States to the Federal Government. Are we not too prone to forget that the Federal Union is the creature of the States, not they of the Federal Union? We were the inhabitants of colonies distinct in local government one from the other before the Revolution. By the Revolution the colonies each became an independent State. They achieved that independence and secured its recognition by the agency of a consulting body, which, from being an assembly of the ministers of distinct sovereignties instructed to agree to no form of government which did not leave the domestic concerns of each State to itself, was appropriately denominated a Congress. When, having tried the experiment of the Confederation, they resolved to change that for the present Federal Union, and thus to confer on the Federal Government more ample authority, they scrupulously measured such of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 604]\n\u00a0\n functions of their cherished sovereignty as they chose to delegate to the General Government. With this aim and to this end the fathers of the Republic framed the Constitution, in and by which the independent and sovereign States united themselves for certain specified objects and purposes, and for those only, leaving all powers not therein set forth as conferred on one or another of the three great departments-the legislative, the executive, and the judicial-indubitably with the States. And when the people of the several States had in their State conventions, and thus alone, given effect and force to the Constitution, not content that any doubt should in future arise as to the scope and character of this act, they ingrafted thereon the explicit declaration that 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.'\n\n'Can it be controverted that the great mass of the business of Government-that involved in the social relations, the internal arrangements of the body politic, the mental and moral culture of men, the development of local resources of wealth, the punishment of crimes in general, the preservation of order, the relief of the needy or otherwise unfortunate members of society-did in practice remain with the States; that none of these objects of local concern are by the Constitution expressly or impliedly prohibited to the States, and that none of them are by any express language of the Constitution transferred to the United States? Can it be claimed that any of these functions of local administration and legislation are vested in the Federal Government by any implication? I have never found anything in the Constitution which is susceptible of such a construction. No one of the enumerated powers touches the subject or has even a remote analogy to it. The powers conferred upon the United States have reference to federal relations, or to the means of accom- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 605]\n\u00a0\n plishing or executing things of federal relation. So also of the same character are the powers taken away from the States by enumeration. In either case the powers granted and the powers restricted were so granted or so restricted only where it was requisite for the maintenance of peace and harmony between the States or for the purpose of protecting their common interests and defending their common sovereignty against aggression from abroad or insurrection at home.\n\n'I shall not discuss at length the question of power sometimes claimed for the General Government under the clause of the eighth section of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,' because if it has not already been settled upon sound reason and authority it never will be. I take the received and just construction of that article, as if written to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises in order to pay the debts and in order to provide for the common defense and general welfare. It is not a substantive general power to provide for the welfare of the United States, but is a limitation on the grant of power to raise money by taxes, duties, and imposts. If it were otherwise, all the rest of the Constitution, consisting of carefully enumerated and cautiously guarded grants of specific powers, would have been useless, if not delusive. It would be impossible in that view to escape from the conclusion that these were inserted only to mislead for the present, and, instead of enlightening and defining the pathway of the future, in involve its action in the mazes of doubtful construction. Such a conclusion the character of the men who framed that sacred instrument will never permit us to form. Indeed, to suppose it susceptible of any other construction would be to consign all the rights of the States and of the people of the States to the mere discre- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 606]\n\u00a0\n tion of Congress, and thus to clothe the Federal Government with authority to control the sovereign States, by which they would have been dwarfed into provinces or departments and all sovereignty vested in an absolute consolidated central power, against which the spirit of liberty has so often and in so many countries struggled in vain.\n\n'In my judgment you can not by tributes to humanity make any adequate compensation for the wrong you would inflict by removing the sources of power and political action from those who are to be thereby affected. If the time shall ever arrive when, for an object appealing, however strongly, to our sympathies, the dignity of the States shall bow to the dictation of Congress by conforming their legislation thereto, when the power and majesty and honor of those who created shall become subordinate to the thing of their creation, I but feebly utter my apprehensions when I express my firm conviction that we shall see 'the beginning of the end.'\n\n'Fortunately, we are not left in doubt as to the purpose of the Constitution any more than as to its express lauguage, for although the history of its formation, as recorded in the Madison Papers, shows that the Federal Government in its present form emerged from the conflict of opposing influences which have continued to divide statesmen from that day to this, yet the rule of clearly defined powers and of strict construction presided over the actual conclusion and subsequent adoption of the Constitution. President Madison, in the Federalist, says:\n\n\"The powers delegated to the proposed Constitution are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. ... Its (the General Government's) jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 607]\n\u00a0\n 'In the same spirit President Jefferson invokes 'the support of the State governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies;' and President Jackson said that our true strength and wisdom are not promoted by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States, but that, on the contrary, they consist 'not in binding the States more closely to the center, but in leaving each more unobstructed in its proper orbit.'\n\n'The framers of the Constitution, in refusing to confer on the Federal Government any jurisdiction over these purely local objects, in my judgment manifested a wise forecast and broad comprehension of the true interests of these objects themselves. It is clear that public charities Within the States can be efficiently administered only by their authority. The bill before me concedes this, for it does not commit the funds it provides to the administration of any other authority.\n\n'I can not but repeat what I have before expressed, that if the several States, many of which have already laid the foundation of munificent establishments of local beneficence, and nearly all of which are proceeding to establish them, shall be led to suppose, as, should this bill become a law, they will be, that Congress is to make provision for such objects the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several States instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their own people may themselves, through the strong temptation which appeals to states as to individuals, become humble suppliants for the bounty of the Federal Government, reversing their true relations to this Union. ...\n\n'I have been unable to discover any distinction on constitutional grounds or grounds of expediency between an appropriation of $10,000,000 directly from the money in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 608]\n\u00a0\n the Treasury for the object contemplated and the appropriation of lands presented for my sanction, and yet I can not doubt that if the bill proposed $10,000,000 from the Treasury of the United States for the support of the indigent insane in the several States that the constitutional question involved in the act would have attracted forcibly the attention of Congress.\n\n'I respectfully submit that in a constitutional point of view it is wholly immaterial whether the appropriation be in money or in land. ...\n\n'To assume that the public lands are applicable to ordinary State objects, whether of public structures, police, charity, or expenses of State administration, would be to disregard to the amount of the value of the public lands all the limitations of the Constitution and confound to that extent all distinctions between the rights and powers of the States and those of the United States; for if the public lands may be applied to the support of the poor, whether sane or insane, if the disposal of them and their proceeds be not subject to the ordinary limitations of the Constitution, then Congress possesses unqualified power to provide for expenditures in the States by means of the public lands, even to the degree of defraying the salaries of governors, judges, and all other expenses of the government and internal administration within the several States.\n\n'The conclusion from the general survey of the whole subject is to my mind irresistible, and closes the question both of right and of expediency so far as regards the principle of the appropriation proposed in this bill. Would not the admission of such power in Congress to dispose of the public domain work the practical abrogation of some of the most important provisions of the Constitution? ... \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 609]\n\u00a0\n 'The general result at which I have arrived is the necessary consequence of those views of the relative rights, powers, and duties of the States and of the Federal Government which I have long entertained and often expressed and in reference to which my convictions do but increase in force with time and experience.'\n\n No defense is offered for the legislation under review upon the basis of emergency. The hypothesis is that hereafter it will continuously benefit unemployed members of a class. Forever, so far as we can see, the states are expected to function under federal direction concerning an internal matter. By the sanction of this adventure, the door is open for progressive inauguration of others of like kind under which it can hardly be expected that the states will retain genuine independence of action. And without independent states a Federal Union as contemplated by the Constitution becomes impossible.\n At the bar counsel asserted that under the present act the tax upon residents of Alabama during the first year will total $9,000,000. All would remain in the Federal Treasury but for the adoption by the state of measures agreeable to the National Board. If continued, these will bring relief from the payment of $8,000,000 to the United States.\n Ordinarily, I must think, a denial that the challenged action of Congress and what has been done under it amount to coercion and impair freedom of government by the people of the state would be regarded as contrary to practical experience. Unquestionably our federate plan of government confronts an enlarged peril.\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND.\n With most of what is said in the opinion just handed down, I concur. I agree that the pay roll tax levied is an excise within the power of Congress; that the devotion of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 610]\n\u00a0\n not more than 90 per cent. of it to the credit of employers in states which require the payment of a similar tax under so-called unemployment- tax laws is not an unconstitutional use of the proceeds of the federal tax; that the provision making the adoption by the state of an unemployment law of a specified character a condition precedent to the credit of the tax does not render the law invalid. I agree that the states are not coerced by the federal legislation into adopting unemployment legislation. The provisions of the federal law may operate to induce the state to pass an employment law if it regards such action to be in its interest. But that is not coercion. If the act stopped here, I should accept the conclusion of the court that the legislation is not unconstitutional.\n But the question with which I have difficulty is whether the administrative provisions of the act invade the governmental administrative powers of the several states reserved by the Tenth Amendment. A state may enter into contracts; but a state cannot, by contract or statute, surrender the execution, or a share in the execution, of any of its governmental powers either to a sister state or to the federal government, any more than the federal government can surrender the control of any of its governmental powers to a foreign nation. The power to tax is vital and fundamental, and, in the highest degree, governmental in character. Without it, the state could not exist. Fundamental also, and no less important, is the governmental power to expend the moneys realized from taxation, and exclusively to administer the laws in respect of the character of the tax and the methods of laying and collecting it and expending the proceeds.\n The people of the United States, by their Constitution, have affirmed a division of internal governmental powers between the federal government and the governments of the several states-committing to the first its powers by express grant and necessary implication; to the latter, or \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 611]\n\u00a0\n to the people, by reservation, 'the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States.' The Constitution thus affirms the complete supremacy and independence of the state within the field of its powers. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 295\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, 865. The federal government has no more authority to invade that field than the state has to invade the exclusive field of national governmental powers; for, in the oft-repeated words of this court in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725, 'the preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government.' The necessity of preserving each from every form of illegitimate intrusion or interference on the part of the other is so imperative as to require this court, when its judicial power is properly invoked, to view with a careful and discriminating eye any legislation challenged as constituting such an intrusion or interference. See South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 448\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737.\n The precise question, therefore, which we are required to answer by an application of these principles is whether the congressional act contemplates a surrender by the state to the federal government, in whole or in part, of any state governmental power to administer its own unemployment law or the state pay roll-tax funds which it has collected for the purposes of that law. An affirmative answer to this question, I think, must be made.\n I do not, of course, doubt the power of the state to select and utilize a depository for the safe-keeping of its funds; but it is quite another thing to agree with the selected depository that the funds shall be withdrawn for certain stipulated purposes, and for no other. Nor do I doubt the authority of the federal government and a state government to co- operate to a common end, pro- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 612]\n\u00a0\n vided each of them is authorized to reach it. But such co-operation must be effectuated by an exercise of the powers which they severally possess, and not by an exercise, through invasion or surrender, by one of them of the governmental power of the other.\n An illustration of what I regard as permissible co-operation is to be found in title I of the act now under consideration. By that title, federal appropriations for oldage assistance are authorized to be made to any state which shall have adopted a plan for old-age assistance conforming to designated requirements. But the state is not obliged, as a condition of having the federal bounty, to deposit in the federal treasury funds raised by the state. The state keeps its own funds and administers its own law in respect of them, without let or hindrance of any kind on the part of the federal government; so that we have simply the familiar case of federal aid upon conditions which the state, without surrendering any of its powers, may accept or not as it chooses. Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 480\n, 482 S., 483, 43 S.Ct. 597, 598, 599.\n But this is not the situation with which we are called upon to deal in the present case. For here, the state must deposit the proceeds of its taxation in the federal treasury, upon terms which make the deposit suspiciously like a forced loan to be repaid only in accordance with restrictions imposed by federal law. Title IX,  903(a)(3), 904(a), (b), ( e), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a) (3), 1104(a, b, e). All moneys withdrawn from this fund must be used exclusively for the payment of compensation. Section 903(a)(4), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a)(4). And this compensation is to be paid through public employment offices in the state or such other agencies as a federal board may approve. Section 903(a)(1), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(a)(1). The act, it is true, recognizes section 903(a)(6), 42 U.S.C.A .  1103(a)(6) the power of the Legislature to amend or repeal its compensation law at any time. But there is nothing in the act, as I read it, which justifies the conclusion that the state may, in that event, unconditionally withdraw its \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 613]\n\u00a0\n funds from the federal treasury. Section 903(b), 42 U.S.C.A.  1103(b), provides that the board shall certify in each taxable year to the Secretary of the Treasury each state whose law has been approved. But the board is forbidden to certify any state which the board finds has so changed its law that it no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a), 'or has with respect to such taxable year failed to comply substantially with any such provision.' The federal government, therefore, in the person of its agent, the board, sits not only as a perpetual overseer, interpreter and censor of state legislation on the subject, but, as lord paramount, to determine whether the state is faithfully executing its own law-as though the state were a dependency under pupilage1 and not to be trusted. The foregoing, taken in connection with the provisions that money withdrawn can be used only in payment of compensation and that it must be paid through an agency approved by the federal board, leaves it, to say the least, highly uncertain whether the right of the state to withdraw any part of its own funds exists, under the act, otherwise than upon these various statutory conditions. It is true also that subsection ( f) of section 904, 42 U.S.C.A.  1104(f), authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to any state agency 'such amount as it may duly requisition, not exceeding the amount standing to the account of such State agency at the time of such payment.' But it is to be observed that the payment is to be made to the state agency, and only such amount as that agency may duly requisition. It is hard to find in this provision any extension of the right of the state to withdraw its funds except in the manner and for the specific purpose prescribed by the act.\n By these various provisions of the act, the federal agencies are authorized to supervise and hamper the administrative powers of the state to a degree which not only does not comport with the dignity of a quasi sov- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 614]\n\u00a0\n ereign state-a matter with which we are not judicially concerned-but which deny to it that supremacy and freedom from external interference in respect of its affairs which the Constitution contemplates-a matter of very definite judicial concern. I refer to some, though by no means all, of the cases in point.\n In the License Cases, 5 How. 504, 588, Mr. Justice McLean said that the federal government was supreme within the scope of its delegated powers, and the state governments equally supreme in the exercise of the powers not delegated nor inhibited to them; that the states exercise their powers over everything connected with their social and internal condition; and that over these subjects the federal government had no power. 'They appertain to the State sovereignty as exclusively as powers exclusively delegated appertain to the general government.'\n In Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, Mr. Justice Field, after pointing out that the general government and the state are separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other within their respective spheres, said that, except in one particular, they stood in the same independent relation to each other as they would if their authority embraced distinct territories. The one particular referred to is that of the supremacy of the authority of the United States in case of conflict between the two.\n In Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 \nU.S. 679\n, 685, this court said, 'Yet every State has a sphere of action where the authority of the national government may not intrude. Within that domain the State is as if the union were not. Such are the checks and balances in our complicated but wise system of State and national polity.'\n'The powers exclusively given to the federal government,' it was said in Worcester v. State of Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 570, 'are limitations upon the state authorities. But \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 615]\n\u00a0\n with the exception of these limitations, the states are supreme; and their sovereignty can be no more invaded by the action of the general government, than the action of the state governments can arrest or obstruct the course of the national power.'\n\n The force of what has been said is not broken by an acceptance of the view that the state is not coerced by the federal law. The effect of the dual distribution of powers is completely to deny to the states whatever is granted exclusively to the nation, and, conversely, to deny to the nation whatever is reserved exclusively to the states. 'The determination of the Framers Convention and the ratifying conventions to preserve complete and unimpaired state self-government in all matters not committed to the general government is one of the plainest facts which emerges from the history of their deliberations. And adherence to that determination is incumbent equally upon the federal government and the states. State powers can neither be appropriated on the one hand nor abdicated on the other.' Carter v. Carter Coal Co., supra, \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, at page 295, 56 S.Ct. 855, 866. The purpose of the Constitution in that regard does not admit of doubt or qualification; and it can be thwarted no more by voluntary surrender from within than by invasion from without.\n Nor may the constitutional objection suggested be overcome by the expectation of public benefit resulting from the federal participation authorized by the act. Such expectation, if voiced in support of a proposed constitutional enactment, would be quite proper for the consideration of the legislative body. But, as we said in the Carter Case, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, at page 291, 56 S.Ct. 855, 864, 'nothing is more certain than that beneficent aims, however great or well directed, can never serve in lieu of constitutional power.' Moreover, everything which the act seeks to do for the relief of unemployment might have been accomplished, as is done by this same act for the relief of the misfortunes of old age, with- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 616]\n\u00a0\n out obliging the state to surrender, or share with another government, any of its powers.\n If we are to survive as the United States, the balance between the powers of the nation and those of the states must be maintained. There is grave danger in permitting it to dip in either direction, danger-if there were no other-in the precedent thereby set for further departures from the equipoise. The threat implicit in the present encroachment upon the administrative functions of the states is that greater encroachments, and encroachments upon other functions, will follow.\n For the foregoing reasons, I think the judgment below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER joins in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n I think that the objections to the challenged enactment expressed in the separate opinions of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND are well taken. I am also of opinion that, in principle and as applied to bring about and to gain control over state unemployment compensation, the statutory scheme is repugnant to the Tenth Amendment: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' The Constitution grants to the United States no power to pay unemployed persons or to require the states to enact laws or to raise or disburse money for that purpose. The provisions in question, if not amounting to coercion in a legal sense, are manifestly designed and intended directly to affect state action in the respects specified. And, if valid as so employed, this 'tax and credit' device may be made effective to enable federal authorities to induce, if not indeed to compel, state enactments for any purpose within the realm of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 617]\n\u00a0\n state power and generally to control state administration of state laws.\n The act creates a Social Security Board and imposes upon it the duty of studying and making recommendations as to legislation and as to administrative policies concerning unemployment compensation and related subjects. Section 702, 42 U.S.C.A.  902. It authorizes grants of money by the United States to States for old age assistance, for administration of unemployment compensation, for aid to dependent children, for maternal and child welfare and for public health. Each grant depends upon state compliance with conditions prescribed by federal authority. The amounts given being within the discretion of the Congress, it may at any time make available federal money sufficient effectively to influence state policy, standards and details of administration.\n The excise laid by section 901 (42 U.S.C.A.  1101) is limited to specified employers. It is not imposed to raise money to pay unemployment compensation. But it is imposed having regard to that subject for, upon enactment of state laws for that purpose in conformity with federal requirements specified in the act, each of the employers subject to the federal tax becomes entitled to credit for the amount he pays into an unemployment fund under a state law up to 90 per cent. of the federal tax. The amounts yielded by the remaining 10 per cent., not assigned to any specific purpose, may be applied to pay the federal contributions and expenses in respect of state unemployment compensation. It is not yet possible to determine more closely the sums that will be needed for these purposes.\n When the federal act was passed, Wisconsin was the only state paying unemployment compensation. Though her plan then in force is by students of the subject generally deemed the best yet devised, she found it necessary to change her law in order to secure federal approval. In the absence of that, Wisconsin employers subject to the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 548, 618]\n\u00a0\n federal tax would not have been allowed any deduction on account of their contribution to the state fund. Any state would be moved to conform to federal requirements, not utterly objectionable, in order to save its taxpayers from the federal tax imposed in addition to the contributions under state laws.\n Federal agencies prepared and took draft bills to state Legislatures to enable and induce them to pass laws providing for unemployment compensation in accordance with federal requirements and thus to obtain relief for the employers from the impending federal exaction. Obviously the act creates the peril of federal tax not to raise revenue but to persuade. Of course, each state was free to reject any measure so proposed. But, if it failed to adopt a plan acceptable to federal authority, the full burden of the federal tax would be exacted. And, as federal demands similarly conditioned may be increased from time to time as Congress shall determine, possible federal pressure in that field is without limit. Already at least forty-three states, yielding to the inducement resulting immediately from the application of the federal tax and credit device, have provided for unemployment compensation in form to merit approval of the Social Security Board. Presumably the remaining States will comply whenever convenient for their Legislatures to pass the necessary laws.\n The terms of the measure make it clear that the tax and credit device was intended to enable federal officers virtually to control the exertion of powers of the states in a field in which they alone have jurisdiction and from which the United States is by the Constitution excluded.\n I am of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 903. (a) The Social Security Board shall approve any State law submitted to it, within thirty days of such submission, which it finds provides that-\n (1) All compensation is to be paid through public employment offices in the State or such other agencies as the Board may approve;\n (2) No compensation shall be payable with respect to any day of unemployment occurring within two years after the first day of the first period with respect to which contributions are required;\n (3) All money received in the unemployment fund shall immediately upon such receipt be paid over to the Secretary of the Treasury to the credit of the Unemployment Trust Fund established by Section 904 (section 1104 of this chapter);\n (4) All money withdrawn from the Unemployment Trust Fund by the State agency shall be used solely in the payment of compensation, exclusive of expenses of administration;\n (5) Compensation shall not be denied in such State to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: (A) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; (B) if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; (C) if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization;\n (6) All the rights, privileges, or immunities conferred by such law or by acts done pursuant thereto shall exist subject to the power of the legislature to amend or repeal such law at any time.\n The Board shall, upon approving such law, notify the Governor of the State of its approval.\n (b) On December 31 in each taxable year the Board shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury each State whose law it has previously approved, except that it shall not certify any State which, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Board finds has changed its law so that it no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a) or has with respect to such taxable year failed to comply substantially with any such provision.\n (c) If, at any time during the taxable year, the Board has reason to believe that a State whose law it has previously approved, may not be certified under subsection (b), it shall promptly so notify the Governor of such State. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 904. (a) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the 'Unemployment Trust Fund,' hereinafter (in this title) called the 'Fund'. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive and hold in the Fund all moneys deposited therein by a State agency from a State unemployment fund. Such deposit may be made directly with the Secretary of the Treasury or with any Federal reserve bank or member bank of the Federal Reserve System designated by him for such purpose.\n (b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at par, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended (section 752 of Title 31), are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple or one- eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. Obligations other than such special obligations may be acquired for the Fund only on such terms as to provide an investment yield not less than the yield which would be required in the case of special obligations if issued to the Fund upon the date of such acquisition.\n (c) Any obligations acquired by the Fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund) may be sold at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.\n (d) The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.\n (e) The Fund shall be invested as a single fund, but the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain a separate book account for each State agency and shall credit quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year, to each account, on the basis of the average daily balance of such account, a proportionate part of the earnings of the Fund for the quarter ending on such date.\n (f) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay out of the Fund to any State agency such amount as it may duly requisition, not exceeding the amount standing to the account of such State agency at the time of such payment. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The list of services is comprehensive.

Unemployment reserve funds have the peculiarity that the demands upon them fluctuate considerably, being heaviest when business slackens. If, in such times, the securities in which these funds are invested are thrown upon the market for liquidation, the net effect is likely to be increased deflation. Such a result is avoided in this bill through the provision that all reserve funds are to be held by the United States Treasury, to be invested and liquidated by the Secretary of the Treasury in a manner calculated to promote business stability. When business conditions are such that investment in securities purchased on the open market is unwise, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue special nonnegotiable obligations exclusively to the unemployment trust fund. When a reverse situation exists and heavy drains are made upon the fund for payment of unemployment benefits, the Treasury does not have to dispose of the securities belonging to the fund in open market but may assume them itself. With such a method of handling the reserve funds, it is believed that this bill will solve the problem often raised in discussions of unemployment compensation, regarding the possibility of transferring purchasing power from boom periods to depression periods. It will in fact operate to sustain purchasing power at the onset of a depression without having any counteracting deflationary tendencies.'

Strawn, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. George I. Haight, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent was organized as a corporation under the laws of Illinois; and pursuant to those laws it was dissolved. The only property it ever owned or possessed was a building and the land upon which it stood, situated at \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n No. 4136 Wilcox avenue in the city of Chicago. This property, when acquired, was subject to the lien of a first mortgage, securing bonds aggregating $95,000, and, subsequent to the acquisition of the property, to a junior mortgage to secure the payment of $15,000. The corporation was organized on April 10, 1929. On May 22, 1931, the superior court of Cook county, Ill., in a proceeding regularly before it, and in accordance with a statute of Illinois, entered a decree dissolving the corporation and declaring its charter and authority as such to be null and void. The decree has never been appealed from or otherwise challenged or assailed. That it became and is now effective cannot be doubted.\n On July 10th, certain mechanics' liens were foreclosed, and a sale of the property thereafter made pursuant to the foreclosure decree. Certificate of sale was issued, entitling the holder thereof to a conveyance of the property upon the expiration of the period of redemption. The right of redemption expired as to respondent on August 5, 1932, and as to creditors on November 5, 1932. No redemption has ever been made or attempted. On October 24, 1931, suit was brought in a state court to foreclose the lien of the first mortgage; and on November 10, 1931, suit was brought in the same court to foreclose the lien of the junior mortgage. A receiver was appointed, who took possession of the property, and was in possession thereof at the time this case was heard in the federal District Court. Respondent appeared in both foreclosure suits, but apparently offered no defense.\n By the statutes of Illinois (Laws 1919, pp. 312, 334 (Smith-Hurd Ill. Stats. c. 32,  157.94 note)) it is provided:\n's 14.

Such corporations shall use their respective names for such purposes and shall be capable of prosecuting and defending all suits at law or in equity. ...\n\n's 79. The dissolution, for any cause whatever, of any corporation, shall not take away or impair any remedy given against such corporation, its officers, or stockholders, for any liabilities incurred previous to its dissolution, if suit therefor is brought and service of process had within two years after such dissolution.'\n\n The two-year period, within which the corporation could sue, acquire property, or perform any corporate function apart from suits then pending, expired May 22, 1933\n\n\n Thus matters remained until May, 1935, when three persons, namely, Mrs. Fay Fischel, her father Hyman Schulman, and her brother Sam Schulman, acquired all the shares of the respondent from the then stockholders. Meetings purporting to be stockholders' and directors' meetings were then held, officers and directors elected, and a resolution was passed authorizing the filing of a petition for the reorganization of respondent under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.  207 (11 U.S.C.A.  207).\n On June 13, 1935, respondent filed a petition for reorganization under section 77B; and on June 21st filed a petition praying for an order directing the receiver in the state foreclosure suits to turn over property in his possession and restraining the further prosecution of such suits. Petitioner answered, denying that respondent was a corporation, setting up the corporate dissolution, the foreclosure proceedings, and the sale of the corporate property. It also averred that the bankruptcy petition was not filed in good faith.\n The special master, to whom the case was referred, found and reported that the bankruptcy petition had been filed in good faith; that respondent had legal capacity to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n file the petition; and that the petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court over respondent and the property in question. The master further found that no deed ever issued under the mechanic's lien foreclosure certificate; and that such certificate was purchased and now is the property of the debtor. However, it appears from the record that the certificate was purchased in connection with the acquisition of the stock by the three persons already mentioned, more than two years after the period of redemption had expired.\n The federal District Court confirmed the report of the master, appointed a temporary trustee, required the state-court receiver to turn over the property to the trustee, and restrained further prosecution of the foreclosure proceedings. On appeal, the court below affirmed the order of the District Court, Judge Briggle dissenting. In re Forty-One Thirty- Six Wilcox Bldg. Corporation (C.C.A.) 86 F.(2d) 667.\n In the decisions of other circuit courts of appeal, cited by respondent, support may be found for involuntary proceedings in bankruptcy against a dissolved corporation, brought by creditors and based upon an act of bankruptcy committed within four months. The question presented here differs substantially from the questions presented in those cases; and we put them aside as inapplicable, without either approval or disapproval. The sole question now for determination is whether, under the facts just detailed, a corporation, dissolved and put out of existence by the state which created it, may, nevertheless, itself invoke the powers of a court of bankruptcy under section 77B. The record does not present a case where creditors are the moving parties, or where there has been any act of bankruptcy committed by the corporation, or where any pertinent law of the state is in conflict with the federal bankruptcy laws.\n The decisions of this court are all to the effect that a private corporation in this country can exist only under \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n the express law of the state or sovereignty by which it was created. Its dissolution puts an end to its existence, the result of which may be likened to the death of a natural person. There must be some statutory authority for the prolongation of its life, even for litigation purposes. Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, \n273 \nU.S. 257\n, 47 S.Ct. 391; First National Bank v. Colby, 21 Wall. 609, 615; Oregon Railway Co. v. Oregonian Ry. Co., \n130 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 9 S.Ct. 409; see, also, Greeley v. Smith, 10 Fed.Cas. p. 1075, No. 5,748, 3 Story 657; Board of Councilmen v. Deposit Bank (C.C.) 120 F. 165, 166 et seq.; Dundee Mortg. & T. Inv. Co. v. Hughes (C.C.) 77 F. 855.\n Sections 14 and 79 of the Illinois statute (Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 32,  157.94 note) seem plain enough on their face; but, if any doubt as to their meaning and effect would otherwise exist, that doubt has been set at rest by the decisions of the Illinois appellate courts. In Life Ass'n of America v. Fassett, 102 Ill. 315, decided before the sections under consideration were enacted, the state Supreme Court held that it was the settled policy of the state that upon the dissolution of domestic corporations, however effected, they were to be regarded as still existing for the purpose of settling up their affairs and having their property applied for the payment of their just debts. See Singer & Talcott Co. v. Hutchinson, 176 Ill. 48, 51, 51 N.E. 622. In American Exch. Bank v. Mitchell, 179 Ill.App. 612, 615, 616, the general rule was announced that, after a corporation is dissolved, it is incapable of maintaining an action; and that all such actions pending at the time of dissolution abate, in the absence of a statute to the contrary. The state decisions following the enactment of these sections make it clear that this general rule still remains in force in Illinois except for the specific modifications in respect of time and circumstance set forth in sections 14 and 79. See Dukes v. Harrison & Reidy, 270 Ill.App. 372; Consolidated Coal Co. v. Flynn Coal Co., 274 Ill.App. 405. See, also, A. J. Bates Co. v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 3 F.Supp. 245, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 126]\n\u00a0\n 248; Charles A. Zahn Co. v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 6 F.Supp. 317, where the Court of Claims held that under these sections of the Illinois statute an Illinois corporation ceased to exist and became incapable of transacting any business whatever in its corporate capacity; and that a suit purporting to be brought by a dissolved corporation after two years to recover internal revenue taxes paid by the corporation could not be maintained.\n It is plain enough, under the Illinois statute, that after the expiration of two years from the date of its dissolution, respondent was without corporate capacity to initiate any legal proceeding-including a proceeding under section 77B, unless we are able to say that the statute, in its terms or in its application, is in conflict with section 77B. While state laws in conflict with the laws of Congress on the subject of bankruptcies are suspended, they are suspended 'only to the extent of actual conflict with the system provided by the Bankruptcy Act of Congress.' Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 613\n, 38 S.Ct. 215, 217. The dissolution effected under Illinois law is in no way related to a state of insolvency or bankruptcy. Insolvency or bankruptcy as a ground for dissolution is not within the terms or contemplation of the law. Liquidation of a corporation is no part of the purpose of the dissolution; nor is insolvency or liquidation involved in the proceedings to enforce the mechanics' liens or foreclose the mortgages. Quite evidently, the latter were simply ordinary proceedings to enforce liens against the property subject thereto. Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318\n, 327-330, 51 S.Ct. 465, 469, 470. The state receivership was purely incidental to the foreclosure suits, and therefore limited and special. It was not an equity receivership within the meaning of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  207). Duparquet Co. v. Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, 219-221, 56 S.Ct. 412, 413, 414.\n The principle recently announced in Hopkins Savings Ass'n v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315, 337\n, 56 S.Ct. 235, 241, 100 A.L.R. 1403, is applicable here. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 127]\n\u00a0\n That case dealt with an intrusion by the federal government on the powers of the state over state building and loan associations. Speaking of these associations, this court said: 'How they shall be formed, how maintained and supervised, and how and when dissolved are matters of governmental policy, which it would be an intrusion for another government to regulate by statute or decision, except when reasonably necessary for the fair and effective exercise of some other and cognate power explicitly conferred.' It is not reasonably possible to find any conflict between section 77B and the Illinois statute or the dissolution proceedings or the lien foreclosure suits.\n The court below relied upon its former decision in the case of In re 211 East Delaware Place Bldg. Corporation (C.C.A.) 76 F.(2d) 834. That was a case, however, where the bankruptcy petition had been filed by creditors, not by the dissolved corporation; and, therefore, the capacity of the defunct corporation to institute proceedings was not involved. We express no opinion as to the correctness of this decision; but Judge Evans, who wrote the opinion, apparently regarded the distinction as important. For in a later proceeding in the case (D.C.) 14 F.Supp. 96, 100, he said that the forfeiture of the charter of the corporation did not prevent such a proceeding by creditors, and then added, 'The only effect which this loss of corporate existence may have upon a bankruptcy proceeding is in respect to the inability of the corporation to admit acts of bankruptcy or state of insolvency or to file a voluntary petition.' (Italics supplied.)\n How long and upon what terms a state-created corporation may continue to exist is a matter exclusively of state power. Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 305, 312\n, 313 S., 12 S.Ct. 403; Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 443 S., 14 S.Ct. 865; New Jersey v. Anderson, \n203 \nU.S. 483, 493\n, 27 S.Ct. 137. The circumstances under which the power shall be exercised \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 128]\n\u00a0\n and the extent to which it shall be carried are matters of state policy, to be decided by the state Legislature. There is nothing in the Federal Constitution which operates to restrain a state from terminating absolutely and unconditionally the existence of a state-created corporation, if that be authorized by the statute under which the corporation has been organized. And it hardly will be claimed that the federal government may breathe life into a corporate entity thus put to death by the state in the lawful exercise of its sovereign authority.\n The power to take the long step of putting an end to the corporate existence of a state-created corporation without limitation connotes the power to take the shorter one of putting an end to it with such limitations as the Legislature sees fit to annex. Compare Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 145\n, 44 S.Ct. 257, 259; Davis v. Massachusetts, \n167 \nU.S. 43, 47\n, 17 S.Ct. 731; Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 510 S., 24 S.Ct. 516. And, since the federal government is powerless to resurrect a corporation which the state has put out of existence for all purposes, the conclusion seems inevitable that, if the state attach qualifications to its sentence of extinction, nothing can be added to or taken from these qualifications by federal authority.\n It is suggested that the state cannot keep the corporation alive for its own purposes and deny it life for federal purposes. The proposition need not be challenged, since it is perfectly evident that here the state has reserved nothing for itself which it has denied to the federal authority. The only relevant provisions are those relating to legal proceedings. The state law permits such proceedings to be instituted on behalf of a dissolved corporation within two years; but these proceedings may be brought either in the state courts, or, when appropriate, in the federal courts. After two years, no proceedings may be initiated on behalf of the corporation in either state or federal courts, but such proceedings as \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 129]\n\u00a0\n have been instituted during that period in any of these courts may be prosecuted to completion. Singer & Talcott Co. v. Hutchinson, supra, 176 Ill. 48, at pages 52, 53, 51 N.E. 622. The right of resort to the courts of the state, and to those of the nation having jurisdiction, both in respect of the initiation of proceedings and the completion of proceedings already initiated, so far as Illinois law is concerned, stands upon an exact parity.\n The aim of this proceeding under section 77B is to bring about a reorganization of a corporation which has been dissolved and shorn of its capacity to initiate any legal proceeding by the state which possesses, in respect of the corporation, the power of life and death. It is not a proceeding on behalf of creditors. It is not a liquidation proceeding having for its object the distribution of the corporate assets. The dissolution was adjudged because the corporation had disobeyed the laws of the state. For that reason the state prohibited the continuance of the corporate enterprise. The stockholders, however, now seek to escape the penalty for this dereliction by resuscitating and continuing the corporation, and, to that end, invoke the aid of a federal statute. This is simply an attempt to thwart a valid state law. Whether the enterprise be continued under the original name and charter of the corporation, or in some new corporate name or guise, can make no difference. Either course would contravene the legislatively declared policy of the state. Section 77B cannot be regarded as countenancing such a result.\n The only power left to the corporation when this proceeding was brought was to finish pending cases begun within two years after its dissolution. With that exception, its corporate powers were ended for all time and for all purposes. It was without authority to purchase the certificate issued at the mechanic's lien foreclosure sale, or to adopt resolutions authorizing proceedings under \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 130]\n\u00a0\n section 77B, or to bring a proceeding to effectuate a reorganization under that section. In respect of these matters the corporation was nonexistent.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the opinion of the Court.\n\n 1. \nRespondent, though dissolved, was still a corporation in such a sense and to such a degree as to have capacity to maintain a proceeding in bankruptcy for the liquidation of its assets.\n By Bankruptcy Act  4 (11 U.S.C.  22(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  22(a), any corporation, with exceptions not now material, may become a voluntary bankrupt.\n By Bankruptcy Act  1(6) as amended (11 U.S.C.  1(6), 11 U.S.C.A.  1(6), \"corporations' shall mean all bodies having any of the powers and privileges of private corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships.'\n Respondent, when it filed its petition in the bankruptcy court, was still in possession of some of the privileges and powers of private corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships. True, a decree of dissolution had been entered by a court of Illinois, the place of its domicile. True, two years had gone by since the making of that decree. None the less, the corporation still had the power, if suits were then pending either in its favor or against it, to litigate in its corporate name and through its corporate officials. Life Association of America v. Fassett, 102 Ill. 315; Singer & Talcott Stone Co. v. Hutchinson, 176 Ill. 48, 51 N.E. 622; Commercial Trust Co. v. Mallers, 242 Ill. 50, 89 N.E. 661, 134 Am.St.Rep. 306, 17 Ann.Cas. 224; Graham & Morton Transp. Co. v. Owens, 165 Ill.App. 100; Griggsville State Bank v. Newman, 275 Ill.App. 11. With the license of Illinois, respondent was actively defending suits for the foreclosure of mortgages on its property when it went into the federal court. A fragment of corporate power was \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 131]\n\u00a0\n thus untouched by dissolution. Within the definition of the Bankruptcy Act, the body that retained this power, and indeed exercised it too, was still a corporation. There are suggestions in the books that, even in the absence of a statute preserving corporate capacities after a decree of dissolution, the bankruptcy power to distribute the assets of an insolvent debtor is not subject to destruction by a withdrawal, possibly a precipitate one, of corporate existence. See, e.g., Hammond v. Lyon Realty Co. (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 592, 594, 595. Cf. Austin v. Thomas (C.C.A.) 78 F.( 2d) 602; In re American & British Mfg. Corporation (D.C.) 300 F. 839, 847; Cresson & Clearfield Coal Co. v. Stauffer (C.C.A.) 148 F. 981. The case at hand does not charge us with a duty to decide whether that is so. Here the state has elected to keep the corporation in existence, maimed but still alive. In choosing to create or continue an artificial entity, though with limited and narrow powers, the state subjects its creature to the bankruptcy power of the Congress in so far as that power is directed at juristic beings of that order. Congress has said to Illinois: 'If an association with any corporate capacities exists under your laws, bankruptcy-either voluntary or involuntary-is a proper form of liquidation.' To this the state responds, or is figured as responding: 'An association with corporate capacities does exist under our laws, but it may not go into a court of bankruptcy because we will not give it the capacity to go there. Winding up proceedings for one in its position are in the state tribunals only.' The response, even if taken to be authentic, must be held of no avail. It is not within the competence of Illinois by any form of words to preserve the artificial entity for a purpose of her own and destroy it for the purpose of withdrawal from the supremacy of federal law.\n\n 2. \nIf respondent has capacity to maintain a bankruptcy proceeding to liquidate its business through the medium of a sale for cash, it has capacity also to maintain a bankruptcy proceeding under section 77B (11 U. S.C.A.  207). \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 132]\n\u00a0\n A proceeding under section 77B is styled one to give effect to a corporate reorganization. Whatever its form or label, it derives its origin and vitality from the bankruptcy power. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, 55 S.Ct. 595; Campbell v. Alleghany Corporation (C. C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 947; In re New Rochelle Coal & Lumber Co. (C.C.A.) 77 F.( 2d) 881. Only because the remedy is traceable to that power is it constitutional and valid. The notion is baseless that reorganization, even when initiated on the petition of the debtor, is solely or chiefly for the benefit of shareholders. It is even more distinctively and commonly for the benefit of creditors. Cf. In re Central Funding Corporation (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 256, 261. The old form of bankruptcy had in view a liquidation of the assets for cash and nothing else, a method of disposing of them that might result in needless sacrifice. The new form of bankruptcy is more flexible and often more efficient, permitting, as it does, a disposition of the assets upon credit as well as for cash, and in consideration of shares of stock or bonds to be issued by the buyer. Whoever, being a corporation, may resort to the old form, is at liberty, acting in good faith, to resort to the new. This is so by the express mandate of the statute, which tells us (section 77B(a), 11 U.S.C.  207(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(a), that 'any corporation which could become a bankrupt under section 4 (11 U.S.C.  22 (11 U.S.C.A.  22)) of this Act' may petition in the new proceeding. By that test a dissolved corporation with capacity requisite to apply to a court of bankruptcy for a liquidation of its assets has the capacity requisite to apply for a reorganization of its business. As to this, the lower federal courts are in general accord. Old Fort Improvement Co. v. Lea (C.C.A.) 89 F.(2d) 286; In re Forty-One Thirty- Six Wilcox Bldg. Corporation (C.C.A.) 86 F.(2d) 667; Capital Endowment Co. v. Kroeger (C.C.A.) 86 F.(2d) 976; In re 211 East Delaware Place Bldg. Corporation (C.C.A.) 76 F.(2d) 834, 836. Their opinions vindicating that conclusion are instructive and convincing. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 133]\n\u00a0\n This is not to say that every method of reorganization appropriate or permissible for a corporation whose life is unimpaired is appropriate or permissible for one already doomed. The plan of reorganization will be unlawful if it attempts to authorize the debtor, following a decree of dissolution, to do business thereafter in defiance of state law. In general, there will be little difficulty in so adapting a decree to the necessities of the particular case as to attain the needed harmony. The opinions already cited suggest appropriate expedients. Old Fort Improvement Co. v. Lea, supra, 89 F.(2d) 286, at page 290; Capital Endowment Co. v. Kroeger, supra, 86 F.(2d) 976, at page 979. Instead of continuing the business through the petitioning debtor or its agents, the decree may permit the formation of another corporation which will take over the assets, issuing shares of stock or bonds to creditors or others. There may be new capital, new shareholders, new directors, and officers. Neither in the record nor in the precedents does one find a basis for a holding that the formation of such a corporation will be in conflict with any public policy of the state of Illinois. The old corporation was dissolved for failure to pay franchise taxes and file an annual report. The new one, if created, may promote the welfare of the state both financially and otherwise. Be that as it may, the state will be amply competent to vindicate her own dignity if there is a fraud upon her laws. No plan of reorganization is before us at this time. So far as appears, none has been prepared. Whether the plan to be submitted later will be worthy of confirmation is a question for the future.\n Cases may indeed arise where a court will be satisfied upon the filing of the petition that reorganization is not feasible. In that event the proceeding may be dismissed as not brought in good faith. Tennessee Pub. Co. v. American Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 57 S.Ct. 85, 87. At times a decree of dissolution may be a circumstance along with others point- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 120, 134]\n\u00a0\n ing to that conclusion. Here the good faith of the debtor has been found by the courts below after inquiry by a master to whom the cause had been referred. The single question presented to us by the petition for certiorari is one of jurisdiction. Did a court of bankruptcy have power to entertain the proceeding at the instance of such a suitor? I hold that power did not fail.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice BLACK join in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHIPPEWA INDIANS OF MINNESOTA v. UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 228\nArgued: February 2, 1937Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Court of Claims. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 359]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Webster Ballinger, of Washington, D.C., and D. S. Holmes, of Duluth, Minn., for appellants.\n Mr. Golden W. Bell, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for appellee the United States.\n Mr. Fred Dennis, of Detroit Lakes, Minn., for appellee Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians of Minnesota.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit by the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota against the United States to recover the value of 663,421 acres of land alleged to have been ceded to the defendant \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 360]\n\u00a0\n under an express trust for the benefit of the plaintiffs and subsequently disposed of or appropriated by the defendant in disregard of the trust and of the rights of the plaintiffs. This 663,421 acres comprised what is hereinafter described as the diminished Red Lake Reservation.\n The suit was brought and conducted under permissive legislation. \n1\n The defendant traversed the allegations of the plaintiffs' petition; and by leave of court, and in virtue of authority given in the permissive legislation, the Red Lake Band of Chippewas intervened for the purpose of opposing the plaintiffs' claim and of protecting its own interests. After a full hearing the court made special findings of fact and rendered a judgment for the defendant. 80 Ct.Cl. 410. The plaintiffs were allowed an appeal to this Court under a special supplement to the permissive legislation.\n The Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, plaintiffs below and appellants here, comprise those who are designated in the Act of January 14, 1889, infra, as 'all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota,' otherwise described in the permissive legislation already mentioned,2 as all who are 'entitled to share in the final distribution of the permanent fund' provided for in section 7 of the act of 1889\n\n\n The findings below are too long to be repeated here and will be much summarized.\n About the beginning of the last century the Chippewas constituted one of the larger Indian tribes in the northerly part of the United States. In early treaties they were dealt with as a single tribe and were shown to be occupying a large area reaching from Lake Huron on the east \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 361]\n\u00a0\n to and beyond Lake Superior on the west. \n3\n In later treaties they were regarded as divided into distinct bands; and particular bands-in some instances a single band and in others a limited plurality of bands-were recognized as occupying separate areas in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Eastern Dakota, and as entitled to hold or cede the same independently of other bands and of the Chippewas as a whole. 4 Some of the bands became permanently settled in Michigan and Wisconsin. Others-usually as a single band and exceptionally as a group of a few bands-became the recognized occupants and holders of twelve separate reservations in Minnesota. It is to these Minnesota bands and reservations that this suit relates.\n One of the bands in Minnesota was the Red Lake which had come to include or be associated with the Pembina band. For a long period these two bands had been the exclusive occupants of the Red Lake Reservation, the largest of all. The next largest reservation was the White Earth. Its occupants were mostly members of the Mississippi bands; but some members of the latter were occupying older reservations which the White Earth had been designed to displace. This reservation contained an unusual proportion of land well suited for individual Indian allotments; and a small part of it had been allotted to individual Indians. The ten smaller \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n reservations require no other special mention than that some of the Indians belonging to them had received individual allotments in them.\n By an act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642, Congress proposed to all bands of Chippewas in Minnesota a plan for their relief and civilization through allotments in severalty, cession and sale of lands not required for allotments, placing and proceeds of sales, less various expenses, in a permanent interest-bearing fund as hereinafter stated, using the interest for the support and education of these Indians, and ultimately distributing per capita the principal of the fund.\n The act created a commission to negotiate with the different bands for a complete cession to the United States of their title and right to all of each reservation, 'except the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations, and to all and so much of these two reservations as in the judgment of said commission is not required to make and fill the allotments required by this and existing acts, and shall not have been reserved by the Commissioners for said purposes.'\n The cession was to be made for the purposes and upon the terms stated in the act and was to be sufficient as to each reservation, except the Red Lake, if made in writing by two-thirds of the male adults over eighteen years of age in the band occupying and belonging to such reservation, and as to the Red Lake was to be sufficient if made in like manner 'by two- thirds of the male adults of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.' All cession agreements were to become effective if and when approved by the President.\n For the purpose of ascertaining whether the proper number of Indians joined in the cession, and for the further purpose of making allotments and payments to \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 363]\n\u00a0\n individual Indians, the act required the commissioners to make an accurate census of each band, classifying the members as male and female adults and male and female minors, and further classifying the minors into those who were and those who were not orphans.\n As soon as the census was taken and the cession obtained the approved, all of the Chippewas in Minnesota, except those on the Red Lake Reservation, were to be removed to the White Earth Reservation; and as soon as practicable allotments in severalty were to be made on the Red Lake Reservation to the Indians belonging to that reservation, and on the White Earth Reservation to all of the other Chippewa Indians in Minnesota- all allotments to be in conformity with the act and with another designated statute. \n5\n These provisions for allotments were qualified by other provisions to the effect, first, that no existing allotment in any of the reservations should be disturbed, except with the allottee's individual consent; secondly, that existing allotments in the White Earth Reservation were ratified and should be adjusted in tenure, conditions and quantity to the allotments provided for in the act; and, thirdly, that any Indian on any of the reservations might in his discretion take his allotment under the act on the reservation where he was so residing, instead of being removed to and taking an allotment on the White Earth Reservation.\n As soon as the cession was obtained and approved the lands ceded to the United States were to be surveyed; and as soon as practicable after the survey the lands so ceded were to be examined and classified as pine lands or agricultural lands, and such as were classified as pine \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n lands were to be appraised with particular regard to the quantity and quality of the pine, and were to be sold by the United States at public auction, for cash, at not less than the appraised value, in 40-acre or smaller parcels.\n The agricultural lands 'not allotted under this act nor reserved for the future use of said Indians' were to be disposed of by the United States to actual settlers under the homestead law at $1.25 an acre, to be paid in five equal annual installments.\n As provided in section 7 of the act, all money accruing from the disposal of the ceded lands, after deducting enumerated expenses, was to be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of 'all the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota' as a permanent interest- bearing fund for the period of fifty years. The interest was to be used for the support and education of such Indians, and at the end of the fifty years the permanent fund was to be divided and paid to 'all of said Chippewa Indiana and their issue then living' in cash and equal shares, subject to a reserved power in Congress to make limited appropriations from the fund during the fifty-year period for the purpose of promoting civilization and self-support among these Indians.\n Under the act of 1889 the commission, besides making the required census, conducted separate negotiations with each of the bands with the following results:\n\n 1. \nThe Red Lake and Pembina bands (sometimes spoken of collectively as the Red Lake bank or Red Lake Indians), occupying and belonging to the Red Lake Reservation, ceded to the United States, for the purposes and upon the terms stated in the act, their title and right to all of that reservation, save a designated tract containing 661,118 acres which the commission 'reserved' for the purpose of making and filling allotments to them. The \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n cession was made by a written instrument showing what lands were reserved, and bearing the assent of more than two-thirds of the male adults over eighteen years of age in those bands.\n\n 2. \nThe bands occupying and belonging to the White Earth Reservation, by a like instrument bearing a like assent, ceded to the United States their title and right to all of that reservation, save a specified tract which the commission had reserved for allotments. The instrument making this cession contained a further cession by such bands of their title and right to 'all and so much of the Red Lake Reservation as is not required and reserved under the provisions of said act to make and fill the allotments to the Red Lake Indians in quantity and manner as therein provided.'\n\n 3. \nAs to each of the other ten reservations the band occupying and belonging to it, by a like instrument bearing a like assent, ceded the whole of such reservation to the United States, and included in the instrument a further cession respecting the Red Lake Reservation such as was included in the cession by the Indians of the White Earth Reservation.\n\n 4. \nThe cession of so much of the Red Lake Reservation as was not required and reserved for allotments had the written assent not only of two-thirds of the male adults over eighteen years of age in the bands of that reservation, but also of two-thirds of the male adults of such age of all the Chippewas in Minnesota.\n After making the census and obtaining the cessions the commission transmitted, through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to the Secretary of the Interior a report accompanied by the census, the instruments of cession, and a transcription of the negotiations with the several bands as stenographically reported. In its report the commission stated that the tract reserved by it from the Red Lake Reservation for allotments to the Red Lake In- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n dians, of which there wre then 1,168, contained 661,118 acres, and that 'this is larger than they will eventually require, but as there are swamps and other untillable lands therein, it cannot be reduced until after survey and allotments shall be made.'\n The Secretary of the Interior transmitted the commission's report and the accompanying papers to the President for consideration by him; and on March 4, 1890, the President approved each instrument of cession and on the same day transmitted to the Congress for its information a statement of his approval, together with a copy of the commission's report and of all accompanying papers except the census rolls. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n By an act of August 19, 1890, c. 807, 26 Stat. 336, 357, Congress recognized the cessions, as so approved, by making appropriations to carry out such provisions of the act of 1889 as were to be given effect if and when the cessions were obtained and approved.\n In instructions issued to the commission by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, before the work of the commission was begun, it was said:\n'It has not heretofore been claimed by anyone, and so far as the knowledge of this office extends, and certainly not by the Indians themselves, that the Red Lake Reservation is the common property of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota. None but the Red Lake and Pembina bands have ever claimed an interest in said reservation, and said bands have always been recognized and regarded as the sole owners by right of original Indian occupancy, the lands having never been ceded to the United States.'\n\n And the commission was further \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 367]\n\u00a0\n instructed that it was 'necessary to exercise great care to reserve a sufficient area of land to make the required allotments'; and also that 'the boundaries of the tracts so reserved ... must be definitely determined and fixed and accurately described so that the Indians ... ( will know) just what and how much land they are parting with.'\n The minutes of the negotiations by the commission with the Indians of the Red Lake Reservation show that the commission assured these Indians that the land which it would reserve out of that reservation would belong to them and their children; that enough land would be reserved for them and their descendants for all purposes; that no other Indians would have any right therein; and that no allotments would be made immediately out of the land reserved. The minutes further show that a line was drawn on paper which the Indians said marked the reservation which they wished to have; that after further consultations between the commissioners and the Indians the line marking the part to be reserved was agreed upon; and one of the commissioners then said there was some doubt whether the government would approve of their yielding so much, but 'we will do the best we can.' From the evidence as a whole the court below (80 Ct.Cl. 410) found that 'the statements of the commissioners at the council meeting prior to the execution of the agreement (instrument of cession) were such that the Red Lake Indians would and did understand therefrom that they were not ceding any portion of their lands which in the agreement was specified as reserved.'\n November 8, 1892, the chairman of the commission, in a letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stated in substance that the commission had used an unofficial map to guide it and the Indians in bounding and describing \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 368]\n\u00a0\n the land which was being reserved from the Red Lake Reservation; that this map was faulty and misleading in respect of the lower Red Lake around which part of the tract intended to be reserved was located; and that to 'preserve faith with the Indians' he recommended that certain described lands omitted from the reservation made by the commission 'be reserved from sale and added to said reservation.' In further support of his recommendation he said 'It was with great reluctance that they (the Indians) gave up any part of the upper lake, and if any part of the lower lake shall be taken from them they will think they were deceived or advantage taken of their ignorance.' This letter was laid before the President with approving letters from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior, and on November 21, 1892, the President made an Executive Order reserving the described lands from sale and adding them to the reservation made by the commission. The added lands comprised 2,303 acres theretofore included, apparently unintentionally, in the cession by the Red Lake Indians.\n Continuously since the making of the Executive Order the lands thereby added to the reservation made by the commission have been treated by the United States as a part of that reservation, and the reservation as thus changed or corrected has been known as the diminished Red Lake Reservation.\n No allotments in severalty have as yet been made on this diminished reservation, because the Red Lake Indians have thus far opposed the present making of such allotments and the administrative officers have not as yet considered it practicable to make them.\n By an act of February 20, 1904, c. 161, 33 Stat. 46, 48, Congress modified and adopted an agreement negotiated \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 369]\n\u00a0\n by an United States Indian inspector with the Red Lake Indians whereby the latter ceded to the United States a tract containing 256,152 acres out of the diminished Red Lake Reservation. This cession was in trust that the lands be sold by the United States and the proceeds be placed in the Treasury of the United States in a trust fund to the credit of the Red Lake Indians and be paid to them in stated installments. Articles 4 and 5 of the agreement declared:\n'It is further agreed that the said Indians belonging on the said Red Lake Reservation, Minnesota, shall possess their diminished reservation independent of all other bands of the Chippewa tribe of Indians and shall be entitled to allotments thereon of one hundred and sixty acres each, of either agricultural or pine land, the different classes of land to be apportioned as equitably as possible among the allottees.'\n\n'It is understood that nothing in this agreement shall be construed to deprive the said Indians belonging on the Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota, of any benefits to which they are entitled under existing treaties or agreements not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement. It is the intention of this agreement that the United States shall act as trustee for said Indians to dispose of said land and to expend and pay over the proceeds as received from the sale thereof only as received, as herein provided.'\n\n The United States has been holding and now holds the diminished Red Lake Reservation and all moneys derived therefrom, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Red Lake Indians, and not for the benefit of the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, who brought this suit.\n The tract reserved by the commission out of the Red Lake Reservation at the time of the cession under the act \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 370]\n\u00a0\n of 1889 contained 661,118 acres. The lands added to this reserved tract by the Executive Order of November 21, 1892, comprised 2,303 acres, making the so-called diminished Red Lake Reservation contain 663,421 acres. The tract ceded from this diminished reservation by the Red Lake Indians in the agreement embodied in the act of February 20, 1904, contained 256,152 acres.\n The number of Red Lake Indians belonging to the Red Lake Reservation was, on March 4, 1890, 1,168; on February 20, 1904, 1,418; on February 26, 1927, the date of suit, 1,736; and, in 1932, 1881.\n In many acts passed since March 4, 1890, and cited in findings 34, 35 and 36 of the court below (80 Ct.Cl. 410, 455-458), Congress has recognized the Red Lake Indians as entitled, exclusive of other Chippewas, to the diminished Red Lake Reservation and to all proceeds therefrom.\n Other matters shown in the findings will be mentioned later on.\n The claims presented by the plaintiffs' petition and pressed in the court below were overlapping in part and substantially to the effect, first, that the lands reserved by the commission out of the Red Lake Reservation were only temporarily reserved for the purpose of making allotments to the Red Lake Indians at the time, in the quantity and of the character specified in the act of 1889; that subject only to such filling of these allotments the lands reserved were included in the cession and became part of the estate which the United States was to hold in trust for the benefit of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota; and that by subsequently failing to make any allotments from the reserved lands and permanently appropriating all of them, through the act of February, 20, 1904, to the use and benefit of the Red Lake Indians, to the exclusion \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 371]\n\u00a0\n of all other Chippewas, the United States wrongfully disposed of the lands in disregard of its trust obligations and of the rights of the plaintiffs, and thereby became liable to the plaintiffs for the value of the lands, or at least for the value of such of them as were not needed to fill the allotments which were to be made from them; secondly, that by adding to the reserved lands, through the Executive Order, 2,303 acres which had been included in the cession, the United States wrongfully withdrew the added lands from the trust estate and appropriated them to the use and benefit of the Red Lake Indians, to the exclusion of all other Chippewas, thereby becoming liable to the plaintiffs for their value; and, thirdly, that by the act of February 20, 1904, the United States wrongfully took 256,152 acres of the reserved lands from the trust estate and applied them to a new and different trust for the benefit of the Red Lake Indians, to the exclusion of all other Chippewas, and thereby became liable to the plaintiffs for the value of such of them as were not sold and for the proceeds from such as were sold.\n From the findings made and from an examination of the instruments of cession and of the treaties, statutes and public documents referred to in the findings, the court below reached the conclusion that up to the time of the cession under the act of 1889 the Red Lake Indians had the full Indian title to the Red Lake Reservation, to the exclusion of all other Chippewas; that the lands reserved by the commission were not included in the cession, but explicitly reserved therefrom, and therefore the Indian title to them remained in the Red Lake Indians; that the lands which the Executive Order added to those which were so reserved were by mutual mistake included in the cession instead of being included in those reserved, and therefore the Executive Order should be regarded as having appropriately corrected that mistake \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 372]\n\u00a0\n and made effective the true intention of the parties; and that in these circumstances the plaintiffs were not injured or entitled to recover by reason of any of the matters complained of, and their petition should be dismissed.\n\n 1. \nComplaint is made of the action of the court in regarding the Indian title to the lands in the Red Lake Reservation prior to and at the time of the cession as material. Plainly the complaint is without merit. Whether the title was in the Red Lake bands alone or in all of the Minnesota bands has a material bearing on the construction and effect of the cession, and also on the question of who, after the cession, had the title to the lands reserved.\n\n 2. \nComplaint is next made of the holding that the Indian title prior to and at the time of the cession was in the Red Lake bands. While there appears to have been some diversity of opinion on this question, we are of opinion that the court's solution of it is right. For a long period the Red Lake bands had been in the exclusive occupancy of the lands in the Red Lake Reservation. None of the other Minnesota bands disputed this occupancy or the right to it. Some had in treaties relinquished all right to areas which included that reservation,7 and others had recognized the occupancy and title of the Red Lake bands by both ceding and accepting adjacent lands expressly described as bounded on 'the line of the Red Lake Reservation.' \n8\n The officers of the United States charged with the administration of Indian affairs also had recognized, repeatedly and consistently, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 373]\n\u00a0\n the occupancy and title of the Red Lake bands. Typical of such recognitions is a letter of January 8, 1889, by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, which was written with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior for the information of the President. In the letter it was said: 'None of the Indians in that State, except the Red Lake Indians, have any right, title or interest in the Red Lake Reservation.'\n The recognition of a Chippewa band as having title to a reservation occupied by it was not confined to the Red Lake bands or to the Red Lake Reservation. On the contrary, it had long been the settled rule in respect of the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota that a band or bands occupying a separate reservation should be regarded and dealt with as having the full Indian title to the lands therein. The Indians both recognized and gave effect to the rule. Many cessions were negotiated and carried out in conformity with it. The band or bands occupying a reservation ceded it in whole or in part without any participation by other bands and received and enjoyed the compensation without sharing it with others. Under the rule each of the bands existing in 1889 had theretofore made cessions and received pay therefor quite independently of the other bands. By a treaty of October 2, 1863, 13 Stat. 667, the United States negotiated a treaty with the Red Lake and Pembina bands whereby these bands ceded to the United States a described part of the lands then 'owned and claimed by them,' and the United States, in consideration of the cession, agreed to pay 'to the said Red Lake and Pembina bands' a stated sum per annum for a limited period. In Article 6 of the treaty the lands not ceded were called 'the reservation,' and thereafter were regarded by the United States and the Indians as constituting the Red Lake Reservation. \n9\n The \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 374]\n\u00a0\n treaty of 1863 was confirmed, with modifications not material here, by a treaty of April 12, 1864, with the same Indians, 13 Stat. 689. No other band participated in that cession or shared, or sought to share, in the compensation.\n This array of matters making strongly for full Indian title in the Red Lake bands prior to and at the time of the cession of 1889, encounters direct contradiction in the report made to the House of Representatives by its committee on Indian affairs when presenting the bill which, after many amendments, became the act of 1889.10 In that report it was said:\n'All of the Indians in Minnesota are members of the great Chippewa family, which has for generations occupied the northern and northeastern half of the State. There are now in all about 7,500 of these Indians, who occupy reservations and unceded lands amounting in the aggregate to about 4,700,000 acres of land. ...\n\n'The so-called Red Lake Reservation is simply a remnant of unceded Indian territory occupied at present by the Red Lake band, but really the common property, so far as the Indian title is concerned, of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota. * *\n\n'All the Chippewas in Minnesota really belong to one family, and this Red Lake Reservation is really a remnant of all that country once occupied by them in common, and thus a sort of common property.'\n\n In so far as the committee's report states that the title to the lands in the Red Lake Reservation was held in common by all of the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota, rather than by the Red Lake bands, it is at variance with \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 375]\n\u00a0\n what is otherwise indubitably shown, and evidently is based on a serious misapprehension of the real situation. It overlooks treaties wherein most of the other bands relinquished areas which included the lands in the Red Lake Reservation; takes no account of the rule, long applied by the government and the Chippewa Indians, whereby a band or bands occupying a separate reservation were regarded as having the title to the lands therein and entitled to hold or cede them independently of other bands; puts aside the treaties of 1863 and 1864 which recognized the Red Lake and Pembina bands as owning the lands occupied by them, and also as entitled to make cessions therefrom without consulting other bands; fails to consider the absence of any claim by other bands to an interest in the lands of the Red Lake Reservation; and gives no effect to a formidable body of legislative and administrative action and opinion whereby the Red Lake bands, and they alone, were uniformly recognized as both occupying and having the Indian title to the lands in that reservation. It therefore is plain that the report cannot be taken as overcoming the facts otherwise indubitably shown.\n\n 3. \nNext it is insisted that even though the Indian title was in the Red Lake bands, Congress, in section 1 of the act of 1889, declared that as to the Red Lake Reservation the cession should be sufficient if made by 'two-thirds of the male adults of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota,' and thereby enabled the Chippewas as a whole to cede that reservation, even over the objection of the Red Lake bands. To this we do not agree. Our decisions, while recognizing that the government has power to control and manage the property and affairs of its Indian wards in good faith for their welfare, show that this power is subject to constitutional limitations and does not enable the government to give the lands of one tribe or band \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 376]\n\u00a0\n to another, or to deal with them as its own. \n11\n And, of course, an act of Congress should not be given a construction which will imperil its validity where it is reasonably open to a construction free from such peril. \n12\n The provision in section 1 of the act of 1889, on which the appellants rely, is, in our opinion, reasonably open to a construction certainly consistent with its validity. The section directs the commission to negotiate with 'all the different bands' for a cession of all the reservations, except parts of two, and then provides that the cession shall be sufficient 'as to each of said several reservations, except as to the Red Lake Reservation,' if made by two-thirds of the male adults of the band occupying and belonging to such reservation, and 'as to the Red Lake Reservation' shall be sufficient if made 'by two-thirds of the male adults of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.' A fairly admissible meaning of this is that the negotiations were to be had with each and all of the bands, including those occupying the Red Lake Reservation; that the cession as to each reservation was to be by at least two-thirds of the male adults of the band occupying the same; and that as to the Red Lake Reservation the cession was to be not only by two-thirds of the male adults of the bands occupying that reservation but also by two-thirds of the male adults of all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota. To save the section from questionable validity, this meaning should be preferred to one involving a purpose to authorize a cession as to that reservation without the assent of the bands occupying it. The additional requirement as to it that the cession have the assent of two-thirds of the male adults \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 377]\n\u00a0\n of all the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota may well be regarded as precautionary and intended, in view of the statements in the committee's report, to accomplish a cession which would be effective whether the title was in the Red Lake bands, as administrative officers were holding, or was held in common by all the Minnesota Chippewas, as the committee stated. In this view of the section-which we think the right one-the act cannot be held to evince a purpose to take from one band without its assent and give to others. The Commission evidently understood the provision as we do, for they went first to the Red Lake bands and there announced that the negotiations, if not resulting in the requisite assent of those bands, would be abandoned.\n\n 4. \nIt is further insisted that the court erred in holding that none of the lands described in the instrument of cession as reserved by the commission for allotments was ceded, instead of holding that all were ceded, save those actually required to make and fill allotments at the time, in the quantity and of the character described in the act of 1889. We regard the holding as right. The act was not intended to secure a cession of all of the Red Lake Reservation, but only of so much of its as 'in the judgment of said commission' was not required to make and fill the intended allotments, and was not 'reserved by the Commissioners' for that purpose. And the allotments were to be made, not within any definite period, but 'as soon as practicable.' The instrument of cession declared that the Red Lake bands ceded all of their reservation not included within designated boundaries and that the lands embraced within those boundaries had been reserved by the commissioners for the purpose of making and filling allotments. Thus it showed what lands were ceded and what were reserved. The act committed to the 'judgment of the commission' the determination of how much and what would be required for allotments, and \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 378]\n\u00a0\n laid on the commissioners the duty of reserving lands accordingly. The instrument of cession shows that the commission attended to these tasks. Whether the tasks were performed with appropriate wisdom is not open to inquiry in this suit. The instrument of cession, showing the lands ceded and the lands reserved, was examined by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior and was then submitted to and approved by the President. With that approval it became effective. The lands which were reserved were not ceded, either by the terms of the instrument of cession or through the operation of the act. The Indian title to them remained after the cession, as before, in the Red Lake bands. The act contemplated their use in making allotments to members of those bands; but, as they were not ceded but reserved from the cession, the matter of whether and when they shall be allotted rests with the government and those bands and is not of any concern, in the sense of the law, to the other bands.\n The cession of the Red Lake Reservation by the Indians of the other reservations differs in words from that by the Red Lake bands, but we regard them as in substance identical and as conforming to the act.\n\n 5. \nError is also assigned on the court's ruling respecting the Executive Order of November 21, 1892, whereby 2,303 acres of the lands ceded under the act of 1889 were added to the lands reserved for allotments. The basis for this order, shortly stated, is that the lands so added were intended by the commission and the Indians to be included in the lands reserved and were by mutual mistake, incident to the use of an unofficial and faulty map, included among those ceded. Evidently the Red Lake bands were equitably entitled to have the mistake corrected. No intervening right stood in the way. The mistaken cession was to the United States, in trust for the ultimate benefit of Indian wards. In this situation we should hesitate a good deal before holding that the Presi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 358, 379]\n\u00a0\n dent's authority over Indian affairs is not broad enough to warrant a correction of the mistake by an Executive Order. \n13\n But, this aside, the appellants are without right to recover in respect of the lands which were the subject of the mistake. Save for it the lands would have been reserved, not included in the cession. Therefore, the appellants' interest in them through the cession and trust was colorable only, and in an appropriate proceeding, brought with the consent of the United States, the mistake could and doubtless would have been corrected.

Wood, of New York City, for petitioner Haskins Bros . & Co.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 602 1\/2 of the Revenue Act of 1934, c. 277, 48 Stat. 680, 763, 26 U.S.C.A.  999, imposes a tax of 3 cents per pound upon the first domestic processing of coconut oil, and provides that all such taxes collected with respect to coconut oil wholly of Philippine production, etc ., 'shall be held as a separate fund and paid to the Treasury of the Philippine Islands, but if at any time the Philippine Government provides by any law for any subsidy to be paid to the pro- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n ducers of copra, coconut oil, or allied products, no further payments to the Philippine Treasury shall be made under this subsection.'\n Both petitioners are engaged in manufacturing soap and, at times stated in their petitions, used in its manufacture large quantities of coconut oil wholly the product of the Philippine Islands. In pursuance of section 602 1\/2, they made returns and paid the amount of the tax as required by that section. Subsequently, each of them filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue a claim for the refund of the tax, on the ground that the imposition was not within the constitutional power of Congress. Both claims were denied, and petitions at law were filed in federal district courts to recover the sums paid. Demurrers were interposed attacking the sufficiency of the petitions, and these demurrers were sustained by the trial courts. Appeals were taken to the respective circuit courts of appeal named in the title; and we granted writs of certiorari before a hearing or submission in those courts, because of the importance to the Philippine Islands of an early final decision of the question. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 649\n, 57 S.Ct. 493, 81 L.Ed. --; Haskins Bros. & Co. v. O'Malley, \n300 \nU.S. 649\n, 57 S.Ct. 494, 81 L.Ed. --.\n The validity of the tax is assailed by petitioners upon a variety of grounds, developed at length in their respective briefs and by the oral arguments at the bar. So far as we find it necessary to consider the various contentions, they may be stated in general terms as follows: That the tax is not imposed for any purpose contemplated by the taxing clause of section 8, art. 1, of the Federal Constitution-that is to say, it is not imposed to pay the debts or provide for the common defense or general welfare of the United States; that, on the contrary, it is imposed for a purely local purpose, in violation of the Tenth Amendment; that the exaction violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it is an arbitrary exaction from one group of persons for the exclusive benefit \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n of another; that the act does not impose a true tax, but is a regulatory measure outside the field of federal power; that it violates clause 7,  9, of art. 1 of the Constitution, which provides that 'No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law'; that the payment in bulk of the entire proceeds of the tax to the Philippines, with no direction as to the expenditure thereof, constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative power. In dealing with these contentions, we find it convenient to do so without following the precise order in which they have just been stated. And certain of them are so interrelated that they may be joined for consideration in the same subdivision of the opinion which follows.\n First. Plainly, the imposition of the tax in itself is a valid exercise of the taxing power of the federal government. It is purely an excise tax upon a manufacturing process for revenue purposes, and in no sense a regulation of the process itself. The Tenth Amendment is without application, since the powers of the several states over local affairs are not invaded or involved. This is disclosed upon the face of the act so clearly that discussion could not make it plainer. United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914, relied upon by petitioner, is not in point. There we held that the sole aim of the statute, as shown by its terms, was to regulate a local situation, a matter wholly within the reserved powers of the states; and moreover that it amounted to a naked taking of the property of one group of persons for bestowal upon another group. The Child Labor Tax Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S. Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432, and other cases cited, bear still more remotely upon the contention. It is enough to say that the feature of the present case which differentiates it from all those cited is that the exaction here, both in form and substance, is a true tax, imposed, as we presently shall show, for a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n federal constitutional purpose. In that view the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is not involved.\n Second. Standing apart, therefore, the tax is unassailable. It is said to be bad because it is earmarked and devoted from its inception to a specific purpose. But if the tax, qua tax, be good, as we hold it is, and the purpose specified be one which would sustain a subsequent and separate appropriation made out of the general funds of the Treasury, neither is made invalid by being bound to the other in the same act of legislation. The only concern which we have in that aspect of the matter is to determine whether the purpose specified is one for which Congress can make an appropriation without violating the fundamental law. If Congress, for reasons deemed by it to be satisfactory, chose to adopt the quantum of receipts from this particular tax as the measure of the appropriation, we perceive no valid basis for challenging its power to do so.\n We inquire first: Is the proposed appropriation to the Philippine Treasury for a constitutional purpose? since an affirmative answer to that question will establish the constitutional purpose of the tax. The pertinent taxing clause provides in general terms (article 1,  8, cl. 1) that taxes may be laid 'to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.' Primarily, and in a very high degree, whether a tax serves any of these purposes is a practical question addressed to the lawmaking department. And it will require a very plain case to warrant the courts in setting aside the conclusion of Congress in that regard. Compare Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509\n, 514-516, 19 S.Ct. 522. Nevertheless, such plain cases may exist; and the question is whether this is one of them.\n The Philippine Islands and their inhabitants, from the beginning of our occupation, have borne a peculiar \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 314]\n\u00a0\n relation to the United States. The Islands constitute a dependency over which the United States, for more than a generation, has had and exercised supreme power of legislation and administration, Posadas v. National City Bank, \n296 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 56 S.Ct. 349, 351, a power limited only by the terms of the treaty of cession and those principles of the Constitution which by their nature are inherently inviolable. The possession of this well-nigh absolute power over a dependent people carries with it great obligations, as was pointed out by Mr. Root as Secretary of War in 1899. After referring to the practically unlimited power which we had over the Philippines, he said: 'I assume, also, that the obligations correlative to this great power are of the highest character, and that it is our unquestioned duty to make the interests of the people over whom we assert sovereignty the first and controlling consideration in all legislation and administration which concerns them, and to give them, to the greatest possible extent, individual freedom, self-government in accordance with their capacity, just and equal laws, and opportunity for education, for profitable industry, and for development in civilization.' Military and Colonial Policy of the United States, 161, 162.\n Among these correlative duties is the moral obligation to protect, defend, and provide for the general welfare of, the inhabitants. And such an obligation well may require the appropriation and expenditure of money from the national purse-in which case the obligation fairly comes within the term 'debts' as used in the taxing clause. United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427, 440\n, 441 S., 16 S.Ct. 1120, 1125. Congress, from the beginning of its existence, has accepted and legislated upon that view of the broad meaning of the term. In innumerable instances, it has made appropriations to relieve needs caused by earthquakes, fire, and other events, not only in localities \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 315]\n\u00a0\n within or possessed by the United States, but in foreign countries as well. Government counsel has furnished us an impressive list of appropriations of this character; and in addition has called attention to the many instances of appropriations for the support and welfare of the Indians, and for the uses of the territories. Legislation of this character has been so long continued and its validity so long unquestioned that, as we said in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304, 322\n, 327 S., 328, 57 S.Ct. 216, 224: 'A legislative practice such as we have here, evidenced not by only occasional instances, but marked by the movement of a steady stream for a century and a half of time, goes a long way in the direction of proving the presence of unassailable ground for the constitutionality of the practice, to be found in the origin and history of the power involved, or in its nature, or in both combined.'\n It may be that the tax and the appropriation of the proceeds therefrom in the present instance could be justified as an exercise of the taxing power to provide, in a broad sense, for the public defense or the general welfare of the United States. We do not pause to consider that view; for plainly, we think, the law may be sustained as an act in discharge of a high moral obligation, amounting to a 'debt' within the meaning of the Constitution as it always has been practically construed. The justification for that conclusion has been so fully stated by this court in the case of United States v. Realty Co., supra, that further citation becomes unnecessary. 'Under the provisions of the Constitution ( article 1,  8),' we there said, 'Congress has power to lay and collect taxes, etc., 'to pay the debts' of the United States. Having power to raise money for that purpose, it of course follows that it has power, when the money is raised, to appropriate it to the same object. What are the debts of the United \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 316]\n\u00a0\n States within the meaning of this constitutional provision? It is conceded, and, indeed, it cannot be questioned, that the debts are not limited to those which are evidenced by some written obligation, or to those which are otherwise of a strictly legal character. The term 'debts' includes those debts or claims which rest upon a merely equitable or honorary obligation, and which would not be recoverable in a court of law if existing against an individual. The nation, speaking broadly, owes a 'debt' to an individual when his claim grows out of general principles of right and justice,-when, in other words, it is based upon considerations of a moral or merely honorary nature, such as are binding on the conscience or the honor of an individual, although the debt could obtain no recognition in a court of law. The power of congress extends, at least, as far as the recognition and payment of claims against the government which are thus founded. To no other branch of the government than congress could any application be successfully made, on the part of the owners of such claims or debts, for the payment thereof. Their recognition depends solely upon congress, and whether it will recognize claims thus founded must be left to the discretion of that body. Payments to individuals, not of right, or of a merely legal claim, but payments in the nature of a gratuity, yet having some feature of moral obligation to support them, have been made by the government, by virtue of acts of congress appropriating the public money, ever since its foundation. Some of the acts were based upon considerations of pure charity. A long list of acts directing payments of the above general character is appended to the brief of one of the counsel for the defendants in error. The acts are referred to, not for the purpose of asserting their validity in all cases, but as evidence of what has been the practice of congress since the adoption of the constitution. See, also, among \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 317]\n\u00a0\n other cases in this court, Emerson v. Hall, 13 Pet. 409 (10 L.Ed. 223); United States v. Price, \n116 \nU.S. 43\n, 6 S.Ct. 235 (29 L.Ed. 541); Williams v. Heard, \n140 \nU.S. 529\n, 11 S.Ct. 885 (35 L.Ed. 550). The last-cited case arose under an act of congress in relation to the Alabama claims.'\n Later decisions of this court have followed that view. United States v. Cook, \n257 \nU.S. 525\n, 42 S.Ct. 200; Marion & R.V. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 280, 284\n, 46 S.Ct. 253, 255. The determination of Congress to recognize the moral obligation of the nation to make an appropriation as a requirement of justice and honor, is obviously a matter of policy and discretion not open to judicial review unless in circumstances which here we are not able to find. United States v. Realty Co., supra, \n163 \nU.S. 427\n, at page 444, 16 S.Ct. 1120.\n It does not follow that because a federal tax levied for the express purpose of paying the debts or providing for the welfare of a state might be invalid (Passenger Cases (Smith v. Turner), 7 How. 283, 446) that such a tax for the uses of a territory or dependency would likewise be invalid. A state, except as the federal Constitution otherwise requires, is supreme and independent. It has its own government, with full powers of taxation and full power to appropriate the revenues derived therefrom. A dependency has no government but that of the United States, except in so far as the United States may permit. The national government may do for one of its dependencies whatever a state might do for itself or one of its political subdivisions, since over such a dependency the nation possesses the sovereign powers of the general government plus the powers of a local or a state government in all cases where legislation is possible. Compare Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, \n129 \nU.S. 141, 147\n, 9 S.Ct. 256; National Bank v. County of Yankton, \n101 \nU.S. 129\n, 133; Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ, etc., v. United States, \n136 \nU.S. 1, 42\n, 10 S.Ct. 792; Utter v. Franklin, \n172 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 19 S.Ct. 183. To say that the federal government, with such practically unlimited powers of legislation in respect of a dependency, is yet \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 318]\n\u00a0\n powerless to appropriate money for its needs, is to deny-what the foregoing considerations forbid us to deny-that the United States has, in that regard, the equivalent power of a state in comparable circumstances.\n Third. In the exercise of its plenary powers, the United States began by governing the Philippine Islands under the war power. Following the Treaty of Paris, a condition of armed insurrection persisted for some time. In 1900, military government was succeeded by a species of executive government. The Spooner Amendment to the Army Appropriation Bill of March 2, 1901, c. 803, 31 Stat. 895, 910, provided that: 'All military, civil, and judicial powers necessary to govern the Philippine Islands ... shall, until otherwise provided by Congress, be vested in such person and persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the United States shall direct, for the establishment of civil government and for maintaining and protecting the inhabitants of said islands in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion.'\n This was followed, March 5, 1901, by a cable from the Secretary of War to the Philippine Commission containing the following laconic order: 'Until further orders government will continue under existing instructions and orders.' Report, Secretary of War, 1901, p. 54. The comprehensive Spooner Amendment, and these instructions and orders, virtually constituted for many months the charter of government for the Philippine Islands. In 1902, Congress provided for a complete system of civil government under the original Philippine Organic Act (32 Stat. 691). By degrees, the active powers of the dependency have been enlarged, and those of the federal government decreased. But the authority which conferred additional power might at any time have withdrawn it. This brief resume demonstrates both the completeness and flexibil- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 319]\n\u00a0\n ity of the national power over the Philippines, and the high character of the moral obligations which the possession of such power correlatively imposes. With the extension of power to the islands, our moral obligations may have grown less; but whether, or to what extent, this has been the case is a question for the determination of the political departments of the government.\n But it is contended that the passage of the Philippine Independence Act of March 24, 1934, c. 84, 48 Stat. 456 (48 U.S.C.A.  1231 et seq.), and the adoption and approval of a constitution for the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands have created a different situation; and that since then, whatever may have been the case before, the United States has been under no duty to make any financial contribution to the islands. Undoubtedly, these acts have brought about a profound change in the status of the islands and in their relations to the United States; but the sovereignty of the United States has not been, and, for a long time, may not be, finally withdrawn. So far as the United States is concerned, the Philippine Islands are not yet foreign territory. By express provision of the Independence Act, we still retain powers with respect to our trade relations with the islands, with certain exceptions set forth particularly in the act. We retain powers with respect to their financial operations and their currency; and we continue to control their foreign relations. The power of review by this court over Philippine cases, as now provided by law, is not only continued, but is extended to all cases involving the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands.\n Thus, while the power of the United States has been modified, it has not been abolished. Moral responsibilities well may accompany the process of separation from this country; and, indeed, they may have been intensified by the new and perplexing problems which the Phil- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 320]\n\u00a0\n ippine people now will be called upon to meet as one of its results. The existence and character of the consequent obligations and the extent of the relief, if any, which should be afforded by the United States in respect of them, are matters, not for judicial but for congressional consideration and determination.\n It is not improbable that a failure to exercise control over imports from the Philippines would injuriously affect the industries of this country; and, on the other hand, an exercise of the power to tax imports might prove injurious to the people of the islands. Congress, in passing the legislation here under consideration, is not forbidden to balance these respective probabilities. The tax itself, it is said, was imposed for the purpose of protecting certain industries in this country; and it is challenged on that ground. That Congress has power to levy a tax with the collateral purpose of thereby protecting the industries of the United States is no longer open to doubt. Hampton & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 411\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, 352. But, in exercising the power here with that purpose, Congress may have concluded that it would thereby impose a hardship upon the Philippines which it was the moral duty of Congress to redress so far as possible. In that situation, we see no constitutional objection to a discharge of the duty by the appropriation of an amount equivalent to the tax in order to offset the anticipated burden. Certainly, this court cannot judicially declare that justice and fair dealing in respect of a people, not yet completely independent of our authority, does not warrant such action.\n Nor do we see any objection to the plan because the payment of the funds is subject to the condition that the Philippine Government shall not provide for any subsidy to be paid to the Philippine producers of coconut oil and the other products named in section 602 1\/2 of the act. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 321]\n\u00a0\n It is perfectly plain that since Congress may levy the tax with the collateral purpose of protecting the industries of this country, it may in appropriating the proceeds put such restriction upon their use as will prevent the purpose from being nullified. This, we think, is the aim and the effect of the proviso.\n Fourth. The contention that there has been no constitutional appropriation, or that any attempted appropriation is bad, because the particular uses to which the appropriated money are to be put have not been specified, is without merit. The provision of the Constitution ( clause 7,  9, art. 1) that, 'No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,' was intended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the Executive department, and is without significance here. It means simply that no money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress. Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, 291; 2 Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.)  1348, 1349; 1 Willoughby on the Constitution,  63, p. 105. We deem it unnecessary to elaborate the point. The petitions for certiorari, filed in January of the present year, inform us that none of the proceeds of the tax in question has been transmitted to the Philippine Treasury. Evidently the moneys in the form of a trust fund, as the government asserts, are still in the Treasury of the United States. If Congress has not made an appropriation, it may still do so (Head Money Cases (Edye v. Robertson), \n112 \nU.S. 580\n, 599-600, 5 S.Ct. 247); and, all other considerations aside, the interjection of the question into the present cases is premature.\n The validity of the act disposing of the tax is also attacked as constituting an unlawful delegation of legislative power. That Congress has wide discretion in the matter of prescribing details of expenditures for which \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 322]\n\u00a0\n it appropriates must, of course, be plain. Appropriation and other acts of Congress are replete with instances of general appropriations of large amounts, to be allotted and expended as directed by designated government agencies. A striking and pertinent example is afforded by the Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, where all moneys received from the sale and disposal of public lands in a large number of states and territories are set aside as a special fund to be expended for the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands within those states and territories. The expenditures are to be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior upon such projects as he may determine to be practicable and advisable. The constitutionality of this delegation of authority has never been seriously questioned. See United States v. Hanson (C.C.A.) 167 F. 881, 884, 885. In the present case, the disposition of the proceeds of the tax finds precedent in many previous acts of Congress providing for payments into the Philippine Treasury. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n But all this aside, the important point is that Congress was here dealing with a dependency for which it had provided a complete system of government to administer the affairs of a population for whose welfare the United States was under a high degree of moral responsibility, as we already have seen. The proceeds of the tax under consideration are to be paid into the treasury of a government which Congress itself thus created, to be expended by that government, except as the act otherwise directs, in accordance with its judgment as to specific necessities. The congressional power of delegation to such a local government is and must be as comprehensive as the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 323]\n\u00a0\n needs. Compare United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370, 384\n, 385 S., 27 S.Ct. 742, 11 Ann.Cas. 688. In dealing with the territories, possessions and dependencies of the United States, this nation has all the powers of other sovereign nations, and Congress in legislating is not subject to the same restrictions which are imposed in respect of laws for the United States considered as a political body of states in union. Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138, 140\n, 142 S., 24 S.Ct. 808, 1 Ann.Cas. 697.\n Congress has power to create a local legislature for the Philippines; and it has done so. Congress has power to authorize the legislature to impose taxes for all the lawful needs of the islands, and to appropriate the proceeds for such uses and in such amounts as the legislature may determine (compare Leitensdorfer v. Webb, 20 How. 176, 182); and this it has done. Congress has power to appropriate the moneys here in question, and cause them to be paid from the national treasury into the Treasury of the Philippine Islands; and for this it has provided. It would result in a strange anomaly now to hold that Congress had power to devolve upon the Philippine Government the authority to appropriate revenue derived from local taxation as the government saw fit, but that Congress was without power to confer similar authority in respect of moneys which lawfully will come into the Philippine Treasury from the Treasury of the United States or from other sources apart from taxation. It is true, as already appears, that the uses to which the money is to be put are not specified. But in all instances where funds shall come into the Philippine Treasury, we may indulge the presumption, in favor of a responsible and duly-constituted legislative body, that the funds will be appropriated for public purposes and not for private uses.\n Whether the payment to the Philippines of the large sums of money which will flow from this tax is unwarranted in fact; whether the present or prospective needs \n\n[301 \nU.S. 308, 324]\n\u00a0\n of the islands require it; and other queries directly or indirectly challenging the wisdom or necessity of the congressional action, are all matters, as we repeatedly have pointed out, with which the courts have nothing to do. We find the legislation to be free from constitutional infirmity; and there both our power and responsibility end.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Act March 8, 1902, c. 140, 32 Stat. 54; Act Aug. 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 84, 85; Act Oct. 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 193; Act Sept. 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 935; Act of June 17, 1930, c. 497, 46 Stat. 590, 686, 26 U.S.C.A.  1463 and note. \n\n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY BANK FARMERS TRUST CO. v.

Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 464\n, 57 S.Ct. 307) involving the construction and validity of provisions of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act1 which enlarge the category of provable claims to include one by a landlord for injury due to rejection of a lease, or for damages or indemnity under a lessee's covenant. \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n Florence H. Bugbee, the petitioner's assignor, leased to United Cigar Stores Company of America premises in Trenton, N.J., for a term commencing April 1, 1926, and ending March 31, 1946. August 29, 1932, the lessee was adjudicated a bankrupt upon its own petition. November 11, 1932, the respondent, as trustee in bankruptcy, rejected the lease and abandoned the premises, a portion of which had been sublet by the bankrupt. Without notice to the Cigar Stores Company the landlord relet portions of the building to subtenants in possession and let other portions to new tenants.\n June 9, 1934, two days after the passage and effective date of section 77B, the Cigar Stores Company, as permitted by subsection (p), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(p), filed in the pending bankruptcy proceeding its petition for reorganization. In the latter cause the petitioner presented a proof of claim for injury resulting from the rejection of the lease. The trustee objected to the claim and asked to have it expunged for the reason that the lease incorporated no covenant to indemnify the lessor for loss of rents or other provision enabling her to hold the tenant for damages or for rent accruing subsequent to termination of the leasehold estate, and asserted the leasehold had been terminated and all obligations of the debtor under the lease extinguished by the landlord's re-entry and reletting.\n The special master who heard the cause recommended disallowance of the claim in the view that section 77B did not, and could not, create any valid and legal claims against the debtor where none existed anterior to the enactment of the section, and held that none existed before its adoption because by the law of New Jersey, the landlord's re-entry and reletting worked a surrender of the leasehold. In his report the master referred to the fact that the record in the earlier bankruptcy proceeding disclosed a claim filed by the landlord, upon which dividends had been paid, for expenditures in restoring a party wall and closing up a \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n common entrance in the leased building based upon the debtor's agreement to restore it at the expiration of the term, which was again asserted in the present proceeding. He thus commented upon this situation: 'Naturally, the entire basis of this claim for restoration is the expiration of the lease. The Trustee may well point to it, as showing that the Landlord, prior to the enactment of section 77B, by her re-entry and reletting of the premises as aforesaid, considered that the lease terminated and expired.'\n The District Court approved the master's report and rejected the claim; and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,2 holding that the injury specified in section 77B(b)(10), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10) for which a claim by a landlord is allowable can only be such injury as would found an action under applicable state law. The court concluded that although according to the law of New Jersey the re-entry and reletting did not effect a surrender, the restoration of the building was such an assertion of dominion by the landlord as to deprive her of any further claim against the tenant.\n The parties differ with respect to the correctness of the Circuit Court of Appeals' interpretation of the law of New Jersey. They also disagree as to whether the record supports the finding that the landlord restored a portion of the leased building. The disputes need not be resolved if the petitioner is right in asserting that, within the purview of section 77B, the lessor was a person injured by the rejection of the lease who is accorded a provable claim against the debtor's estate for the injury, notwithstanding the re-entry, reletting, and restoration of the premises, after rejection of the lease, consummated a surrender of the leasehold, and ended the tenant's liability under the local law. As section 77B supplements and extends the bankruptcy system in force at the time of its enactment, we \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n shall examine the question in the light of the old law, the supposed mischief arising under it and the alterations made by the later act.\n\n 1. \nSection 63a of the Bankruptcy Act of 18983 stated what claims should be provable in bankruptcy. The section gave a landlord no provable claim for rent to accrue after the trustee's rejection of a lease. The tenant's liability for future rent was not discharged and remained enforceable as installments of rent fell due. This was necessarily so, since future rent is demandable only in the amounts and at the times named in the lease and the total cannot be recovered at law in a lump sum in advance of accrual of the installments. This state of the law involved elements of hardship to both lessor and lessee. In the case of a corporate, and often in that of an individual lessee, the landlord's right to collect rent from a bankrupt tenant was valueless. On the other hand, if the landlord, notwithstanding rejection by the trustee, was compelled by its terms, or elected pursuant to its provisions, to treat the lease as still in force, he might throughout the remainder of the term harass the discharged bankrupt by successive actions for accruing rent and so retard or prevent the debtor's financial rehabilitation which the statute was intended to aid.\n Many leases provide for the termination of the tenant's estate upon his adjudication as a bankrupt, by the lessor's re-entry. Under the old law such termination did not give rise to a provable claim for future rent, or for damages, or for indemnity. Not uncommonly lease agreements, in addition to stipulation for termination of the leasehold upon the tenant's bankruptcy, provide that the bankrupt shall indemnify the landlord for loss of future rent. These provisions vary in their terms, some requiring the rendition of indemnity as each installment \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n of rent falls due, others at the end of the term when the full difference between the rent reserved and that received upon reletting can be ascertained. Under section 63a of the Act of 1898 such covernants did not support a provable claim, as the obligation to indemnify ripened after adjudication. The consequence was that liability under this sort of covenant was not discharged and remained to haunt the bankrupt.\n As early as 1932 proposals were brought forward in Congress for the broadening of the bankruptcy system to authorize proceedings for the reorganization of business corporations. Bills authorizing proceedings in courts of bankruptcy to that end failed of passage in the 72d and 73d Congress. H.R. 5884, 73d Congress, Second Session, which ultimately became law as section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act was under consideration when the decision in Manhattan Properties, Inc., v. Irving Trust Company, \n291 \nU.S. 320\n, 54 S.Ct. 385, threw into high relief the plight in which landlords found themselves as a result of the flood of corporate bankruptcies brought about by the economic depression. The situation of owners of business properties leased to chain store organizations which had resorted to voluntary bankruptcy largely as a lever to force revision of leases was the subject of comment in and out of Congress. By the same act section 6oa was amended (48 Stat. 923,  4(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  103 and note) to give a provable claim to a landlord whose lease had been rejected by a trustee in bankruptcy and a similar provision was incorporated in 77B, the new reorganization section. This history cannot be ignored in construing the supplemental legislation.\n\n 2. \nThe purpose of section 77B was to facilitate rehabilitation of embarrassed corporations by a scaling or rearrangement of their obligations and shareholders' interests, thus avoiding a winding up, a sale of assets, and a distribution of the proceeds. A salient element in such a reorganization is the discharge of all demands of whatsoever sort, executory and contingent, presently due or to mature \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n in the future. Of such claims not the least important are those for rent to accrue under a lease, or for damages or indemnity payable because of the termination of a leasehold. Obviously if such obligations are to be discharged they must be made provable, for they cannot be destroyed. How, then, did the Congress deal with them?\n The pertinent provisions of section 77B are copied in the margin. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n Clause 10 renders provable claims upon covenants of indemnity maturing upon re-entry after adjudication. The term 'creditors' is made to include 'holders of claims of whatever character against the debtor or its property, including claims under executory contracts, whether or not such claims would otherwise constitute provable claims under this Act (title).' Bankruptcy of the obligor is an anticipatory breach of an executory contract and a claim for damages for the breach was provable under section 63a of the Act of 1898.5 One having a demand against a debtor whose affairs are in the hands of an equity receiver, if the claim matured after the receiver's appointment but before the expiration of the period fixed for presentation of claims, is entitled to prove and to share in distribution;6 but the rule in bankruptcy has been that the claim under an executory contract must mature at or before the filing of the petition. \n7\n The language which is italicized in the foregoing quotation from clause 10 can have no other meaning than that claims upon covenants for damages or indemnity arising out of the termination of a lease after initiation of proceedings under section 77B are provable. The provision, however, creates no new claim. It merely treats the adjudication as a breach of covenant and gives a provable claim in virtue of the breach.\n Since in the instant case the lease contains no such covenant, in the absence of some further provision respecting landlords' claims the petitioner would be without remedy under section 77B as it would have been in strict bank \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy proceedings under section 63a of the Act of 1898 (11 U.S.C.A.  103( a) until that section was amended in 1934. There is, however, a further provision: 'In case an executory contract or unexpired lease of real estate shall be rejected pursuant to direction of the judge (see subsection (c)(5), 11 U.S.C.A.  207(c) (5)) given in a proceeding instituted under this section, or shall have been rejected by a trustee or receiver in bankruptcy or receiver in equity, in a proceeding pending prior to the institution of a proceeding under this section any person injured by such rejection shall, for all purposes of this section and of the reorganization plan, its acceptance and confirmation, be deemed to be a creditor.' 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10). Under the old law the rejection of a lease by a trustee in bankruptcy was not a breach of the lease, in the absence of a specific agreement that it should be so. The bankrupt tenant remained liable for the rent as it fell due but all the assets wherewith he might pay were taken from him. For a default in payment subsequent to adjudication the landlord might reenter and terminate the lease. By virtue of a covenant so providing the landlord might treat the bankruptcy as cause for reentry and termination of the leasehold estate. While, therefore, the rejection of a lease by a trustee in bankruptcy might, and usually did, spell possible or probable injury to the landlord, that fact gave him no standing as a creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding. Having in mind this state of affairs the purpose is clearly to give a landlord a provable claim for injury due to the rejection of his lease, whether the instrument contains a covenant of indemnity or not.\n Although, as we have noted, under the Act of 1898 rejection by the trustee was not a breach of the lease, it left the premises in the possession of an impecunious tenant with the virtual certainty they would be thrown back upon the landlord's hands untenanted. If the owner could not turn his property to account on terms as favorable as those embodied in the rejected lease obviously he suffered an injury. \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n The opinion in the Manhattan Properties Case, supra, adverts to the fact that for many years the English bankruptcy acts have given a remedy for the loss of future rents due to supervening bankruptcy and sequent rejection of the lease. 8 Congress was familiar with this fact when section 77B was under discussion. \n9\n The analogous provisions of the English acts while differently phrased are of the same purport as those of section 77B. \n10\n Congress intended to supply the omission of the Act of 1898 and to create a claim provable in a reorganization proceeding for injury due to a trustee's rejection. This conclusion finds further support in the succeeding sentence, which in limiting the amount allowable upon these claims, refers to them in three aspects, thus: 'The claim of a landlord for injury resulting from the rejection of an unexpired lease of real estate or for damages or indemnity under a covenant contained in such lease,' etc. 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10).\n\n 3. \nLike any other provable claim, that of a landlord for injury resulting from rejection of the lease, or for damages or indemnity for termination of the tenure, may, for an adequate consideration, be released. Schwartz v. Irving Trust Company, \n299 \nU.S. 456\n, 57 S.Ct. 303. The lease, moreover, may contain stipulations, fulfillment of which is to be full compensation for any loss due to termination of the leasehold \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n and thus bar any claim under 77B for the landlord's loss. Meadows v. Irving Trust Company, \n299 \nU.S. 464\n, 57 S.Ct. 307.\n\n 4. \nThe question for decision in this case is whether the claim recognized by section 77B, which would not have been an enforceable demand at common law, or under the laws of many of the states, is allowable only if the leasehold estate has not, after rejection of the lease, been drowned by surrender effective under state law or otherwise terminated pursuant to state law by the lessor's conduct.\n We think it clear that provability of such a claim is unaffected by any termination of the leasehold subsequent to rejection of the lease. The provision is that the landlord's claim for injury resulting from rejection, or for damages, or for indemnity under a covenant, shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the rent reserved 'for the three years next succeeding the date of surrender of the premises to the landlord or the date of re-entry of the landlord, whichever first occurs, whether before or after the filing of the petition.' 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10). Plainly the word 'reentry' is used to describe a case where the landlord, treating the bankruptcy as a breach of the lease, re-enters for condition broken. Whether the other phrase, 'surrender of the premises to the landlord,' denotes the technical surrender which drowns the particular estate in the reversion, or the mere tradition to, and acceptance by, the landlord of possession, is immaterial. The amount of the landlord's claim for the loss of his lease necessarily is the difference between the rental value of the remainder of the term and the rent reserved, both discounted to present worth. This, we have said, is a method of liquidation familiar and fair. It was the method adopted under section 77B in Kuehner v. Irving Trust Company et al. (C.C.A.) 88 F.(2d) 35, the judgment in which is this day affirmed. Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 445\n, 57 S.Ct. 298. If the landlord must give credit for the present rental value of the premises he is \n\n[299 U.S. 433, 444]\n\u00a0\n entitled to avail himself of them for realization of that value, and this he cannot do without re-entry and reletting. If he must give such credit he surely has the option to attempt recoupment of his loss by occupying the premises for the remainder of the term. But such occupation, under the law of most of the states, amounts to a complete termination of the leasehold and deprives the landlord of any further rights as lessor. It is evident that if a lease be rejected the subsequent repossession of the demised premises, and acts of control and dominion do not destroy the provability of a claim under section 77B.\n It is suggested that if a landlord desires to avail himself to the privilege accorded by the section, he must keep the leasehold estate intact until his claim shall have been proved and allowed. In view, however, of the obvious intent of the statute to extend relief not only to landlords whose leases may in future be rejected, but also to those whose leases have been rejected in prior bankruptcy or equity proceedings, such a construction would ill accord with the remedial purposes of the act, which demand a liberal construction in favor of the claimants for whom relief was intended.\n We conclude that the petitioner's claim should have been allowed. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Added to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 by Act of June 7, 1934, c. 424 ,  1, 48 Stat. 912, as amended by Act of Aug. 20, 1935, c. 577, 49 Stat. 664, and Act of Aug. 29, 1935, c. 809, 49 Stat. 965, 11 U.S.C.  207 (11 U.

The court granted a rule to show cause and, after hearing counsel for the parties, held petitioner lawfully sentenced and discharged the rule. 325 Pa. 305, 188 A. 841. The petition for writ of certiorari asserts that this decision conflicts with State v. Lewin, 53 Kan. 679, 37 P. 168; In re Mallon, 16 Idaho 737, 102 P. 374, 22 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1123, and State v. Johnsey, 46 Okl.Cr. 233, 287 P. 729. The statutes condemned in the Kansas and Idaho cases differ essentially from the Pennsylvania statute upheld in this case. Finding conflict between the decision below and that in the Oklahoma case, we granted the writ. Judicial Code  237(b), as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  344( b); \n301 \nU.S. 675\n, 57 S.Ct. 924\n\n\n The challenged provision, found in the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 382, declares (section 3 (18 P.S.Pa.  251)) that 'if any prisoner \n\n[302 \nU.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n imprisoned in any penitentiary ... upon a conviction for a criminal offense ... shall break such penitentiary ... such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction of said offense, shall be sentenced to undergo an imprisonment, to commence from the expiration of his original sentence, of the like nature, and for a period of time not exceeding the original sentence, by virtue of which he was imprisoned, when he so broke prison and escaped ...'\n In 1929, petitioner pleaded guilty of the crimes of burglary and larceny and was sentenced to the Western Penitentiary for a term of from three to six years. In December, 1931, he broke out, and, after capture and conviction, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of the same length as, and to commence at the expiration of the original sentence.\n To illustrate the inequalities between sentences permissible under the challenged provision, petitioner emphasizes the fact that, if two or more convicts escape together under the same circumstances, they may be sentenced for different terms. In fact, the record shows that petitioner escaped simultaneously with one McCann and that upon conviction for the same crime the latter was sentenced to serve a term equal to his original sentence, from one to two years.\n But the fact that terms of imprisonment may differ as do original sentences does not warrant condemnation of the statute. The law has long recognized a relation between punishment for breach of prison and the offense for which the prisoner is held, and it has more severely punished prison breaking by one undergoing imprisonment for grievous crime than if done by one held for a lesser offense. Prior to the statute de frangentibus prisonam of 1 Edw. II (1307) every prison breaking by the offender himself, whatever the crime for which he was committed, was a felony, punishable by 'judgment of life \n\n[302 \nU.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n or member.' This severity was mitigated by the statute. It forbade that judgment unless the breaking was by one committed for a capital offense. \n1\n Breach and escape by one held for felony continued to be dealt with as felony; but, if committed by one confined for an inferior offense, was punishable as a high misdemeanor by fine and imprisonment. \n2\n In harmony with that idea a number of States deal with that offense more severely when committed by one imprisoned for a heinous offense or a long term. \n3\n Indeed, this Court has sustained classification for punishment of crimes by convicts upon the basis of the sentences being served at the time. In Finley v. California, \n222 \nU.S. 28\n, 32 S.Ct. 13, it held that a statute prescribing the death penalty for the commission by life prisoners of assaults with intent to kill, lesser punishments being laid upon other convicts, was not repugnant to the equal protection clause.\n The principle is similar to that under which punishment of like crimes may be made more severe if committed by ex-convicts. Persistence in crime and failure \n\n[302 \nU.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n of earlier discipline effectively to deter or reform justify more drastic treatment. Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 \nU.S. 616, 623\n, 32 S.Ct. 583; McDonald v. Massachusetts, \n180 \nU.S. 311\n, 21 S.Ct. 389; Moore v. Missouri, \n159 \nU.S. 673, 677\n, 16 S.Ct. 179; Plumbly v. Commonwealth, 2 Metc. (Mass.) 413, 415; People v. Sickles, 156 N.Y. 541, 547, 51 N.E. 288. Save as limited by constitutional provisions safeguarding individual rights, a State may choose means to protect itself and its people against criminal violation of its laws. The comparative gravity of criminal offenses and whether their consequences are more or less injurious are matters for its determination. Collins v. Johnston, \n237 \nU.S. 502, 510\n, 35 S.Ct. 649; Howard v. Fleming, \n191 \nU.S. 126, 135\n, 136 S., 24 S.Ct. 49. It may inflict a deserved penalty merely to vindicate the law or to deter or to reform the offender or for all of these purposes. For the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender. His past may be taken to indicate his present purposes and tendencies and significantly to suggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline that ought to be imposed upon him.\n Presumably, the sentence bring served at the time of prison breaking was determined upon due consideration of the pertinent facts. The judgment then pronounced is good evidence of the convict's natural or acquired vent of mind and his attitude toward the law and rights of others. The fact that he would and did break prison shows him still disposed to evil and determined to remain hostile to society. And that is sufficient to sustain the classification made by the Pennsylvania statute for punishment of prison breakers on the basis of their original sentences.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That none from henceforth that breaketh prison shall have judgment of life or member for breaking of prison only, except the cause for which he was taken and imprisoned did require such judgment, if he had been convict thereupon according to the law and custom of the realm, albeit in times past it hath been used otherwise.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 4 Blackstone, p. 130; 1 Hale's Pleas of the Crown, c. 54; 2 Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, c. 18; 2 Wharton Criminal Law (12th Ed.)  2019; Rex v.

Petitioners moved to dismiss the bill upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain it because by Public Resolution No. 53 of June 27, 1934, 48 Stat. 1267, the return of the money and property sought has been postponed. The court sustained the motion and dismissed the bill. The Court of Appeals reversed. 65 App.D.C. 297, 83 F. ( 2d) 554. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 527\n.\n  In substance the bill alleges: Respondent, a German corporation, was created in 1929 by consolidation of Deutsche Bank and Direction der Disconto-Gesellschaft. After the merger, the assets of the latter became respondent's property. The Custodian determined the Disconto-Gesellschaft to be an alien enemy and seized its money and property in this country, which was held by the Custodian and deposited in the Treasury. Respondent, acting under the Settlement of War Claims Act (45 Stat. 254) and in accordance with the Custodian's rules and regulations, filed notice of claim to the property and applied to the President for its return. Before commencement of this suit, the Custodian found it entitled to the property. In March, 1931, Sprunt and others brought an action in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against respondent; a warrant of attachment issued and, pursuant to it, the marshal levied on the money and property so held; because of the attachment petitioners refused to deliver it to respondent and retained custody. In May, 1934, that action was discontinued by plaintiffs and the attachment was released. July 1, 1934, the office of Custodian ceased; his powers and duties were transferred to the Department of Justice; all money and property held by or in trust for him was transferred to the Attorney General. Before commencement of this suit, respondent demanded and petitioners refused delivery of that here in question. Their refusal was based on Public Resolution No. 53. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 118]\n\u00a0\n  The questions for decision are whether that resolution withdrew from the trial court jurisdiction to entertain the bill, and whether it deprives respondent of its property without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment.\n  1. This is in substance a suit against the United States. Banco Mexicano v. Deutsche Bank, \n263 \nU.S. 591, 603\n, 212; Becker Steel Co. v. Cummings, \n296 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 17. By the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917,  9(a)(b)(c),2 as amended by the Settlement of War Claims Act,  11, 20,3 the United States consented, in respect of claims such as the one here in question, to be sued in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Petitioners maintain Resolution No. 53 withdrew that consent.\n  The recitals of that resolution disclose reasons for its adoption. They are: A Joint Resolution of July 2, 1921,4 declared that property of German nationals held under the Trading with the Enemy Act should be retained and no disposition thereof made, except as specifically provided by law, until the German government should make suitable provision for the satisfaction of claims of American nationals against it. The Treaty of Berlin, August 25, 1921,5 accorded to the United States all rights and advantages specified in the resolution of July 2, 1921, including, those stipulated for its benefit in the Treaty of Versailles,6 not ratified by the United States. The Agreement of August 10, 1922,7 established a Mixed Claims \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 119]\n\u00a0\n Commission to adjudicate claims of American nationals against Germany. And, in the debt-funding agreement of June 23, 1930,8 Germany agreed to pay the United States on account of its awards 40,800,000 reichmarks in each year until 1981. Germany was in arrears under that agreement and had failed to make provision for satisfaction of claims established against it.\n  Therefore, the Resolution (48 Stat. 1267) declared: So long as Germany is in arrears in respect of obligations mentioned, all deliveries of property authorized to be made under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended, or the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 as amended, 'whether or not a judgment or decree has been entered with respect thereto, shall be postponed and the money or property, or the income, issues, profits, and\/or avails thereof reserved: * * * Provided * * * That the President may, in his sole discretion, remove the restriction as to any of the cases * * * in relation to which * * * deliveries have been postponed under this resolution.'\n  The consent of the United States to be sued was revocable at any time. Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 581\n, 844. It has not been expressly recalled and, unless by Resolution No. 53 impliedly withdrawn, the Supreme Court of the District had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. Continuation of the consent was not inconsistent with the purpose of the resolution. The measure was adopted because of Germany's default which, as indicated by the context, was assumed not to be permanent. It was intended only temporarily to postpone final disposition of the seized property, merely to stay deliveries whether directed by administrative order or judgment of a court. Claimants may have deliveries whenever Germany ceases to be in arrears. Fulfillment of her promises will end the restraint imposed \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 120]\n\u00a0\n by the resolution. Postponement of deliveries does not suggest intention to withdraw consent to be sued. It was given and long continued in order to safeguard former owners against erroneous administration of measures enacted for their benefit. Neither need nor reason has been suggested for change of policy in that regard. In the absence of unmistakable expression of purpose to that end, it may not reasonably be inferred that Congress intended to withdraw that protection. Cf. Becker Steel Co. v. Cummings, supra, \n296 \nU.S. 74, 80\n, 18. We find nothing to warrant that inference. District of Columbia v. Eslin, \n183 \nU.S. 62, 22\n S. Ct. 17, gives no support to petitioners' contention. Clearly the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.\n  2. Public Resolution No. 53 is not repugnant to the Fifth Amendment. By exertion of the war power, and untrammeled by the due process or just compensation clause, Congress enacted laws directing seizure, use, and disposition of property in this country belonging to subjects of the enemy. Alien enemy owners were divested of every right in respect of the money and property seized and held by the Custodian under the Trading with the Enemy Act. United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 9\n-11, 4. Woodson v. Deutsche, etc., Vormals, \n292 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 805. The title acquired by the United States was absolute and unaffected by definition of duties or limitations upon the power of the Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States. Congress reserved to itself freedom at any time to dispose of the property as deemed expedient and right under circumstances that might arise during and after the war. Legislative history and terms of measures passed in relation to alien enemy property clearly disclose that from the beginning Congress intended after the war justly to deal with former owners and, by restitution or compensation in whole or part, to ameliorate hardships falling upon them as a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 121]\n\u00a0\n result of the seizure of their property. \n9\n But that intention detracted nothing from title acquired by the United States or its power to retain or dispose of the property upon such terms and conditions as from time to time Congress might direct. As the taking left in enemy owners no beneficial right to, or interest in, the property, the United States did not take or hold as trustee for their benefit.\n  Respondent maintains that section 11 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 (50 \nU.S.C.A. Appendix  9(b) amending section 9(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 as amended, vested in former owners an immediate right to the return of their property and that, having complied with the provisions of the act, they cannot be deprived of that right. It argues that its interest in the property taken was not 'completely and irrevocably destroyed' and that the Settlement of War Claims Act was an act under which it 'could and did obtain a vested interest in its property.' To the extent that the argument rests upon the assumption that the taking did not divest enemy owners of every right or that the United States did not acquire absolute title, it is fallacious and need not be noticed.\n  The Settlement of War Claims Act was not a conveyance and did not grant former owners any right or title to, or interest in, the money or property taken by the Custodian. As amended by it, pertinent provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act are indicated in the margin. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 122]\n\u00a0\n No change of title was effected by that Act; and in proceedings under it none takes place before delivery to claimant. As the United States owned all, claimant's consent to postponement of delivery of part did not improve its position as to the rest. The President did not order delivery. Action by him was neither a condition precedent nor a bar to suit. The statute, section 9(a), required the money and property to be retained by the Custodian or Treasurer until final judgment for claimant should be satisfied by delivery, or until final judgment against claimant. It is clear that when the resolution was adopted respondent had neither title nor vested right to have delivery.\n  The grant to former alien enemy owners of the privilege of becoming entitled upon conditions specified to have \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 123]\n\u00a0\n returned to them the property of which they had been deprived by exertion of the war power of the United States was made by the Congress in mitigation of the taking and in recognition of 'the humane and wise policy of modern times.' Brown v. United States, 8 Cranch, 110, 123. In United States v. S. S. WHite Dental Mfg. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 398\n, it appeared that during the war the German government sequestered the property of a German corporation which, through ownership of all its capital stock, was controlled by an American corporation. Speaking of the taking we said (at pages 402, 403 of 274 \nU.S., 600): 'What would ultimately come back to it (the American owner), as the event proved, might be secured, not as a matter of right, but as a matter either of grace to the vanquished or exaction by the victor. * * * It would require a high degree of optimism to discern in the seizure of enemy property by the German government in 1918 more than a remote hope of ultimate salvage from the wreck of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 115\n, 124]\n\u00a0\n war.' We think it clear that the grant by the Settlement of War Claims Act was made as a matter of grace and so was subject to withdrawal by Congress. United States v. Teller, \n107 \nU.S. 64, 68\n; Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160, 166\n; Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571\n, supra, 577, 842.

STATE OF OREGON(1937)\nNo. 123\nArgued: December 9, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon. \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 354]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Maurice E. Tarshis, Dep. Dist. Atty., of Portland, Or., for the State of Oregon.\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 353, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, Dirk De Jonge, was indicted in Multnomah County, Or., for violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Law of that State. \n1\n The act, which we set forth in \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n the margin, defines 'criminal syndicalism' as 'the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, sabotage, or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution.' With this preliminary definition the act proceeds to describe a number of offenses, embracing the teaching of criminal syndicalism, the printing or distribution of books, pamphlets, etc., advocating that doctrine, the organization of a society or assemblage which advocates it, and presiding at or assisting in conducting a meeting of such an organization, society or group. The prohibited acts are made felonies, punishable by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both.\n We are concerned with but one of the described offenses and with the validity of the statute in this particular application. The charge is that appellant assisted in the conduct of a meeting which was called under the auspices of the Communist Party, an organization advocating criminal syndicalism. The defense was that the meeting was public and orderly and was held for a lawful purpose; that, while it was held under the auspices of the Communist Party, neither criminal syndicalism nor any unlawful conduct was taught or advocated at the meeting either by appellant or by others. Appellant moved for a direction of acquittal, contending that the statute as applied to him, for merely assisting at a meeting called by the Communist Party at which nothing unlawful was done or advocated, violated the due process clause of the \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 358]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n This contention was overruled. Appellant was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State which considered the constitutional question and sustained the statute as thus applied. 152 Or. 315, 51 P.(2d) 674. The case comes here on appeal.\n The record does not present the evidence adduced at the trial. The parties have substituted a stipulation of facts, which was made and filed after the decision of the Supreme Court of the State and after the Chief Justice of that court had allowed the appeal and had directed transmission here of a certified transcript of the record. We do not approve of that practice, where it does not appear that the stipulation has received the approval of the court, as we think that adherence to our rule as to the preparation of records is important for the protection of the court whose decision is under review as well as of this court. See rule 10 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 354). But, as the question presented in this instance does not turn upon an appreciation of the facts on any disputed point, we turn to the merits.\n The stipulation, after setting forth the charging part of the indictment, recites in substance the following: That on July 27, 1934, there was held in Portland a meeting which had been advertised by handbills issued by the Portland section of the Communist Party; that the number of persons in attendance was variously estimated at from 150 to 300; that some of those present, who were members of the Communist Party, estimated that not to exceed 10 to 15 per cent. of those in attendance were such members; that the meeting was open to the public without charge and no questions were asked of those entering, with respect to their relation to the Communist Party; that the notice of the meeting advertised it as a \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 359]\n\u00a0\n protest against illegal raids on workers' halls and homes and against the shooting of striking longshoremen by Portland police; that the chairman stated that it was a meeting held by the Communist Party; that the first speaker dwelt on the activities of the Young Communist League; that the defendant De Jonge, the second speaker, was a member of the Communist Party and went to the meeting to speak in its name; that in his talk he protested against conditions in the county jail, the action of city police in relation to the maritime strike then in progress in Portland, and numerous other matters; that he discussed the reason for the raids on the Communist headquarters and workers' halls and offices; that he told the workers that these attacks were due to efforts on the part of the steamship companies and stevedoring companies to break the maritime longshoremen's and seamen's strike; that they hoped to break the strike by pitting the longshoremen and seamen against the Communist movement; that there was also testimony to the effect that defendant asked those present to do more work in obtaining members for the Communist Party and requested all to be at the meeting of the party to be held in Portland on the following evening and to bring their friends to show their defiance to local police authority and to assist them in their revolutionary tactics; that there was also testimony that defendant urged the purchase of certain communist literature which was sold at the meeting; that while the meeting was still in progress it was raided by the police; that the meeting was conducted in an orderly manner; that defendant and several others who were actively conducting the meeting were arrested by the police; and that on searching the hall the police found a quantity of communist literature.\n The stipulation then set forth various extracts from the literature of the Communist Party to show its advocacy of criminal syndicalism. The stipulation does not disclose \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 360]\n\u00a0\n any activity by the defendant as a basis for his prosecution other than his participation in the meeting in question. Nor does the stipulation show that the communist literature distributed at the meeting contained any advocacy of criminal syndicalism or of any unlawful conduct. It was admitted by the Attorney General of the State in his argument at the bar of this Court that the literature distributed in the meeting was not of that sort and that the extracts contained in the stipulation were taken from communist literature found elsewhere. Its introduction in evidence was for the purpose of showing that the Communist Party as such did advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism, a fact which is not disputed on this appeal.\n While the stipulation of facts is but a condensed statement, still much of it is irrelevant in the light of the particular charge of the indictment as construed by the Supreme Court. The indictment charged as follows:\n'The said Dirk De Jonge, Don Cluster, Edward R. Denny and Earl Stewart on the 27th day of July, A.D., 1934, in the county of Multnomah and state of Oregon, then and there being, did then and there unlawfully and feloniously preside at, conduct and assist in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society and group, to wit: The Communist Party, a more particular description of which said assemblage of persons, organization, society and group is to this grand jury unknown, which said assemblage of persons, organization, society and group did then and there unlawfully and feloniously teach and advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage, contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Oregon.'\n\n On the theory that this was a charge that criminal syndicalism and sabotage were advocated at the meeting in question, defendant moved for acquittal, insisting that the evidence was insufficient to warrant his conviction. \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 361]\n\u00a0\n The trial court denied his motion, and error in this respect was assigned on appeal. The Supreme Court of the State put aside that contention by ruling that the indictment did not charge that criminal syndicalism or sabotage was advocated at the meeting described in the evidence, either by defendant or by any one else. The words of the indictment that 'said assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group did then and there unlawfully and feloniously teach and advocate the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage,' referred not to the meeting in question, or to anything then and there said or done by defendant or others, but to the advocacy of criminal syndicalism and sabotage by the Communist Party in Multnomah County. The ruling of the state court upon this point was precise. The court said, 152 Or. 315, at page 330, 51 P.(2d) 674, 680:\n'Turning now to the grounds for a directed verdict set forth in defendant's motion therefor, we note that he asserts and argues that the indictment charges the assemblage at which he spoke with unlawfully and feloniously teaching and advocating the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage, and elsewhere in the same motion he contends that the indictment charges the defendant with unlawfully and feloniously teaching and advocating said doctrine at said meeting. The indictment does not, however, charge the defendant, nor the assemblage, at which he spoke, with teaching or advocating at said meeting at 68 Southwest Alder street, in the city of Portland, the doctrine of criminal syndicalism or sabotage. What the indictment does charge, in plain and concise language, is that the defendant presided at, conducted and assisted in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group, to-wit, the Communist Party which said assemblage of persons, organization, society, and group was unlawfully teaching and advocating in Multnomah county the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage.'\n\n In this view, lack of sufficient evidence as to illegal advocacy or action at the meeting became immaterial. \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 362]\n\u00a0\n Having limited the charge to defendant's participation in a meeting called by the Communist Party, the state court sustained the conviction upon that basis regardless of what was said or done at the meeting.\n We must take the indictment as thus construed. Conviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process. It thus appears that, while defendant was a member of the Communist Party, he was not indicted for participating in its organization, or for joining it, or for soliciting members or for distributing its literature. He was not charged with teaching or advocating criminal syndicalism or sabotage or any unlawful acts, either at the meeting or elsewhere. He was accordingly deprived of the benefit of evidence as to the orderly and lawful conduct of the meeting and that it was not called or used for the advocacy of criminal syndicalism or sabotage or any unlawful action. His sole offense as charged, and for which he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, was that he had assisted in the conduct of a public meeting, albeit otherwise lawful, which was held under the auspices of the Communist Party.\n The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist Party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any speaker, although not a member who 'assisted in the conduct' of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist Party. This manifest result was brought out sharply at this bar by the concessions which the Attoney General made, and could not avoid, in the light of the decision of the state court. \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 363]\n\u00a0\n Thus, if the Communist Party had called a public meeting in Portland to discuss the tariff, or the foreign policy of the government, or taxation, or relief, or candidacies for the offices of President, members of Congress, Governor, or state legislators, every speaker who assisted in the conduct of the meeting would be equally guilty with the defendant in this case, upon the charge as here defined and sustained. The list of illustrations might be indefinitely extended to every variety of meetings under the auspices of the Communist Party although held for the discussion of political issues or to adopt protests and pass resolutions of an entirely innocent and proper character.\n While the States are entitled to protect themselves from the abuse of the privileges of our institutions through an attempted substitution of force and violence in the place of peaceful political action in order to effect revolutionary changes in government, none of our decisions go to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application. In Gitlow v. People of State of New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, 45 S.Ct. 625, under the New York statute defining criminal anarchy, the defendant was found to be responsible for a 'manifesto' advocating the overthrow of the government by violence and unlawful means. Id., \n268 U.S. 652\n, at pages 656, 662, 663, 45 S.Ct. 625, 628. In Whitney v. People of State of California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, 47 S.Ct. 641, under the California statute relating to criminal syndicalism, the defendant was found guilty of willfully and deliberately assisting in the forming of an organization for the purpose of carrying on a revolutionary class struggle by criminal methods. The defendant was convicted of participation in what amounted to a conspiracy to commit serious crimes. Id., \n274 U.S. 357\n, at pages 363, 364, 367, 379, 47 S.Ct. 641, 644, 645, 649. The case of Burns v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 650, involved a similar ruling under the California statute as \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 364]\n\u00a0\n extended to the Yosemite National Park. Id., \n274 U.S. 328\n, at pages 330, 331, 47 S.Ct. 650, 651. On the other hand, in Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380\n, 47 S.Ct. 655, the criminal syndicalism act of that State was held to have been applied unconstitutionally and the judgment of conviction was reversed, where it was not shown that unlawful methods had been advocated. Id., \n274 U.S. 380\n, at page 387, 47 S.Ct. 655, 657. See, also, Stromberg v. People of State of California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484\n\n\n Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Gitlow v. New York, supra, \n268 U.S. 652\n, at page 666, 45 S.Ct. 625, 629; Stromberg v. California, supra, \n283 U.S. 359\n, at page 368, 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 627; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233, 243\n, 244 S., 56 S.Ct. 444, 446. The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental. As this Court said in United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n, 552: 'The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.' The First Amendment of the Federal Constitution expressly guarantees that right against abridgment by Congress. But explicit mention there does not argue exclusion elsewhere. For the right is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions-principles which the Fourteenth Amendment embodies in the general terms of its due process clause. Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 48 A.L.R. 1102; Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 67\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 63, 84 A.L.R. 527; Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra.\n These rights may be abused by using speech or press or assembly in order to incite to violence and crime. The people through their Legislatures may protect themselves against that abuse. But the legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 365]\n\u00a0\n abuse. The rights themselves must not be curtailed. The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means. Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\n It follows from these considerations that, consistently with the Federal Constitution, peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime. The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot be proscribed. Those who assist in the conduct of such meetings cannot be branded as criminals on that score. The question, if the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are to be preserved, is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects. If the persons assembling have committed crimes elsewhere, if they have formed or are engaged in a conspiracy against the public peace and order, they may be prosecuted for their conspiracy or other violation of valid laws. But it is a different matter when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such offenses, seizes upon mere participation in a peaceable assembly and a lawful public discussion as the basis for a criminal charge.\n We are not called upon to review the findings of the state court as to the objectives of the Communist Party. Notwithstanding those objectives, the defendant still enjoyed his personal right of free speech and to take part in a peaceable assembly having a lawful purpose, although \n\n[299 U.S. 353, 366]\n\u00a0\n called by that party. The defendant was none the less entitled to discuss the public issues of the day and thus in a lawful manner, without incitement to violence or crime, to seek redress of alleged grievances. That was of the essence of his guaranteed personal liberty.\n We hold that the Oregon statute as applied to the particular charge as defined by the state court is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Oregon Code 1930,  14-3,110 to 14-3,112, as amended by chapter 459, p. 868,  1-3, Oregon Laws 1933:\n'Sec. 14-3.110.

Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 623]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Respondent was convicted in the District of Columbia police court of engaging, without a license, in the business of a dealer in secondhand personal property, to wit, the unused portions of railway excursion tickets, in violation of section 7, par. 39, of the Act of Congress, approved July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 622, 627, c. 1352, as amended by the Act of July 1, 1932, 47 Stat. 550, 558, c. 366. On arraignment she demanded a jury trial, which was denied, and on conviction she was sentenced to pay a fine of $300 or to be confined in jail for sixty days. The case was brought to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by writ of error to review the denial of the respondent's request for a jury, and other rulings of the trial court which, it was claimed, had deprived her of a fair trial. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that a jury trial was guaranteed to petitioner by the Constitution, but that the trial had been fair in other respects. 66 App.D.C. 11, 84 F.(2d) 265. We granted certiorari, \n299 \nU.S. 524\n.\n  The statute under which petitioner was convicted provides that the offense may be prosecuted in the District of Columbia police court and is punishable by a fine of not more than $300 or imprisonment for not more than ninety days. The Code of the District of Columbia \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 624]\n\u00a0\n (1929) Tit. 18,  165, provides that prosecutions in the police court shall be on information and that the trial shall be by jury in all cases 'in which, according to the Constitution of the United States, the accused would be entitled to a jury trial,' and that, 'in all cases where the accused would not by force of the Constitution of the United States be entitled to a trial by jury, the trial shall be by the court without a jury, unless in * * * cases wherein the fine or penalty may be more than $ 300, or imprisonment as punishment for the offense may be more than ninety days, the accused shall demand a trial by jury, in which case the trial shall be by jury.' Article 3, section 2, clause 3, of the Constitution, provides that 'the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury.' The Sixth Amendment declares that 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.'\n  It is settled by the decisions of this Court, which need not now be discussed in detail, that the right of trial by jury, thus secured, does not extend to every criminal proceeding. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution there were numerous offenses, commonly described as 'petty,' which were tried summarily without a jury, by justices of the peace in England, and by police magistrates or corresponding judicial officers in the Colonies, and punished by commitment to jail, a workhouse, or a house of correction. \n1\n We think, as the Court of Appeals held and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 625]\n\u00a0\n respondent concedes, that, apart from the prescribed penalty, the offense of which petitioner was convicted is, by its nature, of this class, and that were it not for the severity of the punishment, the offender could not, under our decisions, claim a trial by jury as of right. Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 1\n Ann.Cas. 585; and see Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 552\n, 555; Natal v. Louisiana, \n139 \nU.S. 621, 624\n; District of Columbia v. Colts, \n282 \nU.S. 63, 72\n, 73, 53.\n  Engaging in the business of selling secondhand property without a license was not indictable at common law. Today it is at most but an infringement of local police regulations, and its moral quality is relatively inoffensive. But this Court has refused to foreclose consideration of the severity of the penalty as an element to be considered in determining whether a statutory offense, in other respects trivial and not a crime at common law, must be deemed so serious as to be comparable with common-law crimes, and thus to entitle the accused to the benefit of a jury trial prescribed by the Constitution. See Schick v. United States, supra, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 67\n, 68, 1 Ann.Cas. 585.\n  We are thus brought to the question whether the penalty, which may be imposed for the present offense, of ninety days in a common jail, is sufficient to bring it within the class of major offenses, for the trial of which a jury may be demanded. The court below thought, as we do, that the question is not free from doubt, but concluded, in view of the fact that the statute allows no appeal as of right from the conviction for the offense, and in view of its own estimate of the severity of the penalty, that three months' imprisonment is a punishment sufficiently rigorous to place respondent's delinquency in the category of major offenses.\n  If we look to the standard which prevalid at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, we find that confinement for a period of ninety days or more was not an un \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 626]\n\u00a0\n usual punishment for petty offenses, tried without a jury. Laying aside those for which the punishment was of a type no longer commonly employed, such as whipping, confinement in stocks, and the like, and others, punished by commitment for an indefinite period, we know that there were petty offenses, triable summarily under English statutes, which carried possible sentences of imprisonment for periods from three to twelve months. 2 At least sixteen statutes, passed prior to the time of the American Revolution by the Colonies, or shortly after by the newlycreated states, authorized the summary punishment of petty offenses by imprisonment for three months or more. \n3\n And at least eight others were punishable by imprisonment for six months. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n  In the face of this history, we find it impossible to say that a ninety-day penalty for a petty offense, meted out \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 627]\n\u00a0\n upon a trial without a jury, does not conform to standards which prevailed when the Constitution was adopted, or was not then contemplated as appropriate notwithstanding the constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. This conclusion is unaffected by the fact that respondent is not entitled to an appeal as of right. Code of the District of Columbia (1929) Tit. 18 ,  28. The safeguards of an appeal are different in nature and purpose from those of a jury trial. At common law there was no review of criminal cases as of right. Due process does not comprehend the right of appeal. McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684, 687\n. The early statutes providing for summary trial often did not allow it. And in any case it cannot be assumed that the authority to allow an appeal, given to the justices of the Court of Appeals by the District laws, will not be exercised in a proper case.\n  We are aware that those standards of action and of policy which find expression in the common and statute law may vary from generation to generation. Such change has led to the abandonment of the lash and the stocks, and we may assume, for present purposes, that commonly accepted views of the severity of punishment by imprisonment may become so modified that a penalty once thought to be mild may come to be regarded as so harsh as to call for the jury trial, which the Constitution prescribes, in some cases which were triable without a jury when the Constitution was adopted. See Schick v. United States, supra, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 67\n, 68, 1 Ann.Cas. 585; compare Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 373\n, 19 Ann.Cas. 705; District of Columbia v. Colts, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 63, 74\n, 53; Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 71\n-73, 65, 84 A.L.R. 527; United States v. Wood, \n299 \nU.S. 123, 141\n et seq., 183. But we may doubt whether summary trial with punishment of more than six months' imprisonment, prescribed by some pre-Revolutionary statutes,5 is admissible, without concluding \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 628]\n\u00a0\n that a penalty of ninety days is too much. Doubts must be resolved, not subjectively by recourse of the judge to his own sympathy and emotions, but by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments.\n  Congress itself, by measuring the punishment in this case in conformity to the commonly accepted standard when the Constitution was adopted, and declaring that it should be applied today unless found to transgress constitutional limitations, has expressed its deliberate judgment that the punishment is not too great to be summarily administered. A number of states have continued in force statutes providing for trial, without a jury, of violations of municipal ordinances, and sundry petty statutory offenses, punishable by commitment for three months or more. \n6\n Convictions under such legislation have been up \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 629]\n\u00a0\n held many times in the state courts, despite objections to the denial of a jury trial. \n7\n In England many acts of Parliament now in force, authorizing ninety day punishments, call for summary trials. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n  This record of statute and judicial decision is persuasive that there has been no such change in the generally accepted standards of punishment as would overcome the presumption that a summary punishment of ninety days' imprisonment, permissible when the Constitution was adopted, is permissible now. Respondent points to no \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 630]\n\u00a0\n contrary evidence. We cannot say that this penalty, when attached to the offense of selling secondhand goods without a license, gives it the character of a common-law crime or of a major offense, or that it so offends the public sense of propriety and fairness as to bring it within the sweep of a constitutional protection which it did not previously enjoy.\n  Although we conclude that respondent's demand for a jury trial was rightly denied, there must be a new trial because of the prejudicial restriction, by the trial judge, of cross-examination by respondent. The testimony of five prosecution witnesses was the sole evidence of the acts of respondent relied on to establish the doing of business without a license. These acts were the sale by her, on each of three occasions, to one or another of the witnesses, of the unused portion of a round trip railway passenger ticket from New York to Washington. Three of the five, a man and his wife and another, were employed by the Railroad Inspection Company as investigators. The other two were company police of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. All were private police or detectives, apparently acting in the course of their private employment. Common experience teaches us that the testimony of such witnesses, especially when uncorroborated, is open to the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 631]\n\u00a0\n suspicion of bias, see Gassenheimer v. United States, 26 App.D.C. 432, 446; Moller v. Moller, 115 N.Y. 466, 468, 22 N.E. 169; People v. Loris, 131 App. Div. 127, 130, 115 N.Y.S. 236; Sopwith v. Sopwith, 4 Swab. & T. 243, 246, 247; Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.1923)  949, 969, 2062, and that their cross-examination should not be curtailed summarily, see State v. Diedtman, 58 Mont. 13, 24, 190 P. 117, especially when it has a direct bearing on the substantial issues of the case.\n  The defense was a suggested mistaken identity of respondent and an alibi, that at the times mentioned she was confined to her bed by illness, at her home in Newark, N.J. A number of questions on cross-examination by respondent were aimed at showing mistaken identity and at testing credibility. She asked one witness whether respondent had been pointed out to him. She asked another whether he had any trouble in 'knowing' the respondent at the trial, and whether he had seen her before the date of the alleged sale of tickets to which he testified. All these questions were excluded, as were others which were proper, since they might have established contradiction in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.\n  Other questions, which were relevant to the issue and obviously proper tests of credibility, were excluded. The woman witness had testified that one of the sales took place in the presence of her husband, and of the two railroad police witnesses. On cross-examination she could not remember whether any one beside her husband was present. Yet respondent was not permitted to ask the husband whether the railroad police witnesses were \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 632]\n\u00a0\n known to him or to ask one of the latter whether he knew the husband and wife before the date of the alleged sale. The court instructed one of the police officers not to answer the question whether the husband had come to Washington by prearrangement. Like questions addressed to the husband and his wife were excluded. The respondent was similarly prevented from making inquiries as to corroborative detail, such as the time of day when the witnesses arrived in Washington on the dates of the alleged sales, and the place of residence of a witness, see Alford v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 687\n. In the circumstances of the case, these questions may have had an important bearing on the accuracy and truthfulness of the testimony of the prosecuting witnesses. We do not stop to give other examples of the summary curtailment of all inquiry as to matters which are the appropriate subject of cross-examination.\n  The extent of cross-examination rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. Reasonable restriction of undue cross-examination, and the more rigorous exclusion of questions irrelevant to the substantial issues of the case, and of slight bearing on the bias and credibility of the witnesses, are not reversible errors. But the prevention, throughout the trial of a criminal case, of all inquiry in fields where cross-examination is appropriate, and particularly in circumstances where the excluded questions have a bearing on credibility and on the commission by the accused of the acts relied upon for conviction, passes the proper limits of discretion and is prejudicial error. See Alford v. United States, supra.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals will be affirmed, that of the police court reversed, and the case will be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 633]\n\u00a0\n remanded with instructions for a new trial without a jury.\n  Affirmed.\n  Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n  Mr. Justice BUTLER and I approve the conclusion of the Court of Appeals concerning respondent's right to trial by jury; also we accept the supporting opinion announced there as entirely adequate.\n  The Sixth Amendment-In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy, and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\n  The Seventh Amendment-In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of the common law.\n  We cannot agree that when a citizen is put on trial for an offense punishable by 90 days in jail or a fine of $300, the prosecution is not criminal within the Sixth Amendment. In a suit at common law to recover above $20, a jury trial is assured. And to us, it seems improbable that while providing for this protection in such a trifling matter the framers of the Constitution intended \n\n[300 \nU.S. 617\n, 634]\n\u00a0\n that it might be denied where imprisonment for a considerable time or liability for fifteen times $20 confronts the accused.\n  In view of the opinion just announced, it seems permissible to inquire what will become of the other solemn declarations of the Amendment. Constitutional guarantees ought not to be subordinated to convenience, nor denied upon questionable precedents or uncertain reasoning. See Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n; In re Debs et al., \n158 \nU.S. 564, 594\n.\n  We concur in the conclusion of the Court concerning unfairness of the trial and the necessity for a new one.\n  This cause shows the grave danger to liberty when one accused must submit to the uncertain judgment of a single magistrate. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, 280, 281; McNamara's Paley on Summary Convictions (4th Ed.1856) 1012; Dillon, Municipal Corporations,  433 ( 5th Ed.1911,  750).

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF CITY OF CHICAGO(1937)\n\nArgued: October 14, 1937Decided: November 8, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 75]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Allan J. Carter, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Messrs. Frank S. Righeimer and Richard S. Folsom, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants challenge an act of Illinois which they assert impairs the obligation of contracts in contravention of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, and deprives them of a vested right without due process contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute decreased the amounts of annuity payments to retired teachers in the public schools of Chicago.1\n Since 1895, the state has had legislation creating a teachers' pension and retirement fund, originally the fruit of teachers' contributions and gifts or legacies, but later augmented by allotments from interest received and from taxes. With this fund and the benefit payments thereunder we are not concerned.\n Prior to 1917, teachers in the Chicago schools were employed for such terms as the Board of Education might fix. \n2\n In that year an act was passed providing for a probationary period of three years and prohibiting removal thereafter except for cause. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n In 1926 an act, known as the Miller Law,4 became effective. This provided for compulsory retirement and for the payment of annuities to retired teachers. By section 1 the Board of Education was directed to retire teachers from active service on February 1 and August 1 of each year according to the following program: In 1926, those 75 years of age or over; in 1927, those 74 years of age or over; in 1928, those 73 years of age or over; in 1929, those 72 years of age or over; and in 1930, and in each year thereafter, those 70 years of age or over. Section 2 (Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 122,  614b) provided: 'Each person so retired from active service who served in the public schools of such city for twenty or more years prior to such retirement, shall be paid the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) annually and for life from the date of such retirement from the money derived from the general tax levy for educational purposes.'\n There were two provisos; the one requiring that the annuitant should be subject to call by the superintendent of schools for consultation and advisory service, and the other declaring that the annuity granted by the act was not to be in lieu of, but in addition to, the retirement allowance payable under existing legislation.\n In 1927, a third section was added5 permitting teachers who had served for 25 years or more, and were 65 years of age or over, who had not reached the age of compulsory retirement, to be retired upon request and to be paid from $1,000 to $1,500 per annum, depending upon age at retirement. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n The appellants fall into three classes: Those who were compulsorily retired under the Miller Law; those who voluntarily retired under the law as amended; and those eligible for voluntary retirement who had signified their election to retire prior to July, 1935\n\n\n July 12, 1935, a further amendment of the Miller Law was adopted6 requiring the board presently to retire teachers then in service who were 65 years of age or over, and in the future to retire teachers as they attained that age. Each person so retired was to be paid $500 annually for life from the date of retirement. The provisions that such teachers should hold themselves available for advisory service and consultation and that the annuity payments should be in addition to those made to retired teachers pursuant to other legislation were retained. Section 3 of the Miller Law, permitting voluntary retirement between the ages of 65 and 70, was repealed. As construed by the state Supreme Court, the new law reduced to $500 the annuities of teachers theretofore retired, or eligible for retirement under the Miller Law, as well as those to be retired subsequent to its enactment.\n Some of the appellants filed a class bill, in which the others intervened as coplaintiffs, alleging that their rights to annuities were vested rights of which they could not be deprived; that the Miller Law constituted an offer which each of them had accepted by remaining in service until compulsory retirement or by retiring; that the obligation of the contract had thus been perfected and its attempted impairment by the later enactment was ineffective; and praying that the board be commanded to rescind action taken pursuant to the Act of 1935, and enjoined from complying with its provisions. The appellee \n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n Board of Education filed an answer in which it denied the existence of a contract and asserted that the payments to be made to appellants were pensions, subject to revocation or alteration at the will of the Legislature. The appellee city of Chicago filed a motion to dismiss for want of equity. After a hearing, at which testimony was taken on behalf of the appellants, the trial court dismissed the bill.\n The Supreme Court of the state affirmed, holding that, notwithstanding the payments under the Miller Law are denominated annuities, they cannot be differentiated from similar payments directed by law to be made to other retired civil servants of the state and her municipalities, and are in fact pensions or gratuities involving no agreement of the parties and subject to modification or abolition at the pleasure of the Legislature. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The parties agree that a state may enter into contracts with citizens, the obligation of which the Legislature cannot impair by subsequent enactment. They agree that legislation which merely declares a state policy, and directs a subordinate body to carry it into effect, is subject to revision or repeal in the discretion of the Legislature. The point of controversy is as to the category into which the Miller Law falls.\n In determining whether a law tenders a contract to a citizen, it is of first importance to examine the language of the statute. If it provides for the execution of a written contract on behalf of the state, the case for an obligation binding upon the state is clear. \n8\n Equally clear is the case where a statute confirms a settlement of disputed rights and defines its terms. 9 On the other hand, an act merely fixing salaries of officers creates no contract in their favor, and the compensation named may \n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n be altered at the will of the Legislature. \n10\n This is true also of an act fixing the term or tenure of a public officer or an employe of a state agency. \n11\n The presumption is that such a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights, but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the Legislature shall ordain otherwise. He who asserts the creation of a contract with the state in such a case has the burden of overcoming the presumption. \n12\n If, upon a construction of the statute, it is found that the payments are gratuities, involving no agreement of the parties, the grant of them creates no vested right. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The Supreme Court of Illinois concluded that neither the language of the Miller Law, nor the circumstances of its adoption, evinced an intent on the part of the Legislature to create a binding contract with the teachers of the state. While we are required to reach an independent judgment as to the existence and nature of the alleged contract, we give great weight to the views of the highest court of the state touching these matters. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The Miller Law is entitled, 'An Act to provide for the compulsory and voluntary retirement of teachers, ... and for the payment of retirement annuities.' Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 122,  614a, note. The relevant words of section 1 are: 'In every city in this State ... the board of education of such city shall retire from active \n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n service ... all teachers, (of a given age).' Section 2 provides: 'Each person so retired ... shall be paid the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ($ 1,500.00) annually and for life from the date of such retirement.' Section 3 provides that persons 65 years of age or over 'shall upon their own request be retired ... and thereafter be paid annuities for life.' Appellants admit that this is not the normal langauge of a contract, but rely on the circumstance that they, as teachers, especially those who voluntarily retired when otherwise they would not have been required so to do, rightly understood the state was pledging its faith that it would not recede from the offer held out to them by the statute as an inducement to become teachers and to retire, and that the use of the term 'annuities' rather than 'pensions' was intended as a further assurance of a vested contractual right. The Supreme Court answered this contention by referring to the fact that for years prior to the adoption of the Miller Law, and by a uniform course of decision, it had held that acts indistinguishable from the Miller Law, establishing similar benefit systems, did not create contracts or vested rights, and that the state was free to alter, amend, and repeal such laws, even though the effect of its action was to deprive the pensioner or annuitant, for the future, of benefits then enjoyed. The cases to which the court refers so decide. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n The court further held that the Legislature presumably had the doctrine of these cases in mind when it adopted the act now under review, and that the appellants should have known that no distinction was intended between the rights conferred on them and those adjudicated under like laws with respect to other retired civil servants. We cannot say that this was error.\n The appellants urge that the Miller Law, contrary to most of the acts that preceded it, omitted to use the word 'pension' and instead used the word 'annuity,' a choice of terminology based on contract rather than on gift, and implying a consideration received as well as offered. The state Supreme Court (364 Ill. 547, 5 N.E.(2d) 84, 88) answered the contention by saying: 'We are unable to see the distinction. The plan of payment is the same, the purposes are evidently the same, and the use of the term 'annuity' instead of 'pension'-which is but an annuity-does not seem to us to result in the distinction for which counsel for appellants contend.'\n We are of the same opinion, particularly as an examination of the Illinois statutes indicates that, in acts dealing with the subject, the Legislature has apparently used the terms 'pensions,' 'benefits,' and 'annuities' interchangeably as having the same connotation. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act embraces teachers, principals, district superintendents, and assistant superintendents, and retired members of those classes are among the appellants.

AMERICAN SURETY CO. OF NEW YORK(1937)\nNo. 340\nArgued: Decided: March 29, 1937\n\n\n[ Dugas v. American Surety Co. of New York   \n300 \nU.S. 414\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents a controversy over the scope and effect of the decrees of a federal District Court in a suit brought by a surety company under the Interpleader \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 416]\n\u00a0\n Act of May 8, 1926,1 and over the propriety of subsequent proceedings in the same court upon a supplemental bill brought in aid of and to effectuate that decree.\n  It will be helpful to state the facts with some detail.\n  February 12, 1930, the Lumbermen's Reciprocal Association, a Texas insurance corporation, by way of qualifying itself to engage in writing workmen's compensation and other insurance in Louisiana, executed a bond, in the sum of $20,000, conditioned for the payment of claims lawfully arising against it by reason of insurance so written. The bond was given conformably to a Louisiana statute,2 and was executed by the American Surety Company, a New York corporation, as surety. Later in 1930, and after writing a substantial volume of insurance in Louisiana, the Lumbermen's Reciprocal Association became embarrassed and was placed in the hands of a receiver by a court in Texas.\n  April 14, 1931, in a suit brought in a Louisiana court, Etienne Dugas, who had a claim against the Lumbermen's Reciprocal Association arising out of workmen's compensation insurance written by it in Louisiana, recovered against the American Surety Company, as surety on the qualifying bond, a judgment for the payment of $20 per week for not more than 300 weeks commencing May 15, 1930, subject to modification as to future payments if his disability was relieved or reduced, and for $250 for medical bills, together with costs.\n  The American Surety Company appealed to the Court of Appeal from that judgment, and, for the purpose of suspending execution pending the appeal, it executed a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 417]\n\u00a0\n bond conditioned that it should diligently prosecute its appeal and satisfy whatever judgment might be rendered against it if cast in the appeal. The appeal bond was given conformably to a law of the state,3 was in the sum of $10,000, and was executed by the New York Casualty Company as surety. The appeal was perfected and the record duly filed in the Court of Appeal, but nothing further was done therein for reasons which soon will appear.\n  Many other claims arising out of insurance written in Louisiana by the Lumbermen's Reciprocal Association were asserted under the qualifying bond. In the aggregate, these claims were far in excess of the amount of the bond.\n  June 6, 1931, desiring to avail itself of the provisions of the Interpleader Act of May 8, 1926, the American Surety Company, with the court's leave, paid into the registry of the federal District Court at New Orleans, La., the sum of $20,000, being the full amount of the qualifying bond, and thereupon filed in that court a duly verified bill of interpleader in which it set forth the several matters here recited, including the proceedings, judgment, and appeal in Dugas' suit on the qualifying bond; stated the names and places of residence of the several claimants under that bond, so far as they were known to it; and further alleged-\n'This Court has jurisdiction because this is a bill of interpleader in equity brought by a surety company against bona fide adverse claimants against its bond of February 12, 1930, two or more of whom are citizens of different states, and one or more of said adverse claimants resides or reside within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.'\n\n'Plaintiff disclaims any interest in the amount of its said bond except to pay same to the persons lawfully entitled thereto.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 418]\n\u00a0\n  'By reason of the conflicting claims against the said bond, and the fact that claims already known to plaintiff greatly exceed the amount of the said bond, plaintiff is in grave danger of being greatly harassed and damaged, and cannot safely make payments to any claimant without the aid of this Court.'\n\n'Plaintiff, with the permission of this Court first obtained, has paid into the Registry of this Court the said sum of $20,000.00, the amount of said bond, to abide the judgment of this Court.'\n\n  The bill prayed that Dugas and the other claimants be cited to interplead and settle among themselves their claims to the amount of the bond deposited in the court's registry; that each of them be temporarily and permanently enjoined from instituting or prosecuting in any state court or in any other federal court any suit on account of any right or claim growing out of the qualifying bond; that the plaintiff be released from all further liability on the qualifying bond; and that any other or further relief deemed proper in the premises be granted.\n  All claimants under the qualifying bond, including Dugas, were called into the suit as defendants.\n  June 24, 1931, the court after a hearing granted an interlocutory injunction conforming to the prayer in the bill.\n  Dugas risisted the bill by an exception of no cause of action, a plea of estoppel, and an answer. In the plea and answer he specifically relied on the judgment of April 14, 1931, in the state court and the appeal therefrom together with the appeal bond, as showing that he should not be brought into the interpleader suit.\n  September 19, 1932, after a full hearing, the court rendered a decree as follows:\n  1. Declaring the American Surety Company had complied with all of its obligations under the qualifying bond by depositing the full amount of the bond in the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 419]\n\u00a0\n court's registry at the time of bringing the suit; and further declaring that company, by reason of such compliance, to be released and discharged from any and all further liability on account of such bond;\n  2. Enjoining each of the defendants from instituting or prosecuting in any state court, or in any other federal court, any suit against the American Surety Company on account of any right or claim growing out of such bond; and\n  3. Appointing a special master and charging him with the duty of hearing the claimants and reporting upon the manner in which the fund deposited in the registry, less specified fees and costs, should be distributed among the claimants.\n  No appeal was taken then or thereafter from that decree; and it remained in full force and effect.\n  In due course hearings were had and evidence was produced before the special master, after which he submitted a report containing his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for a distribution of the fund, less fees and costs, among the several claimants upon a pro rata basis. The report also contained a statement showing what he found to be the true and full amount of each claim, the total being in excess of $60, 000, and a further statement showing the amount which, on a pro rata distribution would be payable on each claim. As to Dugas' claim, the master reported the true and full amount as $4,160.684 and the pro rata share of the fund payable on the claim as $1,141.29.\n  Shortly after the special master's report was submitted, the several claimants, including Dugas, entered into and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 420]\n\u00a0\n filed in the suit a written stipulation declaring that they acquiesced in the report, waived the time allowed for filing exceptions, and requested the court to confirm the report and make it the court's decree.\n  April 20, 1933, the court, with the special master's report and the stipulation before it, rendered a decree confirming the report and directing that the balance of the fund in the registry be distributed among the several claimants in accordance with the master's recommendations. No appeal was taken from this decree.\n  The fund was distributed and paid out accordingly and was thereby exhausted. Dugas accepted the pro rata share accorded to him in the master's report and the confirming decree.\n  March 7, 1934, Dugas brought a suit in the Louisiana court before mentioned against the New York Casualty Company, the surety on the appeal bond given in his earlier suit on the qualifying bond. In this new suit he asserted that the American Surety Company, defendant in the earlier suit and principal in the appeal bond, had not diligently prosecuted its appeal, but, on the contrary, had brought the interpleader suit in the federal court and had obtained therein an injunction which in effect prohibited him from securing a determination of the appeal; and that it had thereby abandoned the appeal and violated the condition of the appeal bond. While the new suit was based on an asserted breach of the appeal bond by the principal, it was brought against the surety alone. The relief prayed was a judgment in Dugas' favor for $3,019.39, being the difference between the amount of his workmen's compensation claim as ascertained in the interpleader suit and the sum allowed and paid to him in that suit as his pro rata share of the fund arising from the deposit in court of the full amount of the qualifying bond. By an amended petition, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 421]\n\u00a0\n the amount for which judgment was prayed was reduced to $2,999 to forestall a removal to the federal court.\n  To the new suit the New York Casualty Company interposed the exception of prematurity, among others. The court sustained that exception, without ruling on the others, and dismissed the suit. Dugas appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, which, on January 7, 1935, reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded the suit for further proceedings. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n  January 29, 1935, the American Surety Company, with the leave of the federal court, filed in the interpleader suit a supplemental bill in which it set forth the matters and proceedings occurring after the decree of September 19, 1932, in that suit; alleged that the judgment of April 14, 1931, against the American Surety Company and in favor of Dugas in his earlier suit in the state court was based entirely on the qualifying bond of February 12, 1930, given by the Lumbermen's Reciprocal Association as principal and the American Surety Company as surety; that by the decree of September 19, 1932, in the interpleader suit, to which Dugas was a party, the American Surety Company was declared to have complied with all of its obligations under the qualifying bond and was released and discharged from any and all further liability on account thereof; that by that decree Dugas was enjoined from instituting or prosecuting in any other court any suit against the American Surety Company on account of any right or claim growing out of such bond; that Dugas' suit in the state court against the New York Casualty Company was brought on the appeal bond given by the American Surety Company as principal and the New York Casualty Company as surety on the appeal taken by the American Surety Company from the judg- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 422]\n\u00a0\n ment of April 14, 1931, on the qualifying bond; that if Dugas should collect any sum from the New York Casualty Company in his suit against it as surety on the appeal bond, the American Surety Company, as principal on that bond, would be bound to reimburse such surety; and that in these circumstances Dugas' suit against the New York Casualty Company was essentially an effort to enforce the judgment of April 14, 1931, which was based solely on the qualifying bond, and therefore was an attempt indirectly to subject the American Surety Company to further liability on account of that bond contrary to the decree of September 19, 1932. Accordingly, and in aid of the decrees in the interpleader suit, the supplemental bill contained prayers for an injunction restraining Dugas from further prosecuting his suit against the New York Casualty Company and for general relief.\n  To the supplemental bill Dugas filed pleas challenging the jurisdiction of the court, its power to enjoin proceedings in the state court, and the sufficiency of the case stated. The pleas were overruled and Dugas answered. Upon the final hearing the court found the facts to be as alleged in the supplemental bill and held that Dugas' suit against the New York Casualty Company as surety on the appeal bond was essentially an effort to enforce against the American Surety Company the judgment which he had obtained against it as surety on the qualifying bond, and therefore was in contravention of the spirit, if not the letter, of the decrees in the interpleader suit; and on that basis the court gave a supplemental decree specifically enjoining Dugas from further prosecuting his suit in the state court against the New York Casualty Company. Dugas appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, one judge dissenting. 82 F.(2d) 953. The case is here on certiorari. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 423]\n\u00a0\n  Messrs. Ignatius Uzzo and M. C. Scharff, both of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n  Mr. Harry McCall, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  1. The amount or penalty of the qualifying bond was $20,000. The surety's obligation was not to Dugas alone, but to the other claimants as well; and this obligation was not to pay all claims regardless of their aggregate, but to pay $20,000 or so much thereof as should be needed, and no more. Because the claims exceeded $20,000, the surety paid that sum into the registry of the federal court, there to abide the court's decree, and at the same time brought in that court its interpleader suit against all claimants, including Dugas, to the end that its liability on the bond might be terminated, and that the rights of the several claimants in the amount of the bond so paid into court might be judicially determined and the fund distributed accordingly.\n  2. The Interpleader Act of 1926, under which that suit was brought, makes provision for the filing in a federal District Court of a bill of interpleader by a surety company which has executed a bond in the sum of $ 500 or more, under which two or more claimants, citizens of different states, assert adverse rights to the penalty; authorizes the payment of the amount of the bond into the registry of the court, there to await such disposal as the court may direct; and further provides in the latter part of section 2 and in section 3:\n'Sec. 2. * * * Notwithstanding any provision of the Judicial Code to the contrary, said court shall have power \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 424]\n\u00a0\n to issue its process for all such claimants and to issue an order of injunction against each of them, enjoining them from instituting or prosecuting any suit or proceeding in any State court or in any other Federal court * * * on such bond * * * until the further order of the court; which process and order of injunction shall be returnable at such time as the said court or a judge thereof shall determine and shall be addressed to and served by the United States marshals for the respective districts wherein said claimants reside or may be found.\n\n'Sec. 3. Said court shall hear and determine the cause and shall discharge the complainant from further liability; and shall make the injunction permanent and enter all such other orders and decrees as may be suitable and proper, and issue all such customary writs as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and enforce the same.' (44 Stat. 416, 417.)\n\n  By plea and answer Dugas objected to being brought into the interpleader suit and grounded the objection upon the judgment, appeal, and appeal bond in his earlier suit in the state court; but the objection was overruled, and the cause proceeded to the rendition of two related decrees.\n  In one decree, given September 19, 1932, the complainant surety, by reason of its payment of the amount of the qualifying bond into the court's registry, was discharged from any and all further liability on account of that bond, and the several claimants, including Dugas, were enjoined from instituting or prosecuting against the complainant surety, so discharged, any suit on account of any claim or right growing out of such bond. In the other decree, given April 20, 1933, the court determined the rights of the several claimants, including Dugas, in the fund paid into the registry, and directed its distribution among them on a pro rata basis-this decree being in exact accord with a stipulated request by all claimants, including Dugas. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 425]\n\u00a0\n  Taken together, the two decrees not only completely terminated the liability of the complainant surety on the qualifying bond, but also fixed the full measure of Dugas' right or claim under the bond, and in necessary effect determined that the judgment, appeal, and appeal bond in his earlier suit in the state court did not put his claim beyond the reach of the interpleader suit, or require that it be dealt with differently from other claims.\n  Plainly the court had jurisdiction of both the subject-matter and the parties. No appeal was taken from either decree. Therefore Dugas was bound by both decrees. Had he exercised his right to appeal, he could have obtained a review of the rulings on his objection to being brought into the suit, on the bearing and effect of the prior judgment and proceedings in the state court, and on the right of the complainant surety to be discharged from further liability in respect of his claim. But these rulings were all made in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction, were subject to challenge and reexamination only on appeal, and became conclusive on him in the absence of an appeal.\n  3. In the interpleader suit there was an actual, complete, and judicially sanctioned payment of the qualifying bond by the surety, and it was on this basis that the surety was discharged from all further liability. While the payment was into the court's registry, and not directly to the claimants, it nevertheless was a lawful and effective payment under the Interpleader Act. In effect, the first decree converted the claims under the bond into claims against the fund paid into the registry; and the second decree, made after a hearing in which all claimants were heard, directed and brought about a distribution of the fund among them according to their ascertained rights.\n  As Dugas' judgment in the state court was based solely on the qualifying bond, the payment of the bond and discharge of the surety, as effected in the interpleader suit, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 426]\n\u00a0\n operated, under recognized principles of law and equity, to extinguish his right under the judgment. He relied on the judgment in his several pleadings and the decrees fixed the measure of his claim conformably to the judgment. Even the costs awarded to him by the judgment were included in the computation. Thus it is plain that the interpleader suit and the decrees therein dealt with his claim as it was embodied in and evidenced by the judgment.\n  4. Whether, in subsequently bringing suit in the state court on the appeal bond, Dugas contravened the fair intendment of the decrees in the interpleader suit is the principal question arising on the supplemental bill. Both courts below answered the question in the affirmative.\n  The appeal bond was in the nature of a security for the satisfaction of the judgment in Dugas' suit on the qualifying bond; and in attempting to enforce this security he obviously was seeking to realize on the judgment. If his right under the judgment was extinguished, he was not entitled to resort to the security; for the relation of one to the other was such that the extinguishment of his right under the judgment terminated his right in the security. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n  It already has been shown in this opinion that his right under the judgment was extinguished by the proceedings and decrees in the interpleader suit.\n  With this understanding of the operation and effect of the decrees in that suit, it becomes plain that Dugas' action in bringing suit on the appeal bond and thereby attempting to realize on the prior judgment, notwithstanding the extinguishment of his rights under it, was in contravention of those decrees. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 427]\n\u00a0\n  His counsel contends otherwise, and seeks to support the contention by pointing out that the injunction did not directly forbid Dugas from suing on the appeal bond, but only from instituting or prosecuting any suit against the complainant surety on account of a right or claim growing out of the qualifying bond. But the injunction, being only one part of the decrees, is not the exclusive criterion of what was determined and effected by them. Its purpose was to forestall anticipated departures, not to limit other provisions or restrict their operation and effect.\n  By the other provisions it was adjudged that the complainant surety had complied with all of its obligations under the bond by paying the amount of the bond into the court's registry; that, by reason of this compliance, it was discharged from any and all further liability on account of the bond; and that the several claimants under the bond, all of whom had been brought in and heard, were entitled to designated portions of the fund so paid into the registry. Under this last provision, each claimant was paid his portion, the fund being thereby exhausted. It also was adjudged that the fact that Dugas' claim was embodied in and evidenced by a judgment did not make it other than a claim under the bond or take it without the reach of the interpleader suit. He acquiesced in that and other rulings; and the amount of his claim and his proportionate share of the fund were fixed conformably to the judgment. He acquiesced also in this, and accepted the share so allotted to him. In this way the other provisions in the decrees accomplished, as they were intended to do, the extinguishment of his right under the judgment; and they did this independently of the injunction.\n  Of the decisions under state interpleader statutes which are cited as if making for a different conclusion, it is enough to say, first, that in none was the statute substantially identical with the federal act of 1926; and, secondly, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 428]\n\u00a0\n that in such as involved questions approximately like those presented to the District Court in the original suit there were locally appropriate applications for the exercise of appellate authority before the rulings became conclusive, which was not the case here.\n  Some reliance is placed on the fact that the suit on the appeal bond was against the surety thereon alone. But this does not make for a different result. As Dugas' right under the judgment was extinguished, he was no more entitled to realize on the judgment by suing the surety on the appeal bond than by suing the principal. Besides, the surety, if cast in the suit and compelled to pay, would be entitled to reimbursement by the principal. The latter, therefore, may be heard to complain in the circumstances shown here.\n  5. The jurisdiction to entertain the supplemental bill is free from doubt. Such a bill may be brught in a federal court in aid of and to effectuate its prior decree to the end either that the decree may be carried fully into execution or that it may be given fuller effect, but subject to the qualification that the relief be not of a different kind or a different principle. \n7\n Such a bill is ancillary and dependent, and therefore the jurisdiction follows that of the original suit, regardless of the citizenship of the parties to the bill or the amount in controversy. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n  6. The power of the court to enjoin Dugas from further prosecuting his suit in the state court on the appeal bond has full support in sections 2 and 3 of the Interpleader Act of 1926 before quoted, as also in settled adjudications \n\n[300 \nU.S. 414\n, 429]\n\u00a0\n respecting the power of a federal court to protect its jurisdiction and decrees. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n  Decree affirmed.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO are of opinion that the decree should be reversed for the reasons stated by SIBLEY, J., in the court below.\n  Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n301 \nU.S. 712\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 273, 44 Stat., Pt. 2, 416.

Duke, pro se.\n Mr. Wm. W. Barron, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below, being divided and in doubt, and desiring the instruction and advice of this court, has certified the following questions of law: \n\n[301 \nU.S. 492, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. May a misdemeanor, for which no infamous punishment is prescribed, be prosecuted by information, where the punishment therefor may exceed $ 500 fine or six months' imprisonment, without hard labor, or both?\n\n'2. May an offense under section 137 of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C.A .  243) be prosecuted by information?'\n\n The certificate contains the following statement of facts:\n'This was a prosecution for violation of section 137 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  243, which provides:\n\n\"Whoever shall attempt to influence the action or decision of any grand or petit juror of any court of the United States upon any issue or matter pending before such juror, or before the jury of which he is a member, or pertaining to his duties, by writing or sending to him any letter or any communication, in print or writing, in relation to such issue or matter, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.'\n\n'The prosecution was by information filed under oath by the United States Attorney. The appellant was convicted of the offense charged and from judgment and sentence thereon appeals to this court. One of the questions presented by the appeal is whether the offense charged, which is punishable by six months imprisonment or fine of $1,000, or both, may be prosecuted by information, in view of section 335 of the Criminal Code ( amended by Act Dec. 16, 1930, 18 U.S.C.A.  541). ...\n\n'Notwithstanding the decision in Thorm v. United States (C.C.A.3rd) 59 F.(2d) 419, certiorari denied \n287 \nU.S. 624\n, 53 S.Ct. 78, this court is divided and in doubt as to whether a misdemeanor may be prosecuted by information where the punishment therefor, although not infamous, may exceed a fine of five hundred dollars, or six months' imprisonment without hard labor, or both. As there are a large number of such misdemeanors denounced by the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 492, 494]\n\u00a0\n Criminal Code (see Hearings before House Judiciary Committee, Seventieth Congress, First Session, January 17, 1928, on H.R. 5608, H.R. 8230, H.R. 8555, H.R. 8556, Serial 1, Page 31) the court deems the question of sufficient importance to certify to the Supreme Court.'\n\n Section 335 of the Criminal Code, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1088, 1152 (18 U.S. C.A.  541), before its amendment, provided: 'All offenses which may be punished by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, shall be deemed felonies. All other offenses shall be deemed misdemeanors.'\n This section was amended by the Act of December 16, 1930, c. 15, 46 Stat. 1029, 18 U.S.C.  541 (18 U.S.C.A.  541), by adding the following proviso: 'Provided, That all offenses the penalty for which does not exceed confinement in a common jail, without hard labor for a period of six months, or a fine of not more than $500, or both, shall be deemed to be petty offenses; and all such petty offenses may be prosecuted upon information or complaint.'\n Appellant contends that this language limits the authority to prosecute by information strictly to those offenses punishable as the proviso prescribes. Under the original section, there is no doubt that the offense with which appellant is charged was a misdemeanor which could be prosecuted by information. It will be enough to cite as examples supporting this conclusion Falconi v. United States (C.C.A.) 280 F. 766, and Hunter v. United States (C.C.A.) 272 F. 235, 238, where other cases are collected. We think the proviso relied upon did not change this rule.\n The original section divides crimes into felonies and misdemeanors. The evident object of the proviso was to bring about a subdivision of misdemeanors by creating a class of misdemeanors of minor gravity to be known as petty offenses; to be tried, as proposed by other legislation ( which failed), by United States Commissioners. The addition of the words that 'such petty offenses may be prosecuted upon information or complaint' did not work a change of the then well-settled rule that any mis- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n demeanor not involving infamous punishment might be prosecuted by information instead of by indictment. The quoted words probably were inserted, as the government contends and the legislative history indicates, merely to supplement and aid the other proposed legislation then pending to which we have referred; but, in any event, they are affirmative words and do not in terms or by reasonable implication negative the broader long- standing rule in respect of misdemeanors of the other class. Thorm v. United States (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 419. The offense with which appellant was charged was not a petty offense within the proviso, but it was a misdemeanor of a kind, as the certificate recites, not subject to infamous punishment-therefore open to prosecution by information.\n Both interrogatories must be answered in the affirmative.\n Question No. 1, Yes.\n Question No. 2, Yes. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUPONT V.

Whether the tax is payable upon a broker's transfer of a customer's account in cotton futures to another broker through the cotton exchange is the matter in controversy. The Circuit Court of Appeals has held the transaction taxable. \n2\n A conflict of decision moved us to grant certiorari. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n  Petitioners are members of a partnership trading on the New York Cotton Exchange. On behalf of a customer they purchased cotton for future delivery. They were instructed by the customer to transfer the account to other brokers. To accomplish this petitioners delivered a 'sold' memorandum to the transferee of the account, who, in turn, delivered a 'bought' memorandum to the petitioners. No commission was charged because the instructions to transfer had been given at petitioners' request, as they desired to be relieved of the account. In order to record such a transfer with the exchange the custom was to use bought and sold memoranda in the form invariably employed by members of the exchange in purchase and sale of cotton for future delivery. The petitioners affixed to the sold memorandum stamps in the proper amount and, after denial of a refund, brought action for the amount of the tax. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 150\n, 152]\n\u00a0\n  The petitioners contend that no sale, agreement of sale or agreement to sell was in fact made, though for convenience, and because of lack of other medium to evidence the transfer, papers in form agreements of sale were employed. The government insists that the tax is essentially upon the privilege of using the facilities of an exchange and petitioners here exercised this privilege and a sale was in fact made. We hold the tax was lawfully imposed and the petitioners are not entitled to recover the value of the stamps.\n  1. The transaction was not a 'scratch' or 'transferred' sale within the meaning of the exemption found in the section. A scratch or transferred sale is one in which there is an offsetting purchase and sale at the same price on the same day. Where a broker, in order to fill a customer's order, buys a larger amount and sells the excess to a third broker, directing the selling broker to deliver the excess to the broker who has purchased it, and directing the broker who purchases the excess to take delivery from the selling broker, the name of the intermediate broker is erased from the records of the exchange so that the sale of the excess appears as a sale direct from the one to the other of the two remaining brokers. The exemption also covers trading by a scalping broker who makes his profit in fractional movements on the exchange, buying and selling with great rapidity, thus often purchasing and selling the same amount of the commodity at the same price within a few moments or hours. By agreement amongst the members his name is scratched out of the records of the exchange and his temporary rights and liabilities do not appear upon its records. Accordingly, the Treasury Regulations in force since 1918 require that purchase and sale be consummated on the same day if the exemption is to apply \n\n[300 \nU.S. 150\n, 153]\n\u00a0\n and that the intermediate broker instruct the broker who sold to him to deliver to the other who bought from him. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n  2. The tax is not upon the business transacted but is an excise upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business. It is an excise upon the facilities used in the transaction of the business separate and apart from the business itself. \n5\n In this view it is immaterial whether the transfer of the account constituted a sale. Unquestionably the petitioners used the facilities of the exchange for offsetting their obligation as a purchasing broker by arranging that another broker should take over that obligation under the rules of the exchange. Such a transaction comes within the intent of the statute and renders petitioners liable for the tax.\n  3. Under the rules and practice of the Cotton Exchange the transaction taxed was an actual sale. The fact that the sale was made for the purpose of transferring a brokerage account is irrelevant. When the petitioners purchased on the exchange the future contracts for their customer the selling broker handed the petitioners a memorandum agreeing to deliver at the date and price therein specified and the petitioners gave the selling broker a similar purchase memorandum. This each was required to do by the bylaws of the exchange. As a result of the operations of the clearing house the petitioners would, at the close of the day's business, be under obligation to pay the clearing house upon delivery being made at the future date and they would have a correlative right to receive from the clearing house the cotton purchased. Although the broker who made the sale to the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 150\n, 154]\n\u00a0\n petitioners would have a right to receive from his principal the necessary cotton to make delivery according to the sale, and although the petitioners who had bought the cotton would be under an obligation to their customer to deliver to him, both brokers were, under the by-laws of the exchange, principals in the transaction. When, therefore, the customer ordered the transfer of the account the petitioners could only effect this by selling the futures to the substituted broker who, in turn, became obligated, so far as the exchange was concerned, as principal, to accept delivery of the cotton according to his purchase from the petitioners. The obligation assumed by the petitioners when they entered into purchase contracts could be satisfied by making payment to the clearing house or offset by selling to another broker and so obtaining that broker's contract to take delivery of the cotton from the clearing house. In no other way could the petitioners relieve themselves of that obligation.\n  The judgment is\n  Affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 \nU.S.C.  903, 26 \nU.S.C.A.  903.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 83 F.(2d) 951, certiorari granted \n299 \nU.S. 531, 81\n L.

OF JOLIET V. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL(1937)\nNo. 255\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n  Mr. Elden McFarland, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n  Mr. Thurman Arnold, of New Haven, Conn., for respondent. [ Elmhurst Cemetery Co. of Joliet v. Comm. of Internal Revenue   \n300 \nU.S. 37\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 37\n, 38]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Petitioner, in 1909, purchased one hundred and thirty-seven acres of land near Joliet, Ill., for $60,000. Thirty-seven acres were divided into plots and developed for cemetery purposes by grading, constructing drives, planting shrubbery, etc., at a cost of $35,000. Grave plots, varying in area from 150 to 1,500 square feet, were sold from time to time under contracts for perpetual care.\n  Some 36,000 square feet were disposed of during the years 1909 to 1913 at prices ranging from 70.2 cents to 79.5 cents. The average between March 1, 1912, and March 1, 1913, was 76.6 cents. In the three years 1926, 1927, and 1928, 42,000 square feet were sold for $1.55 to $1.77. To determine the taxable gains realized from the latter sales, it became necessary to ascertain the value of the lots as of March 1, 1913. The petitioner's return estimated this at 76.6 cents. The Commissioner adopted 23.96 cents and assessed deficiencies accordingly.\n  Upon petition for redetermination the Board of Tax Appeals, after considering the evidence, approved the 76.6 cents valuation and found no deficiencies. The evidence consisted of a stipulation by counsel concerning sales in 1909 to 1913 as detailed above, and the testimony of the cemetery superintendent.\n  He stated the original cost of the one hundred and thirty-seven acres, expense of development, area sold in 1926, 1927, 1928, and prices obtained. He affirmed familiarity with the property on March 1, 1913, prices then prevailing, and stated that the sales of 1912 and 1913 were in normal course without extra effort. Also that 'the purchase price was established by my visiting \n\n[300 \nU.S. 37\n, 39]\n\u00a0\n a good many cemeteries that I figured were practically of the same class as that cemetery and situated near cities of about the same population, and I established a price from the price they were selling at.' Further that 'every grave and lot in the cemetery sold since its organization is under perpetual care, and when perpetual care is provided, it means keeping the roads and drives in proper repair, keeping the drainage system in propoer repair, keeping the fences in repair, cutting the grass, pruning the trees, shrubs, and keeping it in good condition.' 'We hoped for a gradual increase in sales every year because as a general rule, for every head of a family that is buried you secure four new families. That is the rule cemetery companies have adopted.' He thought it might take seventy-five years to dispose of all lots.\n  The Board declared 'the parties are now concerned only with the value as of March 1, 1913, of that thirty-seven acres of petitioner's lands which have been improved and from which sales have been made.' 'Beyond statements of counsel to the effect that respondent (Commissioner) has attempted by formula to reduce the value of the improved land as of March 1, 1913, to present value, we are uninformed as to the method by which he chose the figures at which he fixes the basis for determining gain. Petitioner, however, has chosen as the footage valuation as of March 1, 1913, the selling price of its grave lots during the year just preceding that date-76.6 cents-which is less than the average sales price during the month of March, 1913. We are of opinion that the valuation for which petitioner contends is reasonable and should be allowed. It is based upon actual sales, and consequently comes as closely as may be to that fair market value, so often judicially defined as the price which property will bring when offered by a willing seller to a willing buyer, neither being obligated to buy or sell.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 37\n, 40]\n\u00a0\n  Lots disposed of in 1912 and 1913 went with agreements for perpetual care; so did those sold in 1926, 1927, and 1928; prices obtained in the latter years may be compared with those received in the earlier ones-they were for like things.\n  The Commissioner asked review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. He there urged that March 1, 1913, values should be ascertained by discounting sale prices during the preceding twelve months because of the time which would be required in order to dispose of the whole. The Court said: 'The facts in this case necessitate the rejection of the selling price as the sole determinator of value. Far more equitable is the selling price less discount for years required to realize said selling price.' 'The Commissioner was liberal with the taxpayer.' Accordingly it reversed the Board and directed affirmance of the Commissioner's assessment.\n  This action, we think, amounted to an unwarranted substitution of the Court's judgment concerning facts for that of the Board. There was substantial evidence, as appears above, to support the latter's conclusion, and in such circumstances this must be accepted. It is the function of the Board to weigh the evidence and declare the result. We undertook to state the applicable rule in Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 736, and General Utilities & Operating Company v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 187.\n  The judgment here complained of must be reversed. The action of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.\n  Reversed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORP. v. BRYANT(1937)\nNo. 155\nArgued: November 20, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n Where service of process against defendant, removing cause to federal court for diversity of citizenship was invalid and defendant declined to appear voluntarily and had no agent on which service could be had within district where suit was pending, federal court was without jurisdiction to proceed with suit.\n Messrs. J. \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 375]\n\u00a0\n P. Adoue, of Houston, Tex., and John D. Watkins, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves an effort to obtain by mandamus and prohibition a re-examination and vacation of an order of a federal District Court remanding to a state court a suit theretofore removed into the former from the latter. \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 376]\n\u00a0\n A citizen of Texas sued a corporate citizen of Missouri in a state court of Gregg county, Tex., to recover a sum in excess of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, upon a policy of workmen's compensation insurance, and caused process to be issued out of that court and served upon an alleged agent of the defendant. Without otherwise appearing in the state court, the defendant in due time and mode caused the suit to be removed, by reason of the diverse citizenship of the parties, into the federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Gregg county.\n After the removal the defendant, appearing specially, showed that the alleged agent upon whom process had been served prior to the removal was not in fact its agent, and the federal court set aside the service. At the plaintiff's instance further process was issued out of that court and served upon an agent of the defendant within the Western-not Eastern- District of Texas. Again appearing specially, the defendant challenged this service because made outside the court's territorial jurisdiction, and the service was set aside.\n Obtaining the removal from the state court into the federal court did not operate as a general appearance by the defendant1 and, as the service of process against it proved invalid and it declined to appear voluntarily, the federal court plainly was without personal jurisdiction of the defendant, although in other respects having jurisdiction of the suit.\n The defendant had been admitted to do, and was doing, business in Texas, had an agent within the Western District upon whom process could be served in that district, but had no agent within the Eastern District where the suit was pending. \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 377]\n\u00a0\n The suit was in personam and not within any exceptional provision empowering the federal court to send its process outside its district. Therefore that court's process could be effectively served only within the district. \n2\n But the state court was not subject to such a limitation and could send its process to any part of the state.\n In these circumstances the plaintiff moved that the suit be remanded to the state court because the federal court was without, and unable to obtain, personal jurisdiction of the defendant; and in support of the motion the plaintiff asserted that the defendant had not been effectively served with process, had not voluntarily appeared, and had no agent within the district upon whom process could be served. Coming to act upon this motion, the federal court construed section 80, title 28, U.S.Code (28 U.S. C.A.  80), as authorizing it either to dismiss the suit or to remand the same to the state court, as justice might require; concluded that justice required a remanding order because 'an order of dismissal would prevent plaintiff from refiling (beginning anew) his suit within the time permitted by the statute of Texas and would amount to a complete denial of his right to litigate the claim'; and accordingly entered an order remanding the suit to the state court.\n The defendant, conceiving that the remanding order was wrongly made, petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for writs of mandamus and prohibition commanding the judge of the District Court to vacate that order and prohibiting him from giving any effect to it. The Circuit Court of Appeals entertained the petition, ordered the judge to show cause why the requested writs should not issue, received and considered his return disclosing the proceedings and matters already recited, and denied the petition. In re Employers Reinsurance Corporation, 82 F.(2d) 373. The case is here on certiorari. \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 378]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion the petition was rightly denied, first, because the remanding order was not subject to appellate re-examination on petition for mandamus or otherwise, and, secondly, because even if open to re- examination on petition for mandamus, the order was made in the exercise of lawful authority and was appropriate to the situation in which it was made.\n\n 1. \nFor a long period an order of a federal court remanding a cause to the state court whence it had been removed could not be re-examined on writ of error or appeal, because not a final judgment or decree in the sense of the controlling statute. \n3\n But in occasional instances such an order was re-examined in effect on petition for mandamus, and this on the theory that the order, if erroneous, amounted to a wrongful refusal to proceed with the cause and that in the absence of other adequate remedy mandamus was appropriate to compel the inferior court to exercise its authority. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n By the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 472, dealing with the jurisdiction of the circuit (now district) courts, Congress provided, in section 5, that if a circuit court should be satisfied at any time during the pendency of a suit brought therein, or removed thereto from a state court, that 'such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within' its 'jurisdiction,' the court should proceed no further therein, but should 'dismiss the suit or remand it to the court from which it was removed as justice may require.' \n5\n Thus far this section did little more than to make mandatory a practice theretofore largely followed, but sometimes neg \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 379]\n\u00a0\n lected, in the circuit courts. \n6\n But the section also contained a concluding paragraph, wholly new, providing that the order 'dismissing or remanding said cause to the State court' should be reviewable on writ of error or appeal. This provision for an appellate review continued in force until it was expressly repealed by the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373,  6, 24 Stat. 552, 7 which also provided that an order remanding a cause to a state court should be 'immediately carried into execution' and 'no appeal or writ of error' from the order should be allowed. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The question soon arose whether the provisions just noticed in the Act of March 3, 1887, should be taken broadly as excluding remanding orders from all appellate review, regardless of how invoked, or only as forbidding their review on writ of error or appeal. The question was considered and answered by this Court in several cases, the uniform ruling being that the provisions should be construed and applied broadly as prohibiting appellate re-examination of such an order, where made by a circuit (now district) court regardless of the mode in which the re- examination is sought. \n9\n A leading case on the subject \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 380]\n\u00a0\n is In re Pennsylvania Company, \n137 \nU.S. 451\n, 11 S.Ct. 141, which dealt with a petition for mandamus requiring the judges of a circuit court to reinstate, try, and adjudicate a suit which they, in the circuit court, had remanded to the state court whence it had been removed. After referring to the earlier statutes and practice and coming to the Act of March 3, 1887, this Court said (\n137 U.S. 451\n, at page 454, 11 S.Ct. 141, 142):\n'In terms, it only abolishes appeals and writs of error, it is true, and does not mention writs of mandamus; and it is unquestionably a general rule that the abrogation of one remedy does not affect another. But in this case, we think, it was the intention of congress to make the judgment of the circuit court remanding a cause to the state court final and conclusive. The general object of the act is to contract the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The abrogation of the writ of error and appeal would have had little effect in putting an end to the question of removal, if the writ of mandamus could still have been sued out in this court. It is true that the general supervisory power of this court over inferior jurisdictions is of great moment in a public point of view, and should not, upon light grounds, be deemed to be taken away in any case. Still, although the writ of mandamus is not mentioned in the section, yet the use of the words, 'such remand shall be immediately carried into execution,' in addition to the prohibition of appeal and writ of error, is strongly indicative of an intent to suppress further prolongation of the controversy by whatever process. We are, therefore, of opinion that the act has the effect of taking away the remedy by mandamus as well as that of appeal and writ of error.'\n\n The provisions in the act of 1887 on which that decision and others to the same effect were based are still in force as parts of sections 71 and 80, title 28, U.S.Code (28 U.S.C.A.  71, 80). They are in pari materia, are to be construed accordingly rather than as distinct enactments, and, when so construed, show, as was held in Morey v. Lockhart, 123 U.S. \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 381]\n\u00a0\n 56, 58, 8 S.Ct. 65, that they are intended to reach and include all cases removed from a state court into a federal court and remanded by the latter.\n It follows that the remanding order of the District Court was not subject to re-examination by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the petition for mandamus.\n\n 2. \nIt is conceded, and rightly so, that the District Court was without personal jurisdiction of the defendant, and that in the absence of such jurisdiction the court was without power to proceed to an adjudication. The statute, section 80 supra, requires that a District Court, when satisfied that a suit removed into it from a state court does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy 'properly' within its jurisdiction, shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the state court, as justice may require. In this instance the dispute or controversy was not properly within the jurisdiction of the District Court unless (1) the parties were citizens of different states; (2) the value or amount involved exceeded $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and (3) the defendant was before the court by reason of a general appearance or a valid service of process. \n10\n Each of these elements of jurisdiction was essential, and if any was wanting there was an absence of proper jurisdiction. The defendant was not before the court, and therefore it was without jurisdiction to proceed with the suit. Counsel for the petitioner assume that the presence of the defendant was not \n\n[299 U.S. 374, 382]\n\u00a0\n an element of the court's jurisdiction as a federal court; but the assumption is a mistaken one. By repeated decisions in this Court it has been adjudged that the presence of the defendant in a suit in personam, such as the one now under discussion, is an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district (formerly circuit) court as a federal court,11 and that in the absence of this element the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.\n In the circumstances already recited the District Court was required to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction or to remand it to the state court from which it had been removed, and in selecting between these alternatives the court was required to act 'as justice may require.' The statute assumes that justice will be better served in some instances by a dismissal and in others by a remand. Making the required selection involves discretion-judicial discretion, not mere choice. Plainly the circumstances in which the court acted pointed to a remand as being, in justice, the more appropriate of the alternatives. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n It follows that, even if a remanding order were open to re- examination on a petition for mandamus, the petition was in this instance rightly denied.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Wabash Western Ry. v.

The Commission, after service of a complaint, and extensive hearings, made a finding of facts from the testimony and ordered two corporation respondents and three individuals controlling these corporations, to desist from certain practices used by respondents in furthering the sale of encyclopedias and other books in interstate commerce. The Commission not only found the practices to be 'unfair' but also 'false, deceptive and misleading.' The court below modified and weakened the Commission's order in material aspects, and the questions here are whether the testimony supported all the findings of the Commission, and whether these findings justified the entire order as against all the respondents.\n All 'unfair' practices found by the Commission related wholly to methods of sale. The Commission's order against respondents was based, in part, upon the following findings: \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n That fictitious testimonials and recommendations had been used by respondents; that authorized testimonials and recommendations had been exaggerated and garbled; that authorized testimonials for a 'previous work' were later used to further the sale of another 'work, quite different in form, in material and in purpose.' 'For the purpose of selling their publications, Standard Reference Work and New Standard Encyclopedia' respondents advertised 'a list headed 'Contributors and Reviewers' and ... In such list they include many who have not been either contributors or reviewers to either the Standard Reference Work or the New Standard Encyclopedia.' Respondents sold 'their publications at retail to the public by salesmen on the subscription plan' and in carrying out said plan they represented to prospects that they were selecting a small list of 'well connected representative people' in various localities, in order to present them with an 'artcraft deluxe edition' of the encyclopedia. Further carrying out respondents' scheme, their agents represented that 'they are giving away a set of books; that they are not selling anything; that the books are free; that the books are being given free as an advertising plan ... that the prospect has been specially selected, and that the only return desired for the gift is permission to use the name of the prospect for advertising purposes and as a reference'; that the 'said prospects are paying only for the loose leaf extension service; ... that the price of $69.50 is a reduced price and that the regular price of the books and the extension service is $150.00, sometimes even as high as $200.00.' The statements that the encyclopedia is being given away; that payment is only being made 'for the loose leaf extension service'; and that '$69.50 is a reduced price ... are false, deceptive and misleading as $69.50 is the regular, standard price' for both the encyclopedia and the loose leaf extension and research privileges. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals reversed clauses 1 and 3 of the Commission's order. These clauses ordered respondents not to represent falsely to purchasers of their publications that the publishing company was giving encyclopedias to them as a gift, and that purchasers were paying only for loose leaf supplements.\n The Court of Appeals affirmed clauses 2 and 6 of the Commission's order. These clauses ordered respondents not to represent falsely to purchasers that sets of books had 'been reserved to be given away free of cost to selected persons' and that the usual price at which respondents' publications are sold is higher than the price 'at which they are offered to such purchasers.'\n It is clear, both from the findings of the Commission, and the testimony upon which they rest, that the practices forbidden in clauses 1, 2, 3, and 6 are all tied together as parts of the same sales plan. As a first step under this plan, salesmen obtained an audience with prospective purchasers by representations made to them that by reason of their prestige and influence they had been selected by the company to receive a set of books free of costs for advertising purposes. After respondents' agents thus gained an audience by the promise of a free set of books, they then moved forward under the same general sales plan, by falsely representing that the regular price of the loose leaf supplement alone was $ 69.50, and that the usual price of both books and loose leaf supplements was much in excess of $69.50. The Commission ordered respondents not to engage in carrying out any part of this entire sale plan. However, as the Court of Appeals reversed clauses 1 and 3 of the Commission's order, a part of the sales scheme which the Commission condemned as unfair can yet be carried out by respondents. That is to say-respondents, by that reversal, are left free to continue to obtain audiences with prospects and to sell encyclopedias and loose leaf supple- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n ments to them, by false representations that the company gives them a set of encyclopedias free, and that $69.50 paid by them to the company is for the loose leaf supplement alone.\n In reaching the conclusion that respondents should be left free to engage in that part of the sales scheme prohibited by clauses 1 and 3 of the Commission's order, the court below (86 F.(2d) 692, 695) reasoned as follows: 'We cannot take too seriously the suggestion that a man who is buying a set of books and a ten years' 'extension service' will be fatuous enough to be misled by the mere statement that the first are given away, and that he is paying only for the second. ... Such trivial niceties are too impalpable for practical affairs, they are will-o'-the-wisps, which divert attention from substantial evils.'\n The fact that a false statement may be obviously false to those who are trained and experienced does not change its character, nor take away its power to deceive others less experienced. There is no duty resting upon a citizen to suspect the honesty of those with whom he transacts business. Laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious. The best element of business has long since decided that honesty should govern competitive enterprises, and that the rule of caveat emptor should not be relied upon to reward fraud and deception.\n The practice of promising free books where no free books were intended to be given, and the practice of deceiving unwary purchasers into the false belief that loose leaf supplements alone sell for $69.50, when in reality both books and supplement regularly sell for $69.50, are practices contrary to decent business standards. To fail to prohibit such evil practices would be to elevate deception in business and to give to it the standing and dignity of truth. It was clearly the practice of respondents through their agents, in accordance with a well matured plan, to mislead customers into the belief that they \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n were given an encyclopedia, and that they paid only for the loose leaf supplement. That representations were made justifying this belief; that the plan was outlined in letters going directly from the companies; that men and women were deceived by them-there can be little doubt. Certainly the Commission was justified from the evidence in finding that customers were misled. Testimony in the record from citizens of ten states-teachers, doctors, college professors, club women, business men-proves beyond doubt that the practice was not only the commonly accepted sales method for respondents' encyclopedias, but that it successfully deceived and deluded its victims.\n The courts do not have a right to ignore the plain mandate of the statute which makes the findings of the Commission conclusive as to the facts if supported by testimony. \n1\n The courts cannot pick and choose bits of evidence to make findings of fact contrary to the findings of the Commission. The record in this case is filled with evidence of witnesses under oath which support the Commission's findings. Clauses 1 and 3 of the Commission's order should be sustained and enforced.\n The seventh clause of the Commission's order forbade the use of names of persons as contributors or editors who had not consented to such use and who had neither actually contributed to the publications nor helped to edit them.\n The Court of Appeals upheld this clause except as it might apply to the original contributors to Aiton's encyclopedia, saying that 'it seems to us not 'unfair' to announce as contributors to the derived works those who have been contributors to the original.' Aiton's encyclopedia was published about 1909, and respondents' works represent the result of periodic revisions and expansions of the prior work. The government concedes in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n its brief that this clause of the Commission's order does not prevent respondents from representing a person who contributed to the original, as a contributor to their revised publication, if 'some of the material originally in Aiton's encyclopedia remained in the new Edition of the revised work.' Respondents agree with this interpretation. As between these parties, therefore, this clause permits respondents to represent any person as a contributor to their present revised encyclopedia, if a part of his original material has been carried forward to it. If no part of his contribution to Aiton's encyclopedia has been brought forward, he is not a contributor and should not be represented as such. This clause as originally declared by the Commission would, under this interpretation, properly forbid respondents from falsely representing as contributors or editors those who had actually neither contributed to, nor edited, the publications. The decree of the court below modifying this clause is not in accordance with our conclusion, and clause 7 of the Commission's order should be enforced.\n The Court of Appeals reversed the eighth clause of the order of the Commission. The reason given by the court below for this action was as follows: 'For the eighth, which forbade the use of such testimonials which had not been given by the person whose name was used, we have been able to find no support in the evidence.'\n We are convinced that the Commission's findings of fact justified this clause of the order and that the testimony supports these findings. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals entirely excluded respondent Greener from the operation of the Commission's order, and partially excluded respondents Stanford and Ward. The Commission had found from the testimony that 'Respondents H. M. Stanford, W. H. Ward, and A. J. Greener are the managers and sole stockholders of respondent Standard Education Society, and the managers and sole incorporators of Respondent Standard Encyclopedia Corporation ... The Commission concludes and infers from the record in this case and so finds that this corporation was organized by the individual respondents for the purpose of evading any order that might be issued by the Federal Trade Commission against the respondent, the Standard Education Society.'\n There was ample support in the testimony for this finding of the Commission.\n The Federal Trade Commission Act (supra) gives the Commission power to 'prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, ... from using unfair methods of competition in commerce.'\n This Court has held that 'a command to the corporation is in effect a command to those who are officially responsible for the conduct of its affairs. If they, apprised of the writ directed to the corporation, prevent compliance ... they, no less than the corporation itself, are guilty of disobedience, and may be punished for contempt.' Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 376\n, 31 S.Ct. 538, 543, Ann.Cas. 1912D, 558.\n Respondents Stanford, Ward and Greener, who are in charge and control of the affairs of respondent corporations, would be bound by a cease and desist order rendered against the corporations. Since circumstances, disclosed by the Commission's findings and the testimony, are such that further efforts of these individual respondents to evade orders of the Commission might be anticipated, it was proper for the Commission to include them in its cease and desist order. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n The record in this case discloses closely held corporations owned, dominated and managed by these three individual respondents. In this management these three respondents acted with practically the same freedom as though no corporation had existed. So far as corporate action was concerned, these three were the actors. Under the circumstances of this proceeding, the Commission was justified in reaching the conclusion that it was necessary to include respondents Stanford, Ward and Greener in each part of its order if it was to be fully effective in preventing the unfair competitive practices which the Commission had found to exist. The court below was in error in excluding these respondents from the operation of the Commission's order.\n The decree below will be reversed except as to modification of clause 10 of the Commission's order, and the cause is remanded with instructions to proceed in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n302 \nU.S. 779\n, 58 S.Ct. 365, 82 L.Ed. --; Motion to amend opinion denied \n302 \nU.S. 661\n, 58 S.Ct. 474, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Federal Trade Commission Act, Sept. 26, 1914, 38 Stat. 717, U.S.C. title 15,  45 (15 U.S.C.A.  45). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] From paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Commission's findings it appears that respondents used the names of various individuals in testimonials and that 'None of these men or this woman ever wrote any testimonial or recommendation of or concerning the New Standard Encyclopedia.

OF MARYLAND v. PINK(1937)\nNo. 38\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harold L. Smith and Ralph S. Harris, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Irvin Waldman and Alfred C. Bennett, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1930 Southern Surety Company, a New York corporation, issued to John De Martini Company, Inc., a fidelity insurance bond and on the same day reinsured half of the risk with petitioner, Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland. The De Martini Company claimed a loss. While this was in course of adjustment (March, 1932), a New York court adjudged the Southern Company insolvent and dissolved it. Respondent Pink, Superintendent of Insurance for New York, took possession of its property and entered upon liquidation of the business.\n He allowed, but did not discharge, the De Martini Company's claim. Thereupon he demanded that petitioner pay half of it. This having been refused, he instituted \n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n these proceedings in the United States District Court to recover upon the reinsurance contract. Judgment went in his favor; the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed; the matter is here upon certiorari. The facts are not in dispute.\n The contract between the two insurance companies incorporated the 'standard form of reinsurance agreement' adopted by the Surety Association of America in 1930. This form provides:\n'In consideration of the premium payable under section 1 hereof ____ hereinafter called the Reinsurer, does hereby reinsure Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland, hereinafter called the Reinsured, under bond numbered ____, together with all riders attached thereto, hereinafter called the Bond, issued by the Reinsured in the penalty of ____ Dollars, in favor of ____ (obligee), and in behalf of ____ hereinafter called the Principal, against loss thereunder and against costs and expenses, as hereinafter defined, and interest. A copy of the bond is or may be attached hereto, and is hereby made a part of this agreement.\n\n'The foregoing agreement is subject to the following conditions and provisions: (These appear in fifteen succeeding sections.)'\n\n Section 4, copied in the margin,1 contains the following, among other things:\n'The Reinsurer's proportionate share of a loss under the bond, of costs and expenses as hereinafter defined, and of interest, shall be paid to the Reinsured upon proof of the payment of such items by the Reinsured, and upon delivery to the Reinsurer of copies of all essential documents concerned with such loss and costs and the payment thereof. The Reinsured may, however, give the Reinsurer written notice of its intention to pay the loss on a certain date, and may require the Reinsurer to have \n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n its share of such loss in the hands of the Reinsured by such date; provided, however, that the Reinsurer in any event shall have a period of forty-eight hours, after the receipt of such written notice from the Reinsured, to mail or otherwise despatch its payment; and provided further that in any such case the Reinsurer, if it desires to do so, may pay its share of the loss by means of a check drawn in favor of the obligee of the bond.'\n\n Petitioner's counsel maintain that the standard form provides for insurance only 'against loss'; that the reinsurer thereunder becomes liable only upon 'proof of the payment of such items by the Reinsured, and upon delivery to the Reinsurer of copies of all essential documents concerned with such loss and costs and the payment thereof'; that payment by the reinsured is a condition precedent to the reinsurer's liability. Sundry provisions in the form, indicated below, they say lend support to this view. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 228]\n\u00a0\n Respondent maintains that proof of payment is not a prerequisite to recover.\n Both courts below thought that Allemannia Fire Insurance Company v. Firemen's Insurance Company (1908), \n209 \nU.S. 326\n, 28 S.Ct. 544, 14 Ann.Cas. 948,\n__________ fective at the time of any breach of the bond resulting in a claim thereunder; such retention to be carried under any blanket bond or bonds issued and\/or any blanket bond reinsurance or reinsurances carried by the Reinsured in favor of the same insured. The actual retained liability of the Reinsured as aforesaid shall not be more than that ceded to the Reinsurer, whether it be primary or excess or partly primary and partly excess. ...'\n Section 4:\n'... The Reinsurer's proportionate share of a loss under the bond, of costs and expenses as hereinafter defined, and of interest, shall be paid to the Reinsured upon proof of the payment of such items by the Reinsured, and upon delivery to the Reinsurer of copies of all essential documents concerned with such loss and costs and the payment thereof. The Reinsured may, however, give the Reinsurer written notice of its intention to pay the loss on a certain date, and may require the Reinsurer to have its share of such loss in the hands of the Reinsured by such date: provided, however, that the Reinsurer in any event shall have a period of forty-eight hours, after the receipt of such written notice from the Reinsured, to mail or otherwise despatch its payment; and provided further that in any such case the Reinsurer, if it desires to do so, may pay its share of the loss by means of a check drawn in favor of the obligee on the bond.\n\n'The Reinsurer may inspect the original documents relating to claims and losses under the bond in the possession of the Reinsured.\n\n'The term costs and expenses shall mean all expenditures made in investigating and settling any claim under the bond; all expenditures made in procuring or attempting to procure restitution or recovery on account of any loss, costs, or expenses: and all expenditures made in prosecuting or attempting to prosecute any person causing a loss under the bond.'\n\n Section 10:\n'The Reinsurer shall be entitled to share with the Reinsured, in the proportion defined in section 2 hereof, any collateral security or indemnity held by the Reinsured. ...' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 229]\n\u00a0\n required approval of respondent's contention. This was error. The defense was well taken and should have been sustained.\n\n We do not question the general rules concerning liability of reinsurers announced in the Allemannia Case; but the liability under any written contract must be determined upon consideration of the words employed, read in the light of attending circumstances.\n Here the two insurance companies stood upon an equal footing; both were experts in the field. The language used differs materially from that found in the policy of the Allemannia Company. There is no ambiguity and no circumstance requires disregard of the ordinary meaning of the language.\n The 1930 form provides: 'The Reinsurer does hereby reinsure against loss.' The Allemannia policy declared the company 'hereby agrees to reinsure.'\n Petitioner's policy says: 'The reinsurer's proportionate share of the loss ... shall be paid to the reinsured upon proof of the payment of such items by the reinsured and upon the delivery to the reinsurer of copies of all essential documents concerned with such loss and the payment thereof.' The Allemannia policy contained no equivalent terms. It provided: 'Upon receiving notice of any loss or claim under any contract hereunder reinsured, the said reinsured company shall promptly advise the said Allemannia Fire Insurance Company, at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, of the same, and of the date and probable amount of loss of damage, and after said reinsured company shall have adjusted, accepted proofs of, or paid such loss or damage, it shall forward to the said Allemannia Fire Insurance Company, at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, a proof of its loss and claim against this company upon blanks furnished for that purpose by said Firemen's Insurance Company, together with a copy of the original proofs and claim under its contract re insured, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 224, 230]\n\u00a0\n and a copy of the original receipt taken upon the payment of such loss . ...'\n As the standard form of 1930 was adopted twenty years after the Allemannia Case it fairly may be assumed that the dissimilar language employed was intended to impose liability different from the one there found to exist.\n The judgment below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n302 \nU.S. 780\n, 58 S.Ct. 407, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Introduction-'Does hereby reinsure ____ against loss.'\n Section 3:\n'3.

STATE OF MINNESOTA(1937)\nNo. 647\nArgued: March 31, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota.\n Messrs. Joseph H. Colman, John Junell, and Clark R. Fletcher, all of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellant. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. S. Ervin, of St. Paul, Minn., Frank J. Williams, of Minneapolis, Minn., and Matthias N. Orfield, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, Judicial Code,  237, as amended (28 U.S.C.A.  344), involves the question whether appellant, a Delaware corporation doing business in Minnesota, may be required, consistently with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to pay a property tax laid by Minnesota upon appellant's shares of stock in Montana and North Dakota state banking corporations.\n The trial court concluded that, as the shares are lawfully taxed by Montana and North Dakota, it would be a denial of due process to tax them in Minnesota. The Supreme Court of the state reversed, holding that as appellant has acquired a commercial domicil within the state, and as its shares in the Montana and North Dakota banks are assets of the business carried on by appellant in Minnesota, they are rightly taxed there rather than in Montana or North Dakota. 267 N.W. 519.\n Appellant is qualified to do business in Minnesota, and in fact transacts its corporate business and fiscal affairs there. It maintains a business office within the state and holds there its meetings of stockholders, directors, and their executive committee. It is the owner of a controlling interest in the stock of a large number of banks, trust companies, and other financial institutions, located in the Ninth Federal Reserve District. The stock cer- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n tificates are kept in Minnesota, where appellant receives dividends declared by its subsidiaries, and where it declares and disburses dividends upon its own stock.\n Through a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation, organized and doing business in Minnesota, it maintains a compensated service for the banks which it controls. It offers advice as to their accounting practices, makes recommendations concerning loans, commercial paper and interest rates, and makes suggestions regarding their purchase and sale of securities. It also plans for them advertising campaigns, and supplies advertising material. Appellant thus maintains within the state an integrated business of protecting its investments in bank shares, and enhancing their value, by the active exercise of its power of control through stock ownership of its subsidiary banks.\n Appellant is to be regarded as legally domiciled in Delaware, the place of its organization, and as taxable there upon its intangibles, see Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks County, \n253 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 40 S.Ct. 558; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158, 161\n, 54 S.Ct. 152, 153; Virginia v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., \n293 \nU.S. 15, 19\n, 55 S.Ct. 12, 13, at least in the absence of activities identifying them with some other place as their 'business situs.' But it is plain that the business which appellant carries on in Minnesota, or directs from its offices maintained there, is sufficiently identified with Minnesota to establish a 'commercial domicil' there, and to give a business situs there, for purposes of taxation, to intangibles which are used in the business or are incidental to it, and have thus 'become integral parts of some local business.' Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 203, 210\n, 56 S.Ct. 773, 777; see Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 213\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 101, 65 A.L.R. 1000; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S.Ct. 54, 55; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 331\n, 52 S.Ct. 174, 178, 77 A.L.R. 1401. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n The doctrine that intangibles may be taxed at their business situs, as distinguished from the legal domicil of their owner has usually been applied to obligations to pay money, acquired in the course of a localized business. City of New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S.Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S.Ct. 585, 746 44 L.Ed. 701; State Board of Assessors v. Comptoir National D'Escompte de Paris, \n191 \nU.S. 388\n, 24 S.Ct. 109; Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 \nU.S. 395\n, 27 S.Ct. 499; Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 203\n, at pages 212, 213, 56 S.Ct. 773, 778. But it is equally applicable to shares of corporate stock which, because of their use in a business of the owner, may be treated as localized, for purposes of taxation, at the place of the business, see First National Bank v. Maine, supra, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 331\n, 52 S. Ct. 174, 178, 77 A.L.R. 1401; cf. De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 382\n, 39 S.Ct. 524. Appellant's entire business in Minnesota is founded on its ownership of the shares of stock and their use as instruments of corporate control. They are as much 'integral parts' of the local business as accounts receivable in a merchandising business, or the bank accounts in which the proceeds of the accounts receivable are deposited upon collection. Compare Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 203\n, 212-214, 56 S.Ct. 773, 778. Thus identified with the business conducted by appellant in Minnesota, they are as subject to local property taxes as they would be if the owner were a private individual domiciled in the state.\n Appellant does not deny that it is subject to taxation in Minnesota on some intangibles. In making its 1934 return of 'moneys and credits' for taxation under Minn.Stat.1927 (Mason)  2337 et seq., which imposes the present tax, appellant included bank deposits within and without the state, promissory notes, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness. It does not challenge the tax imposed on its shares of stock in corporations organized and doing business without the state, other than those in the Montana and North Dakota banks. It says that \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n these states have adopted the only feasible scheme of taxation of the shares of state banks which will admit of a state property tax on national bank shares, since R.S.  5219, as amended (12 U.S.C.  548 (12 U.S.C.A.  548)), permits shares of national banks to be taxed only by the state where the bank does business, and then only if they are not assessed 'at a greater rate than ... other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens ... coming into competition with the business of national banks.' See First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 348\n, 46 S.Ct. 135, 138; State of Minnesota v. First National Bank, \n273 \nU.S. 561\n, 47 S.Ct. 468. Both states assess for property taxation the shares of national banks doing business within their limits and assess in like manner the shares of state banks, and thus avoid discrimination in taxation between the shares of national and of state banks.\n Appellant argues that every state may establish a tax situs within the state for shares of stock in its own banking corporations, and that Montana and North Dakota have done so by providing, in pursuance of their scheme for the local taxation of banking corporations, that the shares shall be taxable there. Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466\n, 25 S.Ct. 297; see First National Bank of Louisville v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353; Tappan v. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall. 490; Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69, 81\n, 46 S.Ct. 256, 258, 43 A.L.R. 1374. It insists that as the shares are properly taxable by the respective states of their origin, and as due process forbids the imposition of a property tax upon intangibles in more than one state, they cannot be taxed in Minnesota.\n The logic is inexorable if the premises are accepted. But we do not find it necessary to decide whether taxation of the shares in Montana or North Dakota is foreclosed by sustaining the Minnesota tax. Nor need we inquire whether a nonresident shareholder, by acquiring \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n stock in a local corporation, so far subjects his investment to the control and laws of the state which has created the corporation as to preclude any objection, on grounds of due process, to the taxation of the shares there, even though they are subject to taxation elsewhere, at their business situs. \n1\n We leave those questions open. It is enough for present purposes that this Court has often upheld and never denied the constitutional power to tax shares of stock at the place of the domicil of the owner. Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 34 S.Ct. 201, Ann.Cas.1916C, 842; Klein v. Board of Tax Supervisors, \n282 \nU.S. 19, 24\n, 51 S.Ct. 15, 16, 73 A.L.R. 679; Wright v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n195 \nU.S. 219\n, 25 S.Ct. 16; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390\n, 33 S.Ct. 120. And it has fully recognized that the business situs of an intangible affords an adequate basis for fixing a place of taxation. See Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, supra; De Ganay v. Lederer, supra; cf. Safe Deposit & T. Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 91\n, 50 S.Ct. 59, 60, 67 A.L.R. 386.\n The rule that property is subject to taxation at its situs, within the territorial jurisdiction of the taxing state, readily understood and applied with respect to tangibles, is in itself meaningless when applied to intangibles which, since they are without physical characteristics, can have no location in space. See Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 203\n, at page 209, 56 S.Ct. 773, 776. The resort to a fiction by the attribution of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n a tax situs to an intangible is only a means of symbolizing, without fully revealing, those considerations which are persuasive grounds for deciding that a particular place is appropriate for the imposition of the tax. Mobilia sequuntur personam, which has won unqualified acceptance when applied to the taxation of intangibles, Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 48 S.Ct. 410, 413, states a rule without disclosing the reasons for it. But we have recently had occasion to point out that enjoyment by the resident of a state of the protection of its laws is inseparable from responsibility for sharing the costs of its government, and that a tax measured by the value of rights protected is but an equitable method of distributing the burdens of government among those who are privileged to enjoy its benefits. See People of the State of New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, decided March 1, 1937\n\n\n The economic advantages realized through the protection, at the place of domicil, of the ownership of rights in intangibles, the value of which is made the measure of the tax, bear a direct relationship to the distribution of burdens which the tax effects. These considerations support the taxation of intangibles at the place of domicil, at least where they are not shown to have acquired a business situs elsewhere, as a proper exercise of the power of government. Like considerations support their taxation at their business situs, for it is there that the owner in every practical sense invokes and enjoys the protection of the laws, and in consequence realizes the economic advantages of his ownership. We cannot say that there is any want of due process in the taxation of the corporate shares in Minnesota, irrespective of the extent of the control over them which the due process clause may save to the states of incorporation.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Corry v.

BEACH(1937)\nNo. 621\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. Arthur B. Weiss, of Bridgeport, Conn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Sydney P. Simons, of Bridgeport, Conn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether respondent, who has filed a petition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended (11 U.S.C.  203 (11 U.S.C.A. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n s 203)) for the composition or extension of his debts, is a farmer as there defined.\n The facts are stipulated as follows: Beach was the owner of a farm with five houses and a barn on it where he had lived from his birth, occupying one of the houses with his wife and children as his homestead. The farm had been in the ownership of his family for two centuries and over. For a time he had been engaged in mercantile pursuits, but in 1930, owing to heavy financial losses, he began working on the farm again, and has given most of his time to it ever since. The land had an apple orchard of 200 trees which gave him 1,500 bushels of choice apples in 1931. He got little out of the orchard from 1933 to 1935, the trees during those years being affected by a blight. He sold pears from a few pear trees, and cultivated a large garden of about one acre, planting and raising all kinds of vegetables, fruits, and flowers, more than enough to provide for his family. He raised hay and sold it, repaired the houses, cleaned out one of the wells, laid several miles of stone walls and two miles of barbed wire fence, carted stone from time to time to enable him to rebuild his fences, and raised and sold potatoes. He was occupied principally in raising poultry and eggs, having 200 chickens in 1933, and about 50 from 1935 to the time of the trial. He kept three sheep for food; one horse for carting and hauling; and a miscellaneous assortment of farm tools, none purchased since 1921. His total income per annum from 1930 to 1935 was $4, 000 of which $2,200 was derived from renting three-quarters of the farm to various persons for grazing and cultivation. One of these tenants conducted a dairy, and bred, grazed and milked a herd of cows. The earnings from the sale of poultry and eggs were $200, from the sale of hay $ 75, and $25 from the sale of vegetables and flowers. Rentals from other real estate, not claimed to be farm property, made up the remainder of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n his income, $1,500. The farm in its entirety was subject to a mortgage of $ 100,000, held by a bank, and now under foreclosure.\n When section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act was adopted in March, 1933, subsection (r) defined a farmer as follows: 'For the purpose of this section and section 74, the term 'farmer' means any individual who is personally bona fide engaged primarily in farming operations or the principal part of whose income is derived from farming operations, and includes the personal representative of a deceased farmer; and a farmer shall be deemed a resident of any county in which such farming operations occur.' Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467, 1470, 1473, 11 U.S.C .  203(r).\n The definition was amplified on May 15, 1935, by the following amendment: 'For the purposes of this section, section 4(b), and section 74 ( section 22(b), and section 202), the term 'farmer' includes not only an individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in producing products of the soil, but also any individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in dairy farming, the production of poultry or livestock, or the production of poultry products or livestock products in their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of whose income is derived from any one or more of the foregoing operations, and includes the personal representative of a deceased farmer; and a farmer shall be deemed a resident of any county in which such operations occur.' Act of May 15, 1935, c. 114,  3, 49 Stat. 246, 11 U.S.C.  203(r) (11 U.S.C.A.  203(r).\n A petition for relief under the section as thus amended was filed by the debtor on November 14, 1935, and was opposed by the mortgagee, the petitioner here. The District Court held that the debtor was not a farmer within the meaning of the statute, and so dismissed the proceeding. An appeal was allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which reversed the judgment of dis- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n missal, one judge dissenting. In re Beach, 86 F.(2d) 88. The reversal went upon the ground that the principal income of the debtor was derived from farming operations, if rents from the farm tenants ($2,200) were included in the reckoning, as the court held that they should be. We granted certiorari (\n300 \nU.S. 650\n, 57 S.Ct. 513, 81 L.Ed. --), an important question being involved as to the meaning of an act of Congress.\n The only effect of the 1935 amendments of the statute, in so far as they have to do with the definition of a farmer was do make it clear that farming operations include dairy farming and the production of poultry and livestock products in their unmanufactured state as well as the cultivation of the products of the soil. There had been decisions to the contrary. In re Palma Bros. (D.C.) 8 F.Supp. 920; In re Stubbs (D.C.) 281 F. 568; House Report, No. 455, 74th Congress, 1st session, p. 2; Senate Report, No. 498, 74th Congress, 1st session, p. 4. For the purpose of the case at hand the amendments may be laid aside and the simpler phraseology of the section as it stood at the beginning may be accepted as the test. Was respondent a farmer because 'personally bona fide engaged primarily in farming operations' or because 'the principal part of his income was derived from farming operations'?\n We do not try to fix the meaning of either of the two branches of this definition, considered in the abstract. The two are not equivalents. They were used by way of contrast. Occasions must have been in view when the receipt of income derived from farming operations would make a farmer out of some one who personally or primarily was engaged in different activities. A catalogue of such occasions might err for excess or for defect if made up in advance. Hypothetical situations are laid before us, and the argument is pressed that the definition will breed absurdity if applied to this one of them or that. We refuse to be led away from the limitations of the concrete case. The words 'primarily engaged,' as we find \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n them in the first branch of the definition, do not constitute a term of art. The words 'income derived from farming operations' do not constitute such a term. In every case the totality of the facts is to be considered and appraised. We pass to that appraisal here.\n\n 1. \nBeach, the respondent, must be held, when the facts are viewed in combination, to have been 'personally' and 'primarily' engaged in farming operations.\n He was in that business or in none. He was either a farmer or a man of leisure. Cf. In re Glick (C.C.A.) 26 F.(2d) 398, 400. But the stipulation makes it clear that this last he certainly was not. He was in direct or personal possession of forty-eight acres, one-fourth of the large farm which had been in his family for years. A substantial part of this acreage he cultivated with his own labor, or applied, again with his own labor, to other agricultural uses. He did this, not for diversion or only in spare hours, but as an engrossing occupation, consuming in the words of the stipulation, 'the major portion of his time.' The products of his toil were good for him and his dependents, and the farmhouse was a home. True, the money returns were scanty. To some extent this was so because of the blight which fell upon his apple orchard in 1932 or later, cutting down the revenues yielded from that source. The scantiness of the yield may have turned him into a bankrupt, but it did not change his occupation. One does not cease to be a farmer because drought or wind or pest may have rendered the farm barren. The critical fact is that the debtor worked an acreage large enough to count, that he did not work at anything else, and that he gave to this work, whether profitable or unprofitable, 'the major portion of his time.'\n\n 2. \nIf Beach was a farmer because he cultivated a substantial farm, he did not step into another business by leasing other acres of the tract to tenants who were to use what they hired for grazing or cultivation and other \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n farming operations. We shall point out in a moment that the acres personally cultivated and those occupied by tenants are phases and aspects of a unitary calling. The result will be the same, however, though the farming and the leasing be viewed as disconnected, and not as parts of a composite whole. In that view, the farming is still the business; the leases are then investments, more profitable than the business, but leaving it unchanged. A farmer remains a farmer, just as a lawyer remains a lawyer, though the returns of his investments, while not enough to keep him going, are larger, none the less, than the profits of his labor.\n\n 3. \nThe picture, however, is distorted if Beach is looked upon as a landlord with rentals unrelated to his primary vocation. His rentals like his labor smacked of the soil, and made him not less, but more a farmer than he would have been without them. How the case would stand if he had been a merchant or a doctor and had leased a tract of farming land to tenants, we do not have to say. What has happened here is different. The farming and the leasing must be viewed in combination if we are to gain a true perspective, the two tied together as principal and incident. A single tract of land belonging to the debtor has been worked by him in part, and in part worked by others to whom a section of the tract has been let for cultivation. Far from stepping into another business, he has been faithful to the old one in thus dividing up the tillage. To get a living out of the land in one way or another is the thread of common purpose that binds the labor and the leases, and enables us to find in them the tokens of the same vocation. In brief the man is seen to be a farmer by every test of common speech, though his income has been garnered in rents as well as products. We emphasize the fact afresh that the words of the statute to which meaning is to be given are not phrases of art with a changeless connotation. They have a color and a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n content that may vary with the setting. Cf. Surace v. Danna, 248 N.Y. 18, 21, 161 N.E. 315; Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S.Ct. 158, L.R.A.1918D, 254; International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S.Ct. 19. In the setting of this enterprise, the totality of its circumstances, the roots of the respondent's income go down into the soil.\n\n 4. \nCases in other courts relied upon by the petitioner as excluding the respondent from the category of farmers are consistent for the most part with the ruling now made when the opinions are read with due relation to the facts.\n Either the debtor posing as a farmer was engaged at the same time in some other line of business or the plots in cultivation were too small to make a farm.

Schweinhaut, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The case comes here on certified questions. 28 U.S.C.  346 (28 U.S.C. A.  346).\n Appellant was indicted for violation of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, 41 Stat. 324, 18 U.S.C.  408 (18 U.S.C.A.  408). He was convicted, sentenced, and on July 1, 1936, in due time, took an appeal. On July 20, 1936, he filed an assignment of errors and a designation of record. On that date, he also submitted a bill of exceptions by filing it, not signed by the trial judge, with the clerk of the court. At the same time, he gave notice of that filing to the United States Attorney stating that he would submit the bill of exceptions for settlement. Prior to July 31, 1936, the bill of exceptions was 'agreed upon' by the United States Attorney and appellant's counsel. On July 31, 1936, the trial judge was on vacation outside the District and was not to return until September. He signed the bill of exceptions on September 2, 1936. Below his signature appeared the statement, 'The foregoing bill of exceptions is satisfactory to the Government and the defendant,' signed by the attorneys for both parties. There was no extension of time for the settlement of the bill of exceptions which, together with the assignment of errors, was transmitted to the clerk of the Court of Appeals on September 9, 1936. Argument was had in due course, and on April 5, 1937, the Court of Appeals (68 App.D.C. 111, 94 F.2d 236) decided that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed. The errors assigned and argued on the appeal involved solely the sufficiency of the evidence as shown by the bill of exceptions.\n The Court of Appeals granted a motion by the government to stay the mandate and also a motion for rehearing 'limited to the legal effect of the settlement of the bill of exceptions on September 2, 1936, the appeal having been perfected on July 1, 1936.' The government moved that the bill of exceptions be stricken and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n the judgment of the District Court be affirmed. The Court of Appeals has certified the following questions:\n'1. When, in a criminal case, a bill of exceptions has, within thirty days after the taking of an appeal, been prepared, agreed to by counsel for the United States and the appellant, and 'submitted' by filing the same with the clerk of the District Court, but when the trial judge does not settle and sign the bill within said thirty days, but does settle and sign the same thereafter, is the bill of exceptions properly settled and signed?\n\n'If question No. 1 is answered in the negative, then:\n\n'2. When, in a criminal case, a bill of exceptions not settled and signed by the trial judge within proper time, but nevertheless actually settled and signed by said judge, is transmitted by the clerk of the District Court to the clerk of the Court of Appeals, together with the assignment of errors and other pertinent papers, and when the Court of Appeals hears the appeal upon errors assigned and argued involving solely the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty, and adjudges that the judgment of the District Court be reversed, and when throughout the appeal the United States raises no question as to the validity of the bill of exceptions and when question as to the validity of the bill of exceptions is for the first time raised upon petition for rehearing by the United States, and when on rehearing granted motion is made by the United States to strike the bill of exceptions, must the bill of exceptions be stricken?\n\n'If question No. 2 is answered in the affirmative, then\n\n'3. When, in a criminal case, the validity of the bill of exceptions is for the first time raised on petition for rehearing by the United States after the case has been heard and reversed on appeal upon errors involving solely the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty, and when the Court of Appeals on rehearing granted and motion to strike has stricken the bill of exceptions as not \n\n[302 \nU.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n settled and signed within proper time, is it within the power of the Court of Appeals then to make an order extending the time for settlement and signing of the bill of exceptions by the trial judge in order that the case may be heard anew upon the merits?'\n\n The bill of exceptions was not settled and filed in time. Rule 9, Criminal Appeals Rules (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). The fact that the trial judge was absent from the District was not an excuse. The Criminal Appeals Rules provide in that case for settlement by any other judge assigned to hold, or holding, the court in which the case was tried. Rule 13 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). But although the bill of exceptions was not settled and filed in time, the Court of Appeals, from the time of the filing of the duplicate notice of appeal, had complete supervision and control of the proceedings on the appeal, including the proceedings relating to the preparation of the record on appeal. Rule 4 ( 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a).\n Under the comprehensive provisions of Rule 4, the Court of Appeals may vacate or modify any order made by the trial judge in relation to the prosecution of the appeal, and this authority extends to any order fixing the time for the settlement and filing of a bill of exceptions. Ray v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 158, 163\n, 164 S., 57 S.Ct. 700, 703. The Court of Appeals may extend the time or shorten the time. Through its supervision and control it may correct any miscarriage of justice in respect to the settlement of the bill of exceptions. Neither party is remediless when such corrective action is required. To that end, and in order to give a desirable flexibility, the rules do not attempt to lay down specific requirements to meet various situations, but place upon the Court of Appeals full responsibility for the exercise of a reasonable control over all the proceedings relating to the appeal. Ray v. United States, supra.\n In this instance, had the question been raised in limine, the Court of Appeals would have had power to deter \n\n[302 \nU.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n mine what the interests of justice required and it lost none of that power by reason of the fact that the question was not brought to its attention until the court had heard argument and reached a decision upon the assumption that the bill of exceptions was properly before it. As no question appears to have been raised as to the propriety or sufficiency of the bill of exceptions, apart from the time of settlement and filing, it would be a mere idle form to extend the time and return the bill of exceptions for resettlement accordingly, which the Court of Appeals has power to do, and thus to have the same bill of exceptions again presented and the case heard anew upon the merits, and the court may, in its sound discretion, refuse to strike the bill of exceptions and approve the settlement and filing heretofore had.\n Question No. 1 is answered 'No.' Question No. 2 is answered 'No.' Question No. 3 is not answered.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOUNDERS GENERAL CORPORATION V.

Leach & Co., Inc.\n\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  These three cases present, in the main, the same question: When, at the instance of one entitled to receive stock, the certificates therefor are, at his request and for his convenience, issued by the corporation in the name of a nominee who receives no beneficial interest therein, does the transaction involve a transfer by the beneficial owner requiring a documentary stamp pursuant to section 800, Schedule A(3) of the Revenue Act of 1926, February 26, 1926, c. 27, Title 8, 44 Stat. 99, 101?\n  The taxpayers seek to recover the amounts alleged to have been wrongfully exacted for the tax, with interest and penalties. In No. 398, the claim of Founders Gen- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 270]\n\u00a0\n eral Corporation for $4,733.33 was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 290; 84 F.(2d) 976. In No. 331, the claim of A. B. Leach & Co., Inc., for $16,526.40 was allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 84 F.(2d) 908. In No. 330, the claim of Automatic Washer Company for $1,593.63 was allowed by the Court of Claims, 15 F.Supp. 70. Because of the conflict, we granted certiorari, \n299 \nU.S. 531\n; \n299 \nU.S. 534\n.\n  1. In the suit brought by the Founders Corporation, the complaint, setting forth the following facts, was dismissed: On September 10, 1929, that corporation agreed with the United States Electric Power Corporation to subscribe for 100,000 shares of its common stock, to be delivered on September 17th, each share to be accompanied by a warrant entitling the holder to subscribe before January 2, 1940, for an additional share. After making the agreement and before delivery of the shares, the Founders Corporation directed that the securities by issued in the name of Benton & Co., as its nominee. Benton & Co. was a partnership, organized in 1928 solely to hold in its name securities belonging to the plaintiff, and to transfer them at plaintiff's request. For acting as nominee, the partnership received from plaintiff an annual fee of $1,500. By contract between Benton & Co. and plaintiff, neither the partnership nor any member thereof could claim any beneficial interest in any securities held by the firm, and plaintiff was appointed agent of Benton & Co. for the sale and transfer of securities registered in the partnership name. The stock issued by the Electric Power Corporation in the name of Benton & Co. was delivered to the Founders Corporation.\n  Stamp taxes were confessedly payable on the original issue, and on the transfer of any securities from Benton & Co. to the public. The only tax challenged is that upon the alleged transfer by plaintiff to Benton & Co. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 271]\n\u00a0\n of the right to receive the stock of the Electric Power Corporation.\n  2. In the suit brought by A. B. Leach & Co., Inc., the declaration upon demurrer to which the recovery was had set forth the following facts: That concern, being engaged in the business of selling securities to the public, organized five corporations; subscribed for all their stock; and directed that the stock be issued in the name of Vercouter, an employee. It is conceded that he had no beneficial interest in the stock; had no authority to act except as directed by A. B. Leach & Co., Inc.; and received the certificates solely for its benefit and convenience in connection with future sales to the public.\n  Stamp taxes were confessedly payable on the original issue, by the five corporations. The only tax challenged is that upon the alleged transfer by the taxpayer to Vercouter of the right to receive the stock of the five corporations.\n  3. In the suit brought by Automatic Washer Company, the facts found on which recovery was allowed are these: An agreement, dated June 22, 1928, between Folds, Buck & Co., bankers, and Nelson, a stockholder and officer of the Washer Company's corporate predecessor, provided that Nelson proposed to cause the latter concern to be reorganized as a Delaware corporation which should acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of the old company; that the new company should issue therefor 140,000 shares of common and 40,000 shares of preferred; and that the bankers should have the option of acquiring for $1,000,000 40,000 shares of the common and 40, 000 shares of the preferred. On September 17, 1928, the stockholders of the old company agreed with Nelson to contribute ratably the shares in the new which were to be sold to the bankers. To this end, each irrevocably appointed Nelson and one Gallagher attorneys in fact to receive the stock of the new company and to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 272]\n\u00a0\n make sale thereof to the bankers. The new company, the taxpayer, was organized. On September 27, 1928, the two companies agreed that the assets should be transferred to the new in consideration of its issuing its common and preferred stock to the stockholders of the old. The agreement recited the arrangement with the bankers and that:\n'In order to carry out this plan * * * each of the stockholders of the Old Company has irrevocably constituted and appointed H. E. Nelson and W. N. Gallagher his attorneys in fact to receive the repective securities of the New Company to which such stockholder may be entitled and to make sale of that portion thereof to be contributed by such stockholder for the purpose of carrying out said agreement of sale with the Bankers. * * * Accordingly, the New Company * * * shall issue such certificates in such names and for such amounts as shall be specified in the joint order of the said H. E. Nelson and W. N. Gallagher, the attorneys in fact * * *, and deliver the same to said attorneys in fact. * * *'\n\n  The 74,538 shares designed to be sold to the bankers were issued to Nelson. 1 Of these, 13,173 were the pro rata contribution of Nelson.\n  The taxpayer concedes now that stamp taxes were payable on the original issue of all the stock by the new company; on the old company's transfer to its stockholders (including Nelson) of its right to receive the new company's stock; on Nelson's transfer to the bankers; and on the bankers' sales to the public. The government concedes now that taxes are not payable on Nelson's alleged transfer to himself of his 13,173 shares which were to go to the bankers. The tax challenged is \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 273]\n\u00a0\n that on the alleged transfer to Nelson of the right to receive the 61,365 shares which the other stockholders contributed.\n  The applicable part of section 800, Schedule A-Stamp Taxes, is as follows:\n'3. Capital stock, sales or transfers: On all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares of certificates of stock or of profits or of interest in property or accumulations in any corporation, or to rights to subscribe for or to receive such shares or certificates, whether made upon or shown by the books of the corporation, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer or sale, whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such stock, interest, or rights, or not, on each $100 of face value or fraction thereof, 2 cents, and where such shares are without par or face value, the tax shall be 2 cents on the transfer or sale or agreement to sell on each share; Provided, That it is not intended by this title to impose a tax upon an agreement evidencing a deposit of certificates as collateral security for money loaned thereon, which certificates are not actually sold, nor upon the delivery or transfer for such purpose of certificates so deposited, nor upon mere loans of stock nor upon the return of stock so loaned: Provided further, That the tax shall not be imposed upon deliveries or transfers to a broker for sale, nor upon deliveries or transfers by a broker to a customer for whom and upon whose order he has purchased same, but such deliveries or transfers shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the facts.'\n\n  First. In each case, the person originally entitled to receive the certificate directed, for his own convenience and purposes, that it be issued in the name of a nominee. It is argued in the Automatic Washer Company Case, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 274]\n\u00a0\n that the stockholders of the old company never acquired the 'right to receive' that portion of their stock which was designed for transfer to the bankers; that they did not become entitled to receive shares in the new company until the contract with it was made on September 27th; that prior thereto, they had irrevocably agreed that Nelson should receive and sell the shares which were to go to the bankers; and that, thus, the stockholders of the old company had, prior to the original issue of the stock in the new, relinquished 'the power to command the disposition of the shares' and, therefore, never exercised that power, held taxable in Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 60, 102\n A.L.R. 111. But essentially the same argument was made and rejected in the Raybestos Case, \n296 \nU.S. 60\n, at page 62, 64, 102 A.L.R. 111. There the transaction was held to have involved a taxable transfer of rights to stock, though the old companies had no right to the stock in the consolidated company prior to the execution of the contract whereby the issue to their stockholders was directed. 'The reach of a taxing act whose purpose is as obvious as the present is not to be restricted by technical refinements.' Id., \n296 \nU.S. 60, 63\n, 65, 102 A.L.R. 111. Compare Helvering v. Midland Mutual Life Insurance Co., \n300 \nU.S. 216\n. The situation here is in substance the same as in the Raybestos Case. When the powers of attorney were executed, there was nothing upon which they could operate. The rights to receive the stock in the new company, and the transfer thereof, were effected at one time by the same document.\n  Second. It is true that in none of the three cases did the transaction involve the transfer of a beneficial interest. But that fact is, in view of the language of the act, without legal significance. The tax is exacted because the taxpayer transferred 'the right to receive' the certificate. Likewise it is without legal significance that, under power of attorney from nominee to beneficial owner, the former may have no part in the management or disposal of the securities. Nor is it material that in no case did the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 268\n, 275]\n\u00a0\n nominee have a right, at least as against the taxpayer, to compel issuance of the stock to himself. The legal title to the shares was received by the nominee from the newly formed corporation; but the authorization rendering his holding lawful was received from the taxpayer. The legality of the issuance of the stock in the names of the nominees rests on the fact that the taxpayers authorized such issuance and granted their nominees the right to receive the stocks entered in their names. The grant of that authority is a transfer of 'the right to receive' within the meaning of the act; and we are not to look beyond the act for further criteria of taxability. See Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 77.\n  The statute defines the scope of the tax in terms whose breadth is emphasized by the careful particularity of its provisos. Especially indicative of Congressional intention that nominee transactions generally should be subject to the tax are the provisos added by the Revenue Act of 1932, June 6, 1932, c. 209,  723, 47 Stat. 273 (26 \nU.S.C.A.  902 note), and the Act of June 29, 1936, c. 865, 49 Stat. 2029 (26 \nU.S.C.A.  902(b), 921(b) 1 note), which except certain specifically described transfers to nominees.\n  Third. It is suggested that in each case the taxpayer might have attained his ultimate purpose by a form of transaction which would not have subjected him to the tax. The suggestion, if true, furnishes no reason for relieving him of tax when, for whatever reason, he chooses a mode of dealing within the terms of the act. Compare United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 506; Provost v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 443, 457\n, 458, 155. To make the taxability of the transaction depend upon the determination whether there existed an alternative form which the statute did not tax would create burden and uncertainty. 'There must be a fixed and indisputable mode of ascertaining a stamp tax.' People of State of New York ex rel. Hatch, v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 159\n, 190, 9 Ann.Cas. 736.\n  In No. 398, judgment affirmed.\n  In No. 331, judgment reversed.\n  In No. 330, judgment reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied United States v.

Harris J. Griston and Louis Karasik, both of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner pleaded guilty to three indictments in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Inch, a District Judge of the Eastern District of New York, who had been designated and assigned to suit in the Southern District, pursuant to Rev.St.  591, as amended,1 received the pleas and imposed a sentence under the first indictment (No. C 96-116) of two years' imprisonment and $1,000 fine. Under the other indictments he made identical orders: 'Imposition of sentence suspended. Probation for four years to begin after serving sentence on C 96-116. Subject to the standing probation orders of this Court.' The petitioner paid his fine and served his sentence and thereupon entered upon his period of probation.\n Twenty months after Judge Inch had returned to his own district, application was made to him at chambers, to discharge the petitioner from probation and to terminate the proceedings against him, pursuant to section 2 of the Probation Act of March 4, 1925, amended by Act June 16, 1933.2 The judge directed that notice of the application be given to the probation officer of the Southern District of New York. This was done and, after a hearing on the merits in the Eastern District, at which the probation officer was present and took part, Judge Inch entered an order revoking the probation, discharging the petitioner from further supervision and terminating the proceedings against him. The order was captioned in the 'United States District Court for the Southern District of New York' and was filed in the office of the clerk of that court. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n About a year later, on a petition by the probation officer of the Southern District, a judge sitting in that district authorized a warrant for the petitioner's apprehension upon a charge of violation of the terms of his probation. The petitioner was arrested and admitted to bail pending a hearing.\n Thereafter the United States attorney for the Southern District moved to vacate the order of Judge Inch terminating the probation and the proceedings. By stipulation of counsel, Judge Inch returned to the Southern District to hear the parties upon this motion but he entered no order since, meantime, the petitioner had surrendered himself to the marshal and sought a writ of habeas corpus, and the United States attorney had moved before a judge sitting in the Southern District that the petitioner be sentenced on the two indictments under which sentence had been suspended. \n3\n The petition for the writ and the motion for sentence were heard together; the petition was granted, and the motion was denied. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the cause 'for the consideration of the revocation of (the petitioner's) probation and for sentence if warranted.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n We granted the writ of certiorari, \n301 \nU.S. 681\n, 57 S.Ct. 946, because of the importance of the questions presented in the administration of the Probation Act. We hold that the judgment of the court below was right.\n First. The contention that the trial court was without power to suspend the imposition of sentences on the pleas of guilty to two of the indictments and place the de- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n fendant on probation effective after completion of service of sentence on the third indictment is without merit. Based upon this contention the petitioner says that when he had completed service of the sentence imposed on indictment C 96-116 there remained no sentence against him and the term having long since expired the court was without power then to impose one.\n The Probation Act (supra) provides, in section 1 (18 U.S.C.A.  724), that United States courts having original jurisdiction of criminal actions, being satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public and of the defendant will be served thereby, shall have power, after conviction for any crime or offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment, 'to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and to place the defendant upon probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as they may deem best,' or to impose a fine and place the defendant upon probation; to revoke or modify any condition of probation or change the period thereof, provided that the period with any extensions shall not exceed five years. The act was intended to cure the lack of power indefinitely to suspend a sentence, under which District Courts labored prior to the enactment. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The second section, as amended (18 U.S.C.A.  725) provides that at any time within the probation period, or at any time after the probation period but within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced, the probationer may be summoned before the court and 'the court may revoke the probation or the suspension of sentence, and may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed.' The action of the trial court in suspending sentence and imposing probation on two of the indictments was in strict accordance with the authority thus explicitly conferred. The validity of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n cited provisions is not open to question. \n6\n The mere fact that a sentence of a fine and imprisonment had been imposed upon one of the indictments in no way militated against the prescription of probation in respect of the plea of guilty under the other two.7\n Second. The order of Judge Inch, sitting in the Eastern District, after the termination of his service in the Southern District, was null. The statute providing for designation and assignment of a District Judge to sit temporarily in another district than his own does not authorize the order, and the express provisions and obvious intent of the Probation Act negate the power of any judge, other than a judge of the Southern District of New York, to make it.\n The Act of March 3, 1911,  18, as amended,8 provides: 'Any designated and assigned judge who has held court in another district than his own shall have power, notwithstanding his absence from such district and the expiration of the time limit in his designation, to decide all matters which have been submitted to him within such district, to decide motions for new trials, settle bills of exceptions, certify or authenticate narratives of testimony, or perform any other act required by law or the rules to be performed in order to prepare any case so tried by him for review in an appellate court.'\n When an assigned judge has presided at the trial of a cause, he is to have power, though the period of his service has expired, and though he may have returned to his own district, to perform the functions which are incidental and supplementary to the duties performed by him while present and acting in the designated district. And where a cause has been submitted to him in the designated district, after his return to his own district he may enter decrees or orders and file opinions necessary to dispose of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n the case, notwithstanding the termination of his period of service in the foreign district. But the act goes not farther. It clearly does not contemplate that he shall decide any matter which has not been submitted to him within the designated district. A criminal trial is concluded by the judgment of sentence entered upon a plea or a verdict of guilt. By express provision of the statute an assigned judge may thereafter, notwithstanding the expiration of his term of service, hear a motion for a new trial and do all things necessary to prepare a record for an appellate court but no authority is given to hear a new matter even though that new matter may arise in the same case. An application for the termination of the probation and the proceedings against a defendant constitutes a new matter, submission of which may not be made to the assigned judge after his return to his own district. The appropriate place for its presentation is the court in which the judgment of conviction and the sentence is recorded. In the absence of express authorization no power to deal with such an application is vested in any other court.\n All the relevant provisions of the Probation Act refer to the court in which the guilt of the defendant was determined and sentence imposed. The first section (18 U.S.C.A.  724) empowers the court having jurisdiction of the action to place the defendant upon probation, and to revoke or modify the conditions of the probation. The second requires the probation officer, when directed by the court, to report to the court as to the conduct of the probationer; authorizes the court either to discharge the probationer from further supervision or to terminate the proceedings against him or to extend the period of probation, to issue a warrant, upon a proper showing, for the probationer's arrest and, upon a hearing, to revoke the probation or the suspension of sentence and to impose a sentence which might have originally been imposed. Section 3, as amended by Act June 6, 1930 (18 U.S.C.A.  726) au- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 318]\n\u00a0\n thorizes the judge of any United States court to appoint one or more suitable persons as probation officers 'within the jurisdiction and under the discretion of the judge making such appointment or of his successor.' Section 4, as amended by Act June 6, 1930 (18 U.S.C.A.  727), places upon a probation officer the duty to investigate any case referred to him for investigation by the court in which he is serving and to report thereon to the court, and such other duties as the court may direct.\n Thus the trial court has complete supervision over the probationer for the period of his probation and for the term of the maximum sentence which might have been imposed. This jurisdiction is vested in the trial court and in no other. To hold that a judge of another district, merely because he had temporarily sat at the trial and conviction of a defendant and imposed sentence, could, from that other district supervise, extend, modify or terminate the probation, would be to ignore the intent of the law. It would moreover result in confusion and inconvenience in the administration of the Probation Act. It would mean that the United States attorney and his assistants, and a probation officer of the court in which the judgment is recorded, would be required to go to distant parts to be heard upon the merits of any application by the probationer and that the probationer, at his will, could institute proceedings either before a judge of the court in which his conviction is recorded or the judge in a different district who had been a temporary member of that court. Such a possibility was certainly never intended. Probation is a system of tutelage under the supervision and control of the court which has jurisdiction over the convicted defendant, has the record of his conviction and sentence, the records and reports as to his compliance with the conditions of his probation, and the aid of the local probation officer, under whose supervision the defendant is placed. This jurisdiction is not divided between that court and a distant judge who sat by designation at the defendant's trial. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 312, 319]\n\u00a0\n Third. What has been said indicates the answer to petitioner's argument that the probation officer of the Southern District, by appearing before Judge Inch in the Eastern District upon the application for termination of the proceedings, and the United States attorney, by stipulating that Judge Inch might return to the Southern District to hear a motion for resettlement of his order, have waived venue or are estopped to question it. Neither of these officers could confer jurisdiction upon a designated judge to perform acts not authorized by the assignment act outside the district of designation after his term of service had ended. They could not waive the jurisdictional requirements of the Probation Act or by their conduct confer jurisdiction on a judge of another district to act for the trial court in which alone the statute vests the power to deal with the subject.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S.Code, Title 28,  17 (28 U.S.C.A.  17). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S.Code, Title 18,  725 (18 U.S.C.A.  725). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In fact there were two motions.

Also that when closed the Trust Company had in its assets $49,590.17 received under this agreement, and its correspondent banks had on hand deposits likewise acquired amounting to $32,403.26.\n  The bill prayed for a decree declaring petitioner owner of the $32, 403.26 and that a trust existed in its favor in respect of the $49,590.17 deposit; also for general relief.

GROSJEAN(1937)\nNo. 652\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 413]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., Robert L. Wright, of Chicago, Ill., and J. Blane Monroe, of New Orleans, La., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Leland Richardson, of Baton Rouge, La., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause presents the questions whether the method prescribed by a chain store tax act for ascertaining the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n rate of taxation offends the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause ( article 1,  8, cl. 3) of the Federal Constitution.\n In 1932 the legislature of Louisiana adopted an act levying an occupation or license tax upon chain stores,1 under which the exaction was fifteen dollars upon each of two or more stores, not in excess of five; upon each store in excess of five, but not exceeding ten, $25; and the amount increased in brackets for additional stores, the last bracket embracing stores in excess of fifty upon each of which the tax was $200.\n By Act No. 51 of 19342 the earlier law was amended to lay the tax on 'persons, firms, partnerships, corporations or associations of persons engaged in the business of operating two or more stores or mercantile establishments, one or more of which is located in this State, ... under the same general management, supervision, ownership or control.' Section 1. Section 3 provides that the tax 'shall be based on the number of stores or mercantile establishments included under the same general management, supervision, ownership or control, whether operated in this State or not, and shall be fixed and graded as follows, to-wit: (1) Upon stores or mercantile establishments operated in this State and belonging to a chain or group having a total of not more than ten stores, the annual license shall be Ten ($10.00) Dollars for each such store operated in this State.' There are fifteen additional paragraphs progressively increasing the rate per store in Louisiana of larger chains, the last fixing the rate for a store belonging to a chain of more than five hundred at $550.\n The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, an Arizona corporation, owning, operating or controlling 15,082 stores in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, 106 of which are in Louisiana, filed its bill in the District \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n Court to restrain the appellees, state officers, from enforcing the statute. Other corporations operating chains, some units of which are located in Louisiana, intervened as plaintiffs. A temporary restraining order issued, the appellees answered the bill, and the case was heard upon pleadings and proofs by a specially constituted court of three judges, which upheld the statute and dismissed the bill. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The constitutional infirmity of the act is said to consist in arbitrary discrimination in favor of local as against national chains, in the attempt to tax property and activities which are beyond the state's jurisdiction, and in burdening interstate commerce. We hold the legislation impregnable to attack on these grounds.\n First. The exaction is an occupation or license tax. The subject is the conduct of a business within Louisiana. Without contravening the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a state may separately classify for taxation the conduct of a chain store,4 and may increase the rate in proportion to the increase in the number of stores within the state, since the opportunities and powers of a chain store operator become greater with the growth of the number of units maintained. \n5\n The appellants assert that in adjusting the rate for a chain store in Louisiana the legislature may not take into account the size of the chain to which the store belongs, by counting the total number of its units wherever located. So to do, it is claimed, is arbitrarily to discriminate against sectional or national chains in favor of intrastate chains.\n The District Court found that the testimony offered by the State was similar to that in State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra; established the difference in type of opera- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n tion between the operator of one store and the operator of many, and the variance in advantage and mode of operation with the number of units in the chain. In addition, the court found that all the stores of a retail chain contribute to the central purchasing power of the chain irrespective of state lines and location of stores, and increase the per unit multiple advantage enjoyed by the operator of the system; that the greater the number of units the greater the purchasing power of the chain, the greater the rebates and allowances, the greater the advantages in advertising, the greater the capital employed, the greater the social and economic consequences, and the lower the cost of distribution and overhead. 'In fine, the record in this case shows the contribution to the advantages made by each unit in the chain, and the per unit advantage made possible by the whole system, and in that respect only does it differ materially from the proof which was before the court in the Jackson Case.' These findings are assigned as error, but they have substantial support in the record and we therefore accept them.\n If the competitive advantages of a chain increase with the number of its component links, it is hard to see how these advantages cease at the state boundary. Under the findings a store belonging to a chain of one hundred, all located in Louisiana, has not the same competitive advantages as one of one hundred Louisiana stores belonging to a national chain of one thousand. The appellants lean heavily on the findings of the court respecting the relative business in New Orleans of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Company and the H. G. Hill Stores, Inc., a Louisiana corporation. The court found that the operations of the two are generally of the same character; the former conducts one hundred and six stores in the state, sixty-two of which are in the city of New Orleans; the latter ninety-two in the state, of which eighty-seven are in the city. Each concern conducts grocery and meat stores with substan- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 421]\n\u00a0\n tially the same line of merchandise and their sales methods are practically the same. The gross volume of sales of Hill in New Orleans is much greater; it has more stores, and does more business per store in that city than the Atlantic & Pacific. The court further found, however, that the total purchasing power of the Atlantic & Pacific is much greater than that of Hill; that Atlantic & Pacific has field offices located at primary markets, which are in charge of specialists and supervised by central purchasing offices in New York, and maintains divisional warehouses throughout the country, whereas the operations of Hill are confined to Louisiana, and chiefly to New Orleans. Under the statute Hill is taxable at the rate of $30 per store as against $550 assessable against Atlantic & Pacific. These facts are said to demonstrate that the act denies the appellant and other intervenors the equal protection of the laws by arbitrarily discriminating against national in favor of local chains. But the contention is answered not only by the specific finding respecting the difference between the two companies' methods but by the general finding that addition of units to a chain increases the competitive advantage of each store in the chain.\n The court's findings are supported by evidence bearing upon a variety of advantages enjoyed by large chains which are unavailable to smaller chains. One striking illustration is furnished by the uncontradicted proof that the Atlantic & Pacific Company received, in the year 1934, from its vendors, secret rebates, allowances, and brokerage fees amounting to $8, 105,000 which were demanded by the company as a condition of purchasing from the vendors in question. The leverage which accomplished this was the enormous purchasing power of the company. The amount thus obtained equals $ 530 for each of the Atlantic & Pacific Company's stores or nearly the amount of the tax exacted by the statute. The \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 422]\n\u00a0\n appellants insist that these facts are not significant because there is testimony that, in the drug trade, quantity discounts usually do not increase after a certain volume of purchases is reached, but the testimony does not specify the point where quantity discounts cease to grow. The record discloses what would be plain enough without evidence, that generally volume of purchasing power spells lower prices, special terms, and other advantages. It is unnecessary to discuss the evidence supporting the findings with respect to other facilities enjoyed only, or in increased measure, by the larger chains.\n The appellants urge that the act arbitrarily discriminates in favor of local chains because it is inconceivable that a chain operating wholly within the state would have five hundred stores, not to mention upwards of fifteen thousand, the number maintained by the Atlantic & Pacific. The argument is inconsistent with the finding that additional units, wherever situate, increase the advantages and economic effects of the chain as a whole and of each unit; and ignores the possibility that a chain-store company of national scope might well be incorporated in Louisiana, whose stores in that state would be rated for taxation according to its total stores within and without the state.\n Other instances of the working of the act are cited to show that it arbitrarily discriminates against national chains and in favor of local ones solely because they are such. Thus, it is said, if a national chain owning 501 stores in other states, establishes a single store in a Louisiana city where there is a local chain of two or three like establishments, the national concern must pay a license of $550 for its one store while the stores of the local chain are taxed but $10 each. The appellees retort that since the earlier law imposed a tax of $15 on each store in the local chain and none upon the one Louisiana store of the national chain it was more vulnerable to the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 423]\n\u00a0\n charge of arbitrariness than the act under review. Whatever the pertinence of the reply, the facts found respecting the advantages of a larger chain as compared with a smaller justify as not unreasonable or arbitrary the imposition of a higher license tax on the units of the former which are maintained within the state. Even one unit of such a national chain located in Louisiana enjoys competitive advantages over the stores of the local proprietor consequent upon its relation to the farflung activities and facilities of the chain.\n The act under review is to be distinguished from the Florida statute considered in Liggett Co. v. Lee, supra, which increased the tax if the chain happened to have stores in two counties of the state rather than in one. The increase of rate was held arbitrary because it was unrelated to the size or character of the chain and was conditioned solely upon the location of one or more of its units. The Louisiana act adopts no such basis of classification. A small chain of three stores, one of which is in Louisiana and two in Mississippi, will pay exactly the same tax as a similar organization having the same number of stores all in Louisiana. A concern having ninety-two stores scattered over ten states, seven of which are in Louisiana, will pay exactly the same tax per Louisiana store as the H. G. Hill Stores, Inc., all of whose ninety-two stores are in Louisiana. Thus it appears that the classification is not based upon the location of the stores within or without the state but upon the type of business conducted, the scale of that business, its accompanying competitive advantages and economic results.\n Finally, since the court below found that the sales and earnings of the individual stores of a chain differ in various portions of the country and those of the Louisiana stores have been below the average for all stores of many of the appellants, the claim is that the statute, by taking into account all units indiscriminately in fixing the rate \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 424]\n\u00a0\n arbitrarily disregards the value of the local privilege for which the license fee is charged. We cannot say that classification of chains according to the number of units must be condemned because another method more nicely adjusted to represent the differences in earning power of the individual stores might have been chosen, for the legislature is not required to make meticulous adjustments in an effort to avoid incidental hardships. \n6\n It is enough that the classification has reasonable relation to the differences in the practices of small and large chains. The statute bears equally upon all who fall into the same class, and this satisfies the guaranty of equal protection. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The appellants contend the act deprives them of property without due process of law because the tax is imposed, at least in part, upon things which are beyond the jurisdiction of Louisiana. The state may not tax real property or tangible personal property lying outside her borders;8 nor may she lay an excise or privilege-tax upon the exercise or enjoyment of a right or privilege in another state derived from the laws of that state and therein exercised and enjoyed. \n9\n But, as we have seen, the subject of the tax in question is the prosecution of a defined business activity within the State of Louisiana-the conduct of a retail store which is a part of a chain under a single management, ownership or control-a legitimate subject of a license or occupation tax. The measure of the exaction is the number of units of the chain within the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 425]\n\u00a0\n state-a measure sanctioned by our decisions. The rate of tax for each such unit is fixed by reference to the size of the entire chain. In legal contemplation the state does not lay a tax upon property lying beyond her borders nor does she tax any privilege exercised and enjoyed by the taxpayer in other states. The law rates the privilege enjoyed in Louisiana according to the nature and extent of that privilege in the light of the advantages, the capacity, and the competitive ability of the chain's stores in Louisiana considered not by themselves, as if they constituted the whole organization, but in their setting as integral parts of a much larger organization. We cannot hold that this privilege is unaffected by the status of the Louisiana stores as members of such a chain or that recognition of the advantages and capacities enjoyed by them as a result of that membership is forbidden in classifying them for progressive increase of rate. Such classification is not in legal effect the taxation of property or privileges possessed or enjoyed by the taxpayer beyond the borders of the state.\n Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525\n, 40 S.Ct. 2, goes far to sustain the validity of the act. \n10\n The exaction in the present case is even less open to the accusation of extra-territoriality than the one there under consideration, because here it cannot be claimed, as it was there, that not alone the rate, but to some extent, the measure of the tax, is affected by the enjoyment of extra-state privileges.\n Our decision need not, however, rest on conceptions of subject, measure and rate of tax. Much broader considerations touching the state's internal policy of police sustain the exaction. The tax is laid solely upon intrastate commerce. \n11\n In the exercise of its police power \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 426]\n\u00a0\n the state may forbid, as inimical to the public welfare, the prosecution of a particular type of business,12 or regulate a business in such manner as to abate evils deemed to arise from its pursuit. \n13\n Whatever a state may forbid or regulate it may permit upon condition that a fee be paid in return for the privilege,14 and such a fee may be exacted to discourage the prosecution of a business or to adjust competitive or economic inequalities. \n15\n Taxation may be made the implement of the exercise of the state's police power;16 and proper and reasonable discrimination between classes to promote fair competitive conditions and to equalize economic advantages is therefore lawful. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n If, in the interest of the people of the state, the legislature deemed it necessary either to mitigate evils of com- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 427]\n\u00a0\n petition as between single stores and chains or to neutralize disadvantages of small chains in their competition with larger ones, or to discourage merchandising within the state by chains grown so large as to become a menace to the general welfare, it was at liberty to regulate the matter directly or to resort to the type of taxation evidenced by the Act of 1934 as a means of regulation. The appellants, by incorporating in some other state, or by spreading their business and activities over other states, cannot set at naught the public policy of Louisiana. The claim is, essentially, that even if local evils flow from the appellant's methods the state cannot control those evils because its power is limited to conditions created by the members of the chain found within the state. The conclusion is that the state must treat these stores as if they were something different from what they really are, since to do otherwise would be to reach beyond the borders of Louisiana for the measure of the tax. The argument answers itself. The policy Louisiana is free to adopt with respect to the business activities of her own citizens she may apply to the citizens of other states who conduct the same business within her borders, and this irrespective of whether the evils requiring regulation arise solely from operations in Louisiana or are in part the result of extrastate transactions. It is not a denial of due process to adjust such license taxes as are here involved to meet the local evil resulting from business practices and superior economic power even though those advantages and that power are largely due to the fact that the taxpayer does business not only in Louisiana but in other states.\n Third. Montgomery Ward & Company, one of the appellants, filed a bill of intervention. In addition to the objections already considered it contends that, as applied to its business, the act of 1934 constitutes an interference with and a regulation of interstate commerce forbidden by article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. The allegation is that \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 428]\n\u00a0\n this appellant owns and operates five stores in Louisiana and four hundred and eighty-six others spread over forty-five states; owns and operates nine mail order houses located in states other than Louisiana and nineteen so-called order stations located at various points outside Louisiana, the mail order houses and order stations all being exclusively engaged in interstate commerce. The order stations are installed in rented spaces with one regular employe at each and with a stock of samples, the only business transacted in them being the taking of orders which are transmitted to, and filled by, the mail order houses. With respect to the operation of the act the bill states: 'Intervenor alleges that while the present administrative interpretation of said Act No. 51 of the Louisiana legislature of 1934 apparently limits the operation of said act to the intervenor's retail stores, the words 'mercantile establishments' used in said Act apparently include the aforesaid mail order houses and order stations owned and operated by the intervenor. Said Act does not by its terms exclude from its operation said establishments engaged in interstate commerce and, therefore, violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.'\n The trial court found the facts as follows:\n'Montgomery, Ward & Company, an Illinois corporation, operates 9 mail order establishments engaged in filling orders received from points in the United States and foreign countries through the mail. None of these mail order establishments are situated in Louisiana. The Company also has 19 mail order offices, none of which are situated in Louisiana; 17 Class A department stores carrying a complete line of general merchandise, none of which are situated in Louisiana; 456 Class B retail stores of limited size and carrying a limited line of merchandise, of which 5 are located in Louisiana; and 16 Class C stores \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 429]\n\u00a0\n devoted exclusively to the sale of hardware, household appliances, automobile tires and tubes, of which none are located in Louisiana. The 5 Louisiana Class B stores take orders to be filled by mail from the Company's mail order establishment located at Fort Worth, in addition to selling merchandise at retail at its place of business to the public.'\n\n As a conclusion of law the court held: 'The claim (of the intervenor) does not merit serious consideration. The statute by its express terms applies only 'where goods, wares, merchandise or commodities of every description whatsoever are sold or offered for sale at retail.\"\n Error is assigned to the District Court's conclusion and the appellant insists that the statute is bad because it imposes a single and indivisible tax for the privilege of conducting a business both interstate and intrastate, partly measured by interstate operations wholly extrastate.\n As respects the regulation of interstate commerce the intervener's bill is premature and without equity. The statute was approved July 12, 1934, and became effective for the calendar year 1935 and subsequent years. February 27, 1935, both the bill of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and Montgomery Ward & Company's intervening bill were filed. The record discloses no rules or regulations promulgated by the appellee Supervisor of Public Accounts and no ruling by any responsible state official as to which of Montgomery Ward & Company's establishments are to be included in reckoning the total of its retail stores. For all that appears neither its mail order houses, nor its order stations, nor its department stores, will be included in the computation.\n It is manifest that Montgomery Ward & Company cannot upon mere supposition that the act will be unconstitutionally construed and applied in respect of its five stores in Louisiana obtain an advisory decree that the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 430]\n\u00a0\n act must not be so administered as to burden or regulate interstate commerce. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I are of opinion that the statute here involved is invalid as constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws and an attempted exertion of the legislative power of the state with respect to properties and businesses located beyond its territorial borders.\n In State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464, 75 A.L.R. 1536, this court sustained the validity of an Indiana statute imposing a chain-store tax graduated according to the number of stores under the same general management. But there, the amount of the tax in respect of each store was graduated according to the whole number of stores within the state. Here, the amount of the tax is not limited by the number of stores operated within the state, but is increased by including stores operated in other states and foreign countries. If, for example, the owner of a single store in Louisiana has fewer than ten stores outside the state, he pays a tax of $ 10; but if he operates as many as ten stores in other states or in Canada, he is required to pay upon his store in Louisiana $15 annually. And as the stores outside the state further increase in number, the tax upon the single store in Louisiana rises by successive steps until it reaches, in the highest bracket, where the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 431]\n\u00a0\n stores outside exceed 500 in number, the sum of $550 upon the single Louisiana store.\n We thought the classification in the Jackson Case, although confined to stores within the state, was so arbitrary as to render the tax invalid under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, together with Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, who takes no part in this case, set forth our views at length in a dissenting opinion. \n283 \nU.S. 543\n, 51 S. Ct. 545, et seq., 73 A.L.R. 1464, 75 A.L.R. 1536. We rest upon what was there said, without repeating it, not for the purpose of again challenging the decision in the Jackson Case, but because what we said applies more plainly to the variant facts of the case now under consideration. We thought then that the Jackson Case was wrongly decided, but, accepting it as authoritative, it seems to us certain that it goes to the extreme verge of the law, and, for the reasons given in our dissenting opinion, equally certain that the present decision goes far beyond the verge. We add a few words in support of that view.\n The Indiana law effected a discrimination between two classes-namely, operators of chain stores and operators of independent stores within the boundaries of the state, without reference to any stores outside. The Louisiana law effects a discrimination between two members of the same class-namely, chain-store operators within the state, where the only difference between them is that one also operates stores in other states and in Canada, while the other does not. Thus, for illustration, if A operates eleven stores in Louisiana, doing a business of $10,000,000 per year, and has none outside, he pays $15 for each store, or a total of $165, while if B operates eleven stores in Louisiana, and happens to have 490 stores distributed among the remaining 47 states of the Union and foreign countries, doing a total business of $5,000,000 per year, he is compelled to pay $550 upon \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 432]\n\u00a0\n each of his eleven stores, or a total of $6,050-36 times the amount of the tax paid by A. This enormous difference is based upon a state of affairs wholly external to the State of Louisiana, the effect of which upon the Louisiana business is a matter of bald conjecture, varying widely, as it must, with the localities in which the foreign stores are to be found and the local circumstances by which their operations are affected.\n Moreover, if the Louisiana statute be valid, other states in the Union may pass similar acts; and it is not improbable that they will. And if they do so, a remarkable situation will be brought about. Let us suppose, for example, that ten additional states, ranging from Maine to California, adopt the Louisiana form of legislation. In each of the states, including Louisiana, a given operator has ten stores, making 110 in all. In that case he will pay in each state a tax based not upon the operation of ten stores, but on the operation of 110. Instead, therefore, of paying in each state $100 upon the basis of $10 for each of the 10 stores, he will pay $500 upon the basis of $50 for each of the 10 stores. If he should then put into operation 16 additional stores, let us say in Canada or Norway, he would immediately bring himself into the bracket where the tax upon each store is fixed at $100-thus increasing his total taxation in the eleven states from $5,500 to $11,000, in virtue of these comparatively small operations in a foreign country, the effect of which, if any, in respect of competitive advantages in any one of the eleven states could hardly be described otherwise than as purely speculative.\n The exaction here involved is not a tax upon Louisiana property or business, but is essentially a penalty imposed upon an operator of business wholly beyond the reach of the law of that state. We are not able to concede that it lies within the province of one state to thus indirectly \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 433]\n\u00a0\n penalize a method of doing business in another state, which it may be the policy of the latter to permit or, indeed, encourage. Compare Baldwin v. G. A.F. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511\n, 521-524, 55 S.Ct. 497, 499, 500, 101 A.L.R. 55. The foregoing illustrations, and others which might be supplied, in our opinion expose the arbitrary character of the classification and the consequent invalidity of the exaction imposed in virtue of it.\n The sole fact that a Louisiana operator has opened additional stores in other states or in Canada or Norway, affords, we think, no valid basis for imposing upon him an enormously increased tax from which his competitors, similarly circumstanced in all other respects, are exempt. The claim that thereby the balance of competitive advantage has been disturbed, is so fanciful as to furnish no basis for such legislation grounded in any policy or object of state taxation. The court below thought that to consider the number of stores outside the state was competent for the purpose of determining the value of the privilege of operating each store within the state. But the fallacy of that view as applied to the present case is demonstrated by the facts as found by that court-namely, that operations of chain stores 'vary greatly from section to section and from state to state because of differences in local conditions, economic and otherwise, freight rates added to cost, remoteness from headquarters and executive management, increase in difficulty of supervision, local competition, and other factors. Conditions as to sales and profits vary greatly in all classes of stores according to the section of the country in which they are located.' An attempt to fix the extent of the competitive advantage which will inure in favor of a business in Louisiana or the value of the privilege of operating it upon a basis so shifting and uncertain, seems to us an utterly futile undertaking. It is nothing more than an effort to reach a conclusion upon an assumed major premise, where the minor premise is unknown. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 412, 434]\n\u00a0\n In Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, \n294 \nU.S. 550\n, 55 S.Ct. 525, this court held invalid a state act imposing a graduated tax measured by the amount of gross sales. We held that it could not be sustained as an excise on the privilege of merchandising, because there was no reasonable relation between the amount of the tax and the value of the privilege, and no such relation between gross sales and net profits as would justify the classification. The tax was denounced (\n294 \nU.S. 550\n, at page 557, 55 S.Ct. 525, 528) as being 'whimsical, and arbitrary, as much so as would be a tax on tangible personal property, say cattle, stepped up in rate on each additional animal owned by the taxpayer, or a tax on land similarly graduated according to the number of parcels owned.' We said (\n294 \nU.S. 550\n, at pages 558, 559, 55 S.Ct. 525, 529) 'that the gross sales of a merchant do not bear a constant relation to his net profits; that net profits vary from year to year in the same enterprise; that diverse kinds of merchandise yield differing ratios of profit; and that gross and net profits vary with the character of the business as well as its volume.' It appeared from the testimony that great variations existed within each class selected for comparison; that in some classes, representing a greater amount of sales, there was a smaller net profit than in others having less aggregate sales. To the contention that the tax was a rough and ready method of taxing gains, less complicated and more convenient of administration than an income tax, we answered (\n294 \nU.S. 550\n, at page 560, 55 S.Ct. 525, 529), 'The argument is in essence that it is difficult to be just and easy to be arbitrary. If the commonwealth desires to tax incomes, it must take the trouble equitably to distribute the burden of the impost.'\n These observations apply to the case in hand; for although the taxes imposed by the statutes involved are different, the vices are the same. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 58 S.Ct. 3, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No. 19 of 1932, Acts of Louisiana, 1932, p. 125. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Acts of Louisiana 1934, p. 251. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 16 F.Supp. 499, 503. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] State Board of Tax Commissioners v.

CO.(1937)\nNo. 716\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 647]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John B. Richards and Laurence E. Coffey, both of Buffalo, N.Y ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ray M. Stanley, of Buffalo, N.Y., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 648]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A collision occurred in the St. Clair river between the vessel George D. Dixon owned by the petitioner, Great Lakes Transit Corporation, and the vessel Willis L. King owned by the Interstate Steamship Company. Each owner brought a libel in admiralty against the other. The suits were consolidated. The Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company and other underwriters having paid to the petitioner, under insurance policies procured by it, the amount of cargo damage and loss which petitioner had paid to owners of the cargo carried by the Dixon, intervened and claimed the right through subrogation to recover the amount thus paid from the Interstate Steamship Company and its vessel, the King. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court entered a decree adjudging both vessels at fault and that the intervening underwriters should recover from each of the vessels and their respective owners a moiety of the amounts paid and payable under the policies. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 86 F.(2d) 740. In view of the importance of the issue, certiorari was granted, limited to the question of the correctness of the decree in directing recovery from the petitioner. March 8, 1937, \n300 \nU.S. 650\n, 57 S.Ct. 512, 81 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner's contention is that the insurance policies were contracts between the underwriters and the petitioner under which the latter was entitled to be indemnified for the liability it had assumed under its bill of lading and its tariff provisions; that the underwriters were not entitled to recover back from petitioner what they had paid it in discharge of their obligation. The underwriters insist that their policies insured cargo and that their pay \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 649]\n\u00a0\n ments were made for cargo's benefit; that, the cargo damage and loss having been paid, they were entitled by subrogation to a decree for the full damage against the King; that as both vessels were at fault the King was entitled to contribution from the Dixon; and that the decree in avoidance of circuity had fixed the ultimate liabilities by requiring each vessel to pay a moiety.\n The cargo on the Dixon was carried under uniform bills of lading, approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which after referring in section 9(a) to the exemptions contained in the Harter Act (46 U.S.C.  190 et seq., 46 U.S.C.A.  190, et seq.), provided in section 9(e) as follows:\n'If the property is being carried under a tariff which provides that any carrier or carriers party thereto shall be liable for loss from perils of the sea, then as to such carrier or carriers the provisions of this section shall be modified in accordance with the tariff provisions, which shall be regarded as incorporated into the conditions of this bill of lading.'\n\n The court below concluded, and we think rightly, that by the applicable tariffs the petitioner waived the saving clauses of the Harter Act and assumed full liability to the cargo owners for loss or damage caused by marine perils. 2 \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 650]\n\u00a0\n While these tariffs were not uniform, they also either stated or fairly imported that the specified rates should include marine insurance.\n The policies of insurance had the following rider, by which the underwriters agreed to insure the Great Lakes Transit Corporation, for account of whom it may concern, loss, if any, to be payable to the Great Lakes Transit Corporation or order,-\n'On cargo of any kind owned by the Assured and on the assured's liability to others in respect to cargo of any kind covering same from time said Great Lakes Transit Corporation becomes responsible therefor and until its responsibility ceases, wheresoever the same may be, including risks while on docks, in and\/or on cars on docks, piers, wharves, lighters and\/or craft, transfers, and all land conveyances, and also to cover upon any advances made by and payment of back charges made by or due from said Assured, and upon any charges of said Assured upon any and all cargo or any portion thereof; from the time the Assured becomes responsible for such cargo including risks of trans-shipment, and under and\/or on deck on board of the Assured's steamers: ...\n\n'Also to cover through to destination goods delivered by the Assured to other water transportation companies for shipment to destination.'\n\n The policies further provided that, the assured taking 'all the risks, perils and liabilities which by law a common carrier by land or water assumes, and also the insurance of said cargo against perils of the seas and lakes,' etc., the assurers agreed 'to indemnify and hold harmless' the assured against any loss or damage to cargo from all such risks, perils, etc., 'to the extent which the Assured may be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 651]\n\u00a0\n held by the owners thereof, under any liability the Assured shall have assumed as common carriers, insurers or otherwise.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n We are unable to accept the view that the provisions we have quoted cannot avail petitioner 'because it did not take upon itself the insurance of cargo or assume any liability with reference thereto as an insurer'; that 'its obligation as to insurance went no further than to require it to procure policies of insurance from others.' Petitioner did more than agree to obtain marine insur- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 652]\n\u00a0\n ance. Petitioner by its tariffs waived the provisions of the Harter Act and became itself an insurer of the cargo against marine perils. The agreement to obtain marine insurance did not detract from that undertaking. Had the underwriters been unable to respond to their contracts, petitioner would still have been liable to the cargo owners upon its own engagement. Having assumed that liability, petitioner was undoubtedly entitled to take out policies for its own protection. See Wyman, Partridge & Co. v. Boston & Maine R.R., 13 I.C.C. 258, 262; Id., 15 I.C.C. 577, 581; Id., 19 I.C.C. 551, 553. It is a familiar rule that a common carrier 'whether liable by law or custom to the same extent as an insurer, or only for his own negligence, may, in order to protect himself against his own responsibility, as well as to secure his lien, cause the goods in his custody to be insured to their full value.' Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Erie Transportation Co., \n117 \nU.S. 312, 323\n, 324 S., 6 S.Ct. 750, 755, and cases there cited. 'I see nothing remarkable,' said Lord Chief Justice Russell in Hill v. Scott, L.R. (1895), 2 Q.B.D. 371, 375, 'in the shipowner insuring himself. In a case where there was a bill of lading with widely sweeping exceptions, no doubt it would be unnecessary; but where, as here, there is no bill of lading, the shipowner frequently effects an insurance in order to protect himself against liability.' See, also, the same case, on appeal, Id., pp. 713, 714.\n The policies issued to petitioner explicitly afforded the protection which the petitioner was entitled to seek by virtue of the risks it had assumed. The petitioner was the 'Assured' named in the policies. Their terms contemplated that the assured as a common carrier would take upon itself full liability to the cargo owners for all damage and loss due to perils of the sea and the underwriters expressly agreed to indemnify the assured against that liability. There is no admissible construction of the policies which can eliminate or frustrate that undertak- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 653]\n\u00a0\n ing. In its presence, if ambiguities are raised by other clauses, they must be resolved so as still to give effect to the dominant purpose which the policies clearly reveal.\n The fact that the policies insured the petitioner, Great Lakes Transit Corporation, 'for account of whom it may concern' and that the loss was payable to the Great Lakes Transit Corporation 'or order' did not alter the fact that the Great Lakes Transit Corporation was itself directly concerned or detract from the stipulation running to that corporation as a carrier and affording it the specified indemnity. Nor does the fact that the cost of the insurance was included in the carrier's rate affect the question. The rate would properly cover all the reasonable expenses incident to the transportation, and when the carrier assumed liability to the cargo owners for damages and losses caused by marine perils, there was nothing unreasonable in the carrier's protecting itself against that risk by procuring insurance and covering the cost in its rate. Compare Wyman, Patridge & Co. v. Boston & Maine R. Co., supra. And if it be assumed, as we do assume, that the insurance would inure to the benefit of the cargo owners, that would be a protection to those owners additional to that afforded by the carrier's own engagement which still remained effective and covered by the stipulation in the policies for the benefit of the carrier. By reason of that coverage the underwriters were bound to pay, and did pay, to the petitioner, the amounts which the latter became liable to pay and had paid to the cargo owners under the contracts of carriage.\n These payments having been made, the underwriters now seek to recover back from the petitioner a moiety of what they have paid to it. It is said that this results from the admiralty rule for a division of damages in case of fault on the part of both vessels involved in the collision, and that the decree for a recovery by the underwriters from the petitioner is for the purpose of avoiding \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 654]\n\u00a0\n circuity of action. The effect none the less is to enable the underwriters to get back one-half of the amounts they had expressly agreed to pay to petitioner for its indemnity.\n The underwriters seek to sustain the decree by invoking the doctrine of subrogation, but the equity of subrogation invests the underwriters with the rights of the assured against third persons (Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Erie Transportation Co., supra; Wager v. Providence Insurance Co., \n150 \nU.S. 99, 108\n, 14 S.Ct. 55; Standard Marine Insurance Co. v. Scottish Assur. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 284, 286\n, 51 S.Ct. 371) not with a right to override its own obligation to the assured. Thus, when a bill of lading provides that in case of loss the carrier, if liable therefor, shall have the full benefit of any insurance effected upon the goods, the provision limits the right of subrogation of the insurer, upon payment to the shipper, to recover over against the carrier. Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Erie Transportation Co., supra; Wager v. Providence Insurance Co., supra. Such a clause giving the carrier the benefit of insurance effected by the shipper is valid 'because the carrier might himself have insured against the loss, even though occasioned by his own negligence; and if a shipper under a bill of lading containing this provision effects insurance and is paid the full amount of his loss, neither he nor the insurer can recover against the carrier.' Luckenbach v. W. J. McCahan Sugar Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 146\n, 39 S.Ct. 53, 54, 1 A.L.R. 1522. Following the same reasoning, we have said that 'If a valid claim by the underwriter to be subrogated to the rights of the owner will not arise where the carrier has contracted with the owner that he (the carrier) shall have the benefit of any insurance, it would seem to be clear that, where the carrier is actually and in terms the party insured, the underwriter can have no right to recover over against the carrier, even if the amount of the policy has been paid by the insurance company to the owner on the order of the carrier.' Wager v. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 646, 655]\n\u00a0\n Providence Insurance Co., supra, \n150 \nU.S. 99\n, at pages 108, 109, 14 S.Ct. 55, 58. See, also, The John Russell (C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 901, 902.\n Construing the policies in this instance as indemnifying the carrier against the liability which it had assumed by its bills of lading and tariffs to the cargo owners, the payments by the underwriters operated as a discharge of their obligation to the carrier and while, as the cargo owners had the benefit of the insurance, the underwriters could be subrogated to the right of the cargo owners against the King, they could not use that right to recover over against the carrier in defiance of their own stipulation. They could recover against the King the moiety for which the King was liable, but could not recover against the petitioner. The procedure in admiralty did not affect the substantive rights established by the policies.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The underwriters' claim also covered such additional amounts as they would be called upon to pay as further damages and losses to cargo were ascertained and were paid by petitioner. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is sufficient, for the present purpose, to quote the following from one of these tariffs filed by the petitioner:\n'Rule No. 15.-Marine Insurance.-Rates Named Herein Include Marine Insurance.-While shipments subject to rates named herein as including Marine Insurance are water-borne at and between lake ports, on the vessels of the Great Lakes Transit Corporation, said corporation assumes liability for loss or damage to said shipments caused by marine perils, to wit: Of the seas and lakes, fire, collision, stranding, jettisons, pirates, assailing thieves, barratry of the master or mariners and all other perils or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt or damage of said property, or any part thereof, including general average charges and expenses for which the owner may, under the Maritime Law, be chargeable, but excluding the risks of riots, war or insurrections; any loss from said marine perils for which said Corporation is liable hereunder, to be paid sixty days after proof of loss and proof of interest in said property have been furnished.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The text of the provision referred to is as follows:\n'It is agreed between the parties hereto that said steamers are to be employed in carrying cargo, or cargo and passengers, in and on said steamers as aforesaid, the Assured taking upon themselves as to said cargo, or parts thereof, all the risks, perils and liabilities which by law a common carrier by land or water assumes, and also the insurance of said cargo against perils of the seas and lakes, fire, jettisons, barratry, negligence of master or mariners, loss or damage arising through explosions howsoever or wheresoever occurring, bursting of boilers, breakage of shafts or through any latent defect in the machinery or hull, and all other acts, perils or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment, damage to or loss of the said cargo or any part thereof, and the said Assurers agree and undertake to indemnify and hold harmless the said Assured against hurt, detriment, damage to or loss of such cargo from any and all such risks, perils, acts or misfortunes, to the extent which the Assured may be held by the owners thereof, under any liability the Assured shall have assumed as common carriers, insurers, or otherwise, and for any and all claims which said cargo may be called upon to contribute in General Average, and\/or for salvage, landing, warehousing and\/or special charges, and to cover in like manner duties and any cargo owned by the Assured, and also all advances made by and payment of back charges made by or due from said Assured and\/or charges of said Assured upon any and all cargo or any portion thereof. ...\n\n'In case of loss, such loss to be paid thirty days after proof of loss and proof of interest are furnished to this company.

The relevant statutory provisions are:2\n'Section 1. That hereafter every person, firm or corporation engaged in business as a public utility and subject to regulation as to rates and charges by the department of public works, except auto transportation companies and steamboat companies holding certificates under chapter 248 of the Laws of 1927, shall, on or before the first day of April of each year, file with the department of public works a statement on oath showing its gross operating revenue for the preceding calendar year or portion thereof and pay to the department of public works a fee of 1\/10 of one per cent of such gross operating revenue: Provided, That the fee so paid shall in no case be less than ten dollars.'\n\n'Sec. 2. All sums collected by the director of public works under the provisions of this act shall within thirty days after their receipt be paid to the state treasurer, and by him deposited in a fund to be known as the public service revolving fund.'\n\n  The Supreme Court of the State has defined the exaction as a regulatory or inspection fee, and has declared that the fund created by the sums collected must be used solely for administering the State public service commission law. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n  The complaint4 alleges that the Department of Public Works exercises jurisdiction and supervision over sundry \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 157]\n\u00a0\n public utilities, including common carriers by rail, electric, and street railways, gas, electrical and water companies, telegraph and telephone companies, wharfingers, warehousemen, and carriers by water, engages in many activities disconnected from, and unrelated to, the inspection and supervision of rail carriers, and has a variety of duties in the enforcement of the State's police power. The complaint affirms that the fee is not based upon or restricted to the cost of legitimate regulation or supervision but is used to defray the costs of other activities in connection with railroads and also of supervising and inspecting unrelated public utilities and of performing other duties the expense of which cannot legitimately be imposed upon carriers by rail; that the fee is grossly in excess of the reasonable cost of inspection and regulation of railroads; that, to January 1, 1933, there had accumulated from the fees collected more than $250,000 in excess of the amount expended by the department in the discharge of all its duties; that the statute is in truth a revenue measure; that the State taxes plaintiff's property and other like property on an ad valorem basis. The complaint charges that the fee is a burden on, and a regulation of, interstate commerce in violation of article 1, section 8 of the Constitution; is so arbitrary, excessive, discriminatory, and unequal as to deny the plaintiff equal protection of the laws and to deprive it of property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  The answer admits plaintiff's payment under protest; admits that the Department of Public Works exercises jurisdiction and supervision over many classes of public utilites, including common carriers, and that the plaintiff's property within the State is assessed on an ad valorem basis for taxes like other property; admits plaintiff's capacity to sue; but denies substantially all other allegations of the complaint. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 158]\n\u00a0\n  The case was tried without a jury. The evidence largely consisted of the annual reports of the department. By the uncontradicted evidence and by the relevant statutes the following facts were established. The department has jurisdiction of various classes of public utilities, including railroads, electric and street railways, gas, electric and water companies, telegraph and telephone companies, wharfingers, warehousemen, and carriers by water, in respect of which it exercises many regulatory and supervisory duties. As respects railroads, the department constantly exercises functions unrelated to inspection and supervision, including the statutory duties of taking part in litigation before the Interstate Commerce Commission affecting the citizens of the State, and of acting judicially in decreeing refunds of overcharges. These functions, unrelated to the inspection and regulation of railroads, entail large expense. Between 1929 and 1933 the legislature made no appropriation from the State's general fund for the expenses of the department's activities, all being paid indiscriminately out of the department's fund derived from the fees collected from businesses subject to its jurisdiction. During this period the surplus accumulated from such receipts was $224,193.95, which was expended in 1934 in carrying on investigations of, and litigation with, public utility corporations other than railroads. No separate accounts are kept, or required by law to be kept, with respect to the expense of these various activities, and it is impossible to determine from the records and accounts of the department the expense of inspecting and regulating railroads separate and apart from the expense of regulating other utilities or other functions of the department.\n  The plaintiff called the department's auditor who testified that the charge of one-tenth of one per cent of gross income collected from utilities goes to build up a fund \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 159]\n\u00a0\n from which all the department's expenses are paid; that he had figures classifying the expenditures according to the various kinds of utilities with which the department is concerned. These calculations he had made for himself, there being no duty under the law to keep accounts on this basis. He testified that, in computing the expenditures in connection with railroads, he lumped them as railroad charges and made no separation of the costs of inspection and regulation, the costs of rate hearings, and the costs of reparation proceedings, although the evidence establishes that many of the railroad charges had to do with reparation cases and litigation before the Interstate Commerce Commission. At the close of plaintiff's case, the defendant recalled the auditor as its own witness. He testified that the disbursements chargeable to the railroads for the period 1929 to 1933, inclusive, exceeded the receipts from railroads in the same period by $37,833. He did not, however, qualify what he had previously stated, that, in making up these figures, he had lumped all railroad charges, whether for inspection and regulation or interstate commerce cases or reparation cases. Upon cross-examination it developed that the figures he submitted were not official, and, so far as they covered salary items, had been made up from slips which the various employes, at his request, had turned in monthly allocating the time each employe spent in the various branches of the work, and the witness had no personal knowledge of the accuracy of these slips. Plaintiff objected to the testimony and moved to strike it on the ground that it was hearsay but the court let it stand, subject to the objection. A judgment awarded the plaintiff by the trial court was reversed by the Supreme Court.\n  The principles governing decision have repeatedly been announced and were not questioned below. In the exercise of its police power the state may provide for the supervision and regulation of public utilities, such as rail \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 160]\n\u00a0\n roads; may delegate the duty to an officer or commission; and may exact the reasonable cost of such supervision and regulation from the utilities concerned and allocate the exaction amongst the members of the affected class without violating the rule of equality imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n5\n The supervision and regulation of the local structures and activities of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce, and the imposition of the reasonable expense thereof upon such corporation, is not a burden upon, or regulation of, interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. \n6\n A law exhibiting the intent to impose a compensatory fee for such a legitimate purpose is prima facie reasonable. \n7\n If the exaction be so unreasonable and disproportionate to the service as to impugn the good faith of the law8 it cannot stand either under the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment. \n9\n The State is not bound to adjust the charge after the fact, but may, in anticipation, fix what the legislature deems to be a fair fee for the expected service, the presumption being that if, in practice, the sum charged appears inordinate the legislative body will reduce it in the light of experience. \n10\n Such a statute may, in spite of the presumption of validity, show on its \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 161]\n\u00a0\n face that some part of the exaction is to be used for a purpose other than the legitimate one of supervision and regulation and may, for that reason, be void. \n11\n And a statute fair upon its face may be shown to be void and unenforceable on account of its actual operation. \n12\n If the exaction be clearly excessive it is bad in toto and the state cannot collect any part of it. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n  The contention is that the challenged statute is void on its face since it discloses that the fee charged the appellant is not imposed for, or limited by, the reasonable cost of supervision or regulation of its business; and, if this is not so, the case made in respect of the act's operation cast on the appellee the burden of proof, which it failed to carry.\n  The Supreme Court of the state based its decision in favor of the validity of the statute on two grounds: First, that the act is not unconstitutional on its face; secondly, that, as the answer denied the material allegations of the complaint concerning the operative effect of the act, the plaintiff had the burden of proof, which it failed to sustain; and, if the burden was shifted by the case made by the plaintiff, the evidence preponderated in favor of the defendant.\n  First. The statute does not exhibit a failure reasonably to adjust the fee to the expense of the supervision and regulation of railroads. The legislation is to be accorded the presumption of fairness and regularity. It cannot be deduced from the provisions of the act that the amounts collected from the railroads grossly exceed those legitimately expended for inspection and regulation. The ap- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 162]\n\u00a0\n pellant insists that such is the necessary inference from the circumstance that the same fee is exacted from public utilities generally, and the collections go into a single fund and are indiscriminately disbursed for the many branches of the department's work. But these facts, without more, do not prove that the amounts derived from the railroads are in excess of the legitimate expenses of inspection and regulation. It may be that, in spite of this lumping of receipts and expenditures, the fees paid by the railroads are no more than enough to defray such expenses. The court below was, therefore, justified in refusing to hold the statute void on its face.\n  Second. The court thought the plaintiff had the burden of showing that the sums exacted from rail carriers substantially exceeded the amounts expended for regulation and supervision, and the proofs offered were insufficient to shift the burden to the defendant. This view was erroneous. Foote & Co., Inc., v. Stanley, \n232 \nU.S. 494\n.\n  In that case it appeared that the plaintiffs were packers of oysters taken from the waters of Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey, and shipped to Baltimore. A statute of Maryland required that the oysters be inspected at Baltimore (Code Pub.Gen.Laws Md.1904, art. 72,  69, as amended by Laws 1910, c. 413, p. 208). It imposed a charge of one cent a bushel 'to help defray the expenses of such inspection and the other expenses of the State Fishery Force, upon all oysters unloaded from vessels at the place where said oysters are to be no further shipped in bulk in vessels.' The plaintiffs refused to pay the exaction and, upon threat of enforcement, filed a bill in a state court for injunction alleging the fee was excessive, a burden on interstate commerce, and a violation of the constitutional provision that 'No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws.' (Const. art. 1 ,  10) The Maryland Court of Appeals (117 Md. 335, 82 A. 380) affirmed a decree dismissing the bill and this \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 163]\n\u00a0\n court reversed its decision. The plaintiff asserted that as the act laid the fee for the expense of inspection, 'and other expenses,' it was obvious that the state had provided for the collection of more than was necessary for inspection. To this the state answered that the section levying the fee was but a part of an elaborate system of inspection imposed upon the state fishery force. It appeared from the evidence, as it does here, that the fishery force had duties other than those of inspection which were to be paid for out of the fund produced by the fees. This court said (\n232 \nU.S. 494\n, at page 503, 378): 'But while the two duties may sometimes overlap, there is a difference between policing and inspection, and if the state imposes upon one set of officers the performance of the two duties, and pays the whole or a part of the joint expenses out of inspection fees, it must be made to appear that such tax does not materially exceed the cost of inspection,- the burden in such cases being on those seeking to collect the combined charge.' And said further (\n232 \nU.S. 494\n, at page 506, 380): 'But the commingling of these various duties, paid for out of a fund raised for inspection, does not necessarily show that the fee is excessive. For the presumption of invalidity arising from such intermingling might be met by carrying the burden of showing that, while the statute required payment out of which joint fund, the collections were not sufficient, but only helped, to pay the definitely ascertained expenses of inspection. The question of reasonableness, therefore, may be considered in the light of the practical operation of the law with a view of determining, with reasonable certainty, the permanent relation between the amount collected and the cost of inspecting.'\n  The court examined the evidence as to the operation of a prior law which levied the same charge per bushel and which the challenged act superseded, consisting of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 164]\n\u00a0\n annual reports of the comptroller, and found therefrom that one-third of the amount collected was sufficient to pay the cost of inspection and the other two-thirds had been appropriated to 'other expenses of the Fishery Force.' In the light of the operation of the previous act, and the failure of the state to show that the amount collected under the new law would not be more than was necessary for the expenses of inspection proper, the challenged statute was held void.\n  There are factual distinctions between the cited case and the instant one, but they do not affect the binding authority of the former. The law under consideration in the Foote Case was purely an inspection measure. That here under review is characterized by the state court as one for regulation and inspection. The specific mandate of the Federal Constitution limiting state inspection fees to an amount absolutely necessary for executing a state's inspection laws was treated in the Foote Case as raising the same issue as was presented in earlier decisions with respect to the bearing of the commerce clause upon the imposition of regulatory and inspection fees imposed upon local property of interstate enterprises. And the cases decided under the commerce clause dealing with the reasonableness of regulation and inspection fees have been treated by this court as apposite to the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the Foote Case reference to the accounts and records kept by state authority disclosed the extent of the excess of receipts over expenditures, whereas here it is demonstrated that while expenses other than those of inspection and regulation of railroads are paid out of the fees, the amount of the excess over what is necessary for regulation and inspection cannot be ascertained from the department's accounts. The Foote Case is authority that in such circumstances the burden is on those seeking to collect the charge. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 165]\n\u00a0\n  The State Supreme Court, after holding that the plaintiff failed to carry its burden, and that no duty of showing the amount necessary for inspection and regulation of railroads lay upon the defendant, proceeded to discuss the evidence and reached the conclusion that the proof preponderated in favor of the defendant. This conclusion was based upon the testimony of the department auditor that he had found from memoranda furnished him, and data collected by him, what had been expended in connection with railroads exceeded what they had paid. As already noted the appellant insists that this evidence was inadmissible and lacked value because hearsay.\n  The state court said: 'While the account kept by the auditor was not official, in the sense that of itself it was admissible in evidence, yet what the auditor did in that respect qualified him to testify as to the ultimate fact. Without further detailing the evidence, we will say that in our opinion, and in so far as there was any evidence on the subject, it preponderated against the findings made by the court as to the cost of supervising and regulating railroads.' 184 Wash. 648, 52 P.(2d) 1274, 1277.\n  Passing the appellant's contention that a federal right may not be denied under the guise of the application of a state rule of evidence,14 we come to the question whether, when the asserted right has been denied, this court is concluded by a finding of fact or a mixed finding of law and fact made by the state court. We have repeatedly held that in such case we must examine the evidence to ascertain whether it supports the decision against the claim of federal right. A recent exposition \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 166]\n\u00a0\n of the doctrine is found in Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n, a case coming here from a state court, in which the appellant claimed that he had been denied due process by the systematic and intentional exclusion of negroes from the jury lists. The state court held that the evidence did not establish such exclusion. This court reviewed the evidence, reached a conclusion contrary to that of the state court, and reversed the judgment. At pages 589, 590 of 294 \nU.S., 580, it was said: 'The question is of the application of this established principle to the facts disclosed by the record. That the question is one of fact does not relieve us of the duty to determine whether in truth a federal right has been denied. When a federal right has been specially set up and claimed in a state court, it is our province to inquire not merely whether it was denied in express terms but also whether it was denied in substance and effect. If this requires an examination of evidence, that examination must be made. Otherwise, review by this Court would fail of its purpose in safeguarding constitutional rights. Thus, whenever a conclusion of law of a state court as to a federal right and findings of fact are so intermingled that the latter control the former, it is incumbent upon us to analyze the facts in order that the appropriate enforcement of the federal right may be assured.'\n  In Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, the validity of a state inheritance tax act was challenged in a state court, the claim being that the act operated to take property without due process if held to apply to property having no situs in the state. The state court held that intangible property, the transfer of which was sought to be taxed, had acquired a business situs in South Carolina. This court re-examined the question, in the light of the evidence, and overruled the state court's decision, saying (\n282 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 8, 55): \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 167]\n\u00a0\n But a conclusion that debts have thus acquired a business situs must have evidence to support it, and it is our province to inquire whether there is such evidence when the inquiry is essential to the enforcement of a right suitably asserted under the federal Constitution.'\n  In Johnson Oil Company v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158\n, there was drawn in question the validity of ad valorem taxes laid under a state statute upon the entire fleet of the appellant's tank cars. It was charged that the cars did not have a situs within the state and there was, therefore, no jurisdiction to tax them. The Supreme Court of the State held that all the cars had their taxable situs within the state. This court examined the evidence, reached a contrary conclusion, and reversed the judgment, saying (\n290 \nU.S. 158\n, at pages 159, 160, 153): 'As the asserted federal right turns upon the determination of the question of situs, it is our province to analyze the facts in order to apply the law, and thus to ascertain whether the conclusion of the state court has adequate support in the evidence.'\n  Citation of authority for the same principle might be multiplied indefinitely. \n 15\n\u00a0\n\n  While holding the testimony of the department auditor competent, the state court omits to refer to the fact that the figures he presented were not allocated so as to show the amounts spent for inspection and regulation and those expended for other so-called railroad charges which could not be imposed upon the railroads. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 168]\n\u00a0\n As has been pointed out, the evidence is uncontradicted and conclusive that the sums he mentioned as having been expended for railroad account did include substantial, and apparently large, amounts for activities in the interest of interstate shippers and for the trial of reparation cases. It is impossible to sustain the state court's conclusion that such testimony had any probative value upon the sole issue in the cause, which was whether the statute subjects the railroads to an unreasonably excessive charge for inspection and regulation. As was said in the Foote Case, the state is at liberty to intermingle duties involving costs properly chargeable to the railroads, with others involving costs not so chargeable, but if it does so, and the exaction is challenged, it must assume the burden of showing that the sums exacted from the appellant do not exceed what is reasonably needed for the service rendered. The State failed to carry this burden.\n  It results that the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with thus opinion.\n  So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO, dissenting.\n  To show that the revolving fund was used as a common pot for the regulation of public utilities generally, irrespective of their special function, does not make out a case of wrong to railroads considered as a separate class or to appellant in particular. For the purposes of this case there is no need to inquire whether anything in the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the recognition of a single and all-inclusive class of public service corporations without further subdivision. If the prohibition be assumed, still the burden is on the railroads to satisfy the court that what was contributed by them was more than what was expended for their account, since otherwise the common pot may have been a help and not a hurt. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 169]\n\u00a0\n That burden was not discharged. Far from being discharged, there was a disclaimer of any attempt or purpose to discharge it. And so the case must fail. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 689, 690, 628, 629.\n  The decision in Foote & Co., Inc. v. Stanley, \n232 \nU.S. 494\n, much relied on by appellant, is inapplicable here. That was a case under article 1,  10, of the Constitution, which provides that 'no State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws.' Maryland passed an act for the payment of charges, characterized as inspection fees, upon imports of oysters from neighboring states. The 'inspectors' did more than inspect that oysters; they policed the waters of Chesapeake Bay, being thus policemen as well as inspectors. On its face the act provided that a fee of one cent per bushel should be 'levied to help pay the salary of the inspectors and the other expenses of the State Fishery Force.' \n232 \nU.S. 494\n, at page 505, 379. In these circumstances the ruling was that in a suit for an injunction brought by the importers the state had the burden of showing that the fee was not an unreasonable one for the service of inspection as distinguished from the other services covered thereby. Imposts upon interstate commerce being generally prohibited, and being lawful only when 'absolutely necessary' for the purpose of inspection, a charge covering the service of inspection and also something else must collapse in its entirety unless the state is in a position to break it up into its elements. A power has been granted to be used in exceptional conditions. The state must bring itself within the exception if it seeks to act within the grant.\n  A very different situation confronts us in the case at hand. Here the statute of the state does not trespass upon a field of legislation where entry is forbidden with \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 170]\n\u00a0\n out the license of the nation. What has been done is well within the field of general legislative power, with every presumption of validity back of it. In such circumstances the burden of making good a claim of invalidity and thus establishing an exception is on the assailants of the rule, and not on its proponents. The conclusion becomes clearer when the statute is analyzed more closely. All that it does is to exact of public utilities generally (with particular exceptions) a fee of 1\/10th of one per cent of their gross revenues, confined, however, to operations in intrastate commerce, the fee when collected to be paid into a revolving fund. Laws of Washington, 1929, p. 209, c. 107; Laws of 1923, p. 290, c. 107; Laws of 1921, p. 354, c. 113. Another statute (Laws of Washington, 1929, p. 210, c. 108) lays a heavier tax (one per cent.), to be paid into the same fund, upon the receipts of autotransportation companies. Steamship companies of a stated class are subject to a special rule, the fee in their case being one-fifth of one per cent. Laws of Washington, 1927, pp. 382, 384, c. 248. Plainly there is no presumption that these varying contributions are out of proportion to the expenses incurred in supervising and regulating the several classes of contributors. Illegality, if there is any, is to be found in the administration of the statute, and not in anything inherent in its essential scheme and framework. That being so, the taxpayer may not rest upon a showing of possible overpayment. There must be a showing of an overpayment not merely possible but actual, and one substantial in amount. Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. North Carolina, supra; Foote & Co., Inc., v. Stanley, supra. To hold otherwise would be to go counter to the settled rule that 'one who would strike down a state statute as obnoxious to the Federal Constitution must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him.' Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, \n298 \nU.S. 226, 227\n, 56 S. Ct. 754, 755. Analogies drawn from the law of trusts are inapposite and mis- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 171]\n\u00a0\n leading. The state does not collect the taxes or place them in the fund as trustee for the contributor or for any one else. It receives the moneys and expends them as an owner, charged with no other duty to a particular group of taxpayers than to members of the public generally.\n  The burden resting on the railroads to show that the use of the common pot has resulted to their damage, the record must be scrutinized to see whether the burden has been borne. In that scrutiny there is no denial of a duty to inquire whether the decision of the state court, irrespective of its surface protestations, amounts in substance and reality to the denial of a federal right. Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587, 589\n, 580; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 55. There is a recognition of the duty, and an endeavor to fulfill it.\n  1. The trial court suggested to counsel for appellant that it would be interesting to know whether the amount that had been collected through the tax upon the railroads was in excess of the amount expended for their benefit. Counsel responded that he would not embark on that inquiry. His position was stated to be that the act was invalid on its face, in which event it would be vain to pursue the subject further. This court by its opinion has rejected that contention. The act is not invalid on its face, whether valid or invalid otherwise.\n  2. Explaining or at least supplementing the refusal to compare disbursements and receipts, counsel stated on the trial that there were no records available. But the contrary was clearly proved. The auditor of the Department of Public Works caused the employees of the department to submit vouchers or slips descriptive of their services with an appropriate segregation and apportionment among the several classes of utilities. He testified on the basis of these reports, which were on file in his office, that disbursements for account of the rail \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 172]\n\u00a0\n roads were in excess by $37,833.14 of the railroads' contributions. Counsel for appellant expresses his belief that inspection and discovery of the contents of the vouchers would have yielded inadequate information. His business was to look and see.\n  3. The objection will not hold that the documents might be ignored for the reason that, if produced, they would be incompetent as evidence. Apart from the possibility of examining the men who made them, it is the law of the state of Washington, declared in this very case, that the slips and vouchers so filed in the course of the business of the bureau were sufficient to support the testimony of the auditor as to the conclusions to be drawn from them. Referring to that subject, the court said: 'While the account kept by the auditor was not official, in the sense that of itself it was admissible in evidence, yet what the auditor did in that respect qualified him to testify as to the ultimate fact. Without further detailing the evidence, we will say that in our opinion, and in so far as there was any evidence on the subject, it preponderated against the findings made by the (trial) court as to the cost of supervising and regulating railroads.' 184 Wash. 648, 52 P.(2d) 1274, 1277.\n  Whether the evidence thus accepted and relied upon would be rejected by other courts either as hearsay or on other grounds is quite beside the point. The Fourteenth Amendment does not confine the states to the common- law rules of evidence, however well established. West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258, 262\n, 263; Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 \nU.S. 172, 174\n, 175, 78; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 101\n; Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 25\n. 'The state is not tied down by any provision of the Federal Constitution to the practice and procedure which existed at the common law.' Brown v. New Jersey, supra. The acceptance of the testimony of the auditor does not touch the privilege of confrontation in a prose \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 173]\n\u00a0\n cution for a crime. Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 106\n, 332, 90 A.L.R. 575. It does not substitute hearsay for direct testimony generally or as to every possible issue arising in a case. At most it is an enlargement of the common-law rule as to entries in books of account or in public or official documents. Cf. Wigmore, Evidence vol. 3,  1517 et seq;  1630 et seq.\n  Hearsay is competent evidence by the law of many enlightened countries. Stumberg, Guide to the Law and Legal Literature of France, pp. 148, 149; Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, title Evidence; vol. v., pp. 646, 647. Even at common law it is competent at certain times and for certain purposes, though narrowly restricted. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 3,  1420 etseq.; Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, p. 518. The range of its competence has been greatly enlarged by statutes in many of the states, as, e.g., in the administration of Workmen's Compensation Laws, and by the relaxation of ancient rules as to entries in accounts. Dodd, Administration of Workmen's Compensation, pp. 227-236; Wigmore, Evidence, Supplement, 1934,  1519, 1520; Morgan v. others, The Law of Evidence, p. 51; New York Civil Practice Act,  374a; cf. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Norwich P. Co. (C.C.A.) 18 F.(2d) 934; Cub Fork Coal Co. v. Fairmont Glass Co. (C.C.A.)  19 F.(2d) 273; United States v. Cotter (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 689. The question may be laid aside whether a change in the law of evidence might be so radical and unjust as to work a destruction of fundamental rights and thus a denial of due process. Brown v. New Jersey, supra, \n175 \nU.S. 172\n, at page 175, 20 S. Ct. 77. Assuming such a possibility, there is nothing in this ruling to make it a reality. If the legislature of Washington had passed a statute to the effect that vouchers in a public office, filed by the employees at the bidding of a superior, should be prima facie evidence of the truth of their contents, it is not open \n\n[300 \nU.S. 154\n, 174]\n\u00a0\n to doubt that such a statute would be valid. It would not even involve an extreme departure from common law analogies rooted in the presumption of official regularity. What a state may do in changing the rules of evidence through the action of its legislature, it may do with equal competence through the action of its judges, for anything to the contrary in the Constitution of the United States.\n  4. Appellant did not discharge its burden by proving in a vague way that some of the disbursements classified by the auditor as a charge against the railroads were incidental to proceedings conducted before the Interstate Commerce Commission or elsewhere for the benefit of private shippers and were not properly a part of the expense of local regulation.\n  The Attorney General takes the ground that disbursements from the revolving fund, if made for that purpose, were without authority of law. If that be so, they cannot avail to invalidate the statute, though they may lay the basis for a remedy in behalf of the state or others against the officers or agents guilty of unintentional misfeasance. Aside, however, from that objection, there was no attempt by appellant to prove the amount of these or like withdrawals in even the roughest fashion. There was no suggestion, much less evidence, that they would wipe out the excess of $37, 833.14 stated by the auditor. An inquiry directed to the point would have yielded in all likelihood an estimate at least approximately correct. If such inquiry was inadequate, the slips and vouchers were available for scrutiny and dissection. Examination of the auditor in connection with the documents would have shown forth the truth.\n  The presumption of validity which sustains an act of legislation is unbroken by the evidence.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 686\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 184 Wash. 648, 52 P.(2d) 1274. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 107, p. 209, Washington Session Laws of 1929.

Spence, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the meaning and scope of the phrase 'a party to a reorganization' as used in section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928.1\n January 29, 1929, the petitioner, and all other shareholders of Metals Refining Company, an Indiana corporation, hereinafter designated Indiana, entered into a contract with the Glidden Company, an Ohio corporation, reciting that the shareholders of Indiana were desirous of merging and consolidating the properties of their company with Glidden and with a corporation Gildden was to organize under the laws of Ohio, which corporation we shall call Ohio. The shareholders covenanted that they would assign their shares to Ohio, which was to have a specified capital structure divided into preferred and common shares, and Gildden covenanted that it would issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered to the shareholders a stated number of shares of its own prior preference stock at an agreed valuation, a stated number of shares of the preferred stock of Ohio, also at an agreed valuation, and sufficient cash to equal the appraised value of Indiana's assets as of March 1, 1929, and that, after the exchange of stock, Gildden would cause Indiana to transfer its assets to Ohio.\n Glidden organized Ohio and became the owner of all its common stock but none of its preferred stock. Pursuant to the contract the shareholders of Indiana transferred their stock to Ohio and received therefor a total consideration of $1,207,016 consisting of Glidden prior preference stock valued at $533,980, shares of the pre- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 84]\n\u00a0\n ferred stock of Ohio valued at $500,000, and $153,036 in cash. Indiana then transferred its assets to Ohio and was dissolved.\n As a result of the reorganization petitioner received shares of Glidden stock, shares of Ohio stock, and $17,293 in cash. In his return for 1929 he included the $17,293 as income received but ignored the shares of Glidden and of Ohio as stock received in exchange in a reorganization. The respondent ruled that Glidden was not a party to a reorganization within the meaning of the Revenue Act, treated the transaction as a taxable exchange to the extent of the cash and shares of Glidden, and determined a deficiency of $7,420. Upon receipt of notice to this effect the petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals which reversed the Commissioner, holding that Glidden was a party to a reorganization. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board. \n2\n We granted the writ of certiorari because of an alleged conflict of decision. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 112(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  112(b)(3) and note) declares that 'No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, exchanged solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization.' If the transaction involves the receipt of such stock or securities and 'also of other property or money' then the gain, if any, is to be recognized in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property. (Section 112(c)(1), 26 U.S.C.A.  112(c)(1) and note.)\n Section 112(i)(1) declares: 'The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 85]\n\u00a0\n voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation), or (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred, or (C) a recapitalization, or (D) a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.' Subsection (2) is: 'The term 'a party to a reorganization' includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the case of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation.' 26 U.S.C.A.  112(g)(1, 2) note.\n It is agreed that under the plain terms of the statute the cash received by the petitioner was income, and that as the stock of Ohio was obtained in part payment for that of Indiana, the exchange, to that extent, did not give rise to income to be included in the computation of petitioner's tax.\n The question is whether that portion of the consideration consisting of prior preference shares of Glidden should be recognized in determining petitioner's taxable gain. The decision of this question depends upon whether Glidden's stock was that of a party to the reorganization for, if so, the statute declares gain or loss due to its receipt shall not be included in the taxpayer's computation of income for the year in which the exchange was made.\n If section 112(i)(2) is a definition of a party to a reorganization and excludes corporations not therein described, Glidden was not a party since its relation to the transaction is not within the terms of the definition. It was not a corporation resulting from the reorganization; and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 86]\n\u00a0\n it did not acquire a majority of the shares of voting stock and a majority of the shares of all other classes of stock of any other corporation in the reorganization. The Circuit Court of Appeals thought the section was intended as a definition of the term party as used in the act and excluded all corporations not specifically described. It therefore held Glidden could not be considered a party to the reorganization.\n The petitioner contends, we think correctly, that the section is not a definition but rather is intended to enlarge the connotation of the term 'a party to a reorganization' to embrace corporations whose relation to the transaction would not in common usage be so denominated or as to whose status doubt might otherwise arise. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that when an exclusive definition is intended the word 'means' is employed, as in the section we have quoted defining reorganization and in section 112(j), 26 U.S.C.A.  112(h) and note, defining the term 'control,' whereas here the word used is 'includes.' If more were needed section 701( b) 26 U.S.C.A.  1696(17) declares: 'The terms 'includes' and 'including' when used in a definition (contained in this Act) shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.'\n The Treasury, in its regulations, has construed the section as not embodying an exclusive definition. \n4\n The administrative construction of an identical section in the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 has been the same. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 87]\n\u00a0\n If the shareholders of A, and those of B, should agree to convey their stock to a new corporation C, in exchange for C's stock, a reorganization, as defined in section 112(i)(1) would be effected. But it might well be contended, were it not for section 112(i)(2), that the shareholders of the old corporations had not received stock in a nontaxable exchange, as specified in section 112(b)(3), since the new corporation C was not a party to the exchange. In the present instance, Indiana had no part in the transaction. The shareholders agreed to transfer their stock to Ohio in exchange for securities. Indiana, as such, was not a party to any agreement and took no corporate action. If the plan had contemplated the continued existence of Indiana, and part payment of its shareholders in bonds or preferred stock of that company, and part in shares of Ohio, while this would clearly have constitued a reorganization as defined by the act, it might, with reason, be urged that, as respects the bonds or preferred stock of Indiana, the exchange was taxable since Indiana was not a party to the reorganization. Section 112(i)(2) precludes the contention. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Plainly, however, there may be corporate parties to reorganizations, within the meaning of the statute, other than those enumerated in section 112(i)(2). Thus if corporations A and B transfer all their assets to C, a new corporation, in exchange for all C's stock, the stock received is not a basis for calculation of gain on the exchange. \n7\n A and B are so evidently parties to the reorganization that we do not need section 112(i)(2) to inform us of the fact.\n Again, if company A transfers all its assets to company B, a going concern, upon the agreement of B to issue to A's shareholders its stock in such amount that they \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 88]\n\u00a0\n will own 80 per cent. of every class of B's outstanding stock, the consummation of the agreement will be a reorganization under the act. \n8\n Unquestionably the gain ensuing upon the exchange of stock by A's shareholders will not be taxable since the stock received by them is that of B, a party to the reorganization, though B is not described as such in section 112(i)(2). We must, therefore, irrespective of Glidden's failure to qualify as a party under that section, determine whether its relation to the reorganization is that of a party within the ordinary connotation of the term.\n Glidden was a party to an agreement with the shareholders of Indiana and the agreement envisaged a reorganization as defined by section 112(i)( 1)(A) for it contemplated that Ohio should acquire all of the stock of Indiana. The agreement was fulfilled. But the crucial question is whether Glidden was a party to the reorganization thus effected. Glidden received nothing from the shareholders of Indiana. The exchange was between Indiana's shareholders and Ohio. Do the facts that Glidden contracted for the exchange and made it possible by subscribing and paying for Ohio's common stock in cash so that Ohio could consummate the exchange, render Glidden a party to the reorganization? No more so than if a banking corporation had made the agreement with Indiana's shareholders and had organized the new corporation, and, by subscription to its stock and payment therefor in money and the banking company's stock put the new company in position to complete the exchange. Not every corporate broker, promoter, or agent which enters into a written agreement effectuating a reorganization, as defined in the Revenue Act, thereby becomes a party to the reorganization. And, if it is not a party, its stock received in exchange, pursuant to the plan, is- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 89]\n\u00a0\n 'other property' mentioned in section 112(c)(1) and must be reckoned in computing gain or loss to the recipient. Glidden was, in the transaction in question, no more than the efficient agent in bringing about a reorganization. It was not, in the natural meaning of the term, a party to the reorganization.\n It is argued, however, that Ohio was the alter ego of Glidden; that in truth Glidden was the principal and Ohio its agent; that we should look at the realities of the situation, disregard the corporate entity of Ohio, and treat it as Glidden. But to do so would be to ignore the purpose of the reorganization sections of the statute, which, as we have said, is that where, pursuant to a plan, the interest of the stockholders of a corporation continues to be definitely represented in substantial measure in a new or different one, then to the extent, but only to the extent, of that continuity of interest, the exchange is to be treated as one not giving rise to present gain or loss. \n9\n If cash or 'other property,' that is, property other than stock or securities of the reorganized corporations, is received, present gain of loss must be recognized. Was not Glidden's prior preference stock 'other property' in the sense that its ownership represented a participation in assets in which Ohio, and its shareholders through it, had no proprietorship? Was it not 'other property' in the sense that qua that stock the shareholders of Indiana assumed a relation toward the conveyed assets not measured by a continued substantial interest in those assets in the ownership of Ohio, but an interest in the assets of Glidden a part of which was the common stock of Ohio? These questions we think must be answered in the affirmative. To reject the plain meaning of the term 'party,' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 82, 90]\n\u00a0\n and to attribute that relation to Glidden, would be not only to disregard the letter but also to violate the spirit of the Revenue Act.\n We hold that Glidden was not a party to the reorganization and the receipt of its stock by Indiana's shareholders in exchange, in part, for their stock was the basis for computation of taxable gain to them in the year 1929.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 852, 45 Stat. 791, 816, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 and note. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 86 F.(2d) 670. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Sage v.

Hassett, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Denis M. Kelleher, of Fort Dodge, Iowa, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clair E. Hamilton, of Winterset, Iowa, and Leon W. Powers, of Denison, Iowa, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether interest upon bonds of the state of Iowa or its political subdivisions may be included in the assessment of a tax on the net income of the owners without detracting from earlier exemptions in respect of taxes upon property and without an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contract.\n Appellants, residents of Iowa, were the owners in 1934 and afterwards of Iowa School District bonds, Iowa Road bonds, Iowa County bonds, and an Iowa Soldiers' Bonus bond, of the face value, aside from interest, of $752, 900. The statutes of the state in force when the bonds were issued and when the appellants acquired ownership provide in varying but equivalent terms that such bonds 'are not to be taxed,'1 'shall not be taxed,'2 or 'shall be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n exempt from taxation.' \n3\n Iowa was without an income tax when these exemptions were declared. A 'Personal Net Income Tax' upon persons resident within the state was imposed for the first time by a statute enacted in 1934. Code 1935,  6943-f4 et seq. In the assessment of that tax for 1935 interest on appellants' bonds in the sum of $36,893.75 was included by the State Board of Assessment and Review against appellants' protest that the law, if so applied, impaired the obligation of contracts of exemption. Constitution of the United States, art. 1,  10. By appropriate proceedings the controversy was brought to the Supreme Court of Iowa, where the assessment was upheld. 271 N.W. 168. The court assumed, without deciding, that the statutes of exemption should be treated as giving rise to contracts, and not merely as declarations of a legislative policy subject to revocation at the legislative pleasure. Proceeding on that assumption, the court interpreted the contracts as limited to taxes laid directly upon property in proportion to its value, and not as touching taxes in the nature of an excise upon the net income of an owner. This conclusion was supported by an analysis of the Iowa statutes and a review of Iowa decisions as well as the decisions of this and other courts. The case is here upon appeal. 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344).\n We make the same assumption that was made in the state court as to the existence of a contract, without indicating thereby how we would rule upon the point if a ruling were essential. Cf. People of State of New York ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist, \n262 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 43 S.Ct. 501, 502; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 489\n, 52 S.Ct. 424, 425; Wisconsin & Michigan Ry.

Essential it is not for the decision of this case if the con- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n tract to be assumed is limited in scope and operation as it was limited below. Whether the limitation should be accepted is thus the pivotal inquiry. The power is ours, when the impairment of an obligation is urged against a law, to determine for ourselves the effect and meaning of the contract as well as its existence.

Even so, we lean toward agreement with the courts of the state, and accept their judgment as to such matters unless manifestly wrong. Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319, 322\n, 323 S., 57 S.Ct. 483, 484, 485; Violet Trapping Co. v. Grace, \n297 \nU.S. 119, 120\n, 56 S.Ct. 386; Tampa Waterworks Co. v. Tampa, \n199 \nU.S. 241, 243\n, 244 S., 26 S.Ct. 23; Dodge v. Board of Education of Chicago, supra. For reasons to be developed, obvious error is not discernible in the ruling of the highest court of Iowa that the statutory exemptions invoked by the appellants were not intended to include taxes upon the net income derived from business or investments. To the contrary, the decision has support in the statutory system of taxation viewed in its entirety, in state decisions both in the courts of Iowa and elsewhere before the bonds were bought and afterwards, and even indeed in decisions of this court. Our search is for something more than the meaning of a property tax or an excise in the thought of skilled economists or masters of finance. It is for the meaning that at a particular time and place and in the setting of a particular statute might reasonably have acceptance by men of common understanding.\n\n 1. \nThe limitation affixed to the contracts of exemption has support, first of all, in the statutory system of taxation considered as a whole.\n Of the total interest ($36,893.75) collected on appellants' bonds, the greater portion ($32,776.25) is protected, if at all, by reason of the exemption given to bonds issued by any school district or county within the state. That exemption may best be studied as it stood in the Supple- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n mental Supplement to 1915 Code. \n4\n It was then subdivision 1 of section 1304. There were other subdivisions exempting other items-the grounds and buildings for public libraries; household furniture up to a prescribed value; the farming utensils of any person who makes his livelihood by farming; and many other kinds of property. The section opens with the statement that 'the following classes of property are not to be taxed,' and then enumerates the classes. But the scope of the exemption is likely to be exaggerated unless the next preceding section (1303) is read at the same time. 'The board of supervisors of each county shall, annually, at its September session, levy the following taxes upon the assessed value of the taxable property in the county,' a mandate clearly addressed to the levy of ad valorem taxes only. The inference is a fair one that section 1304 did not exempt the items there enumerated from taxation of every form and for every purpose. It withdrew them from the operation of the levy commanded by the section next preceding. \n5\n True, in later compilations of the statutes, the sections have been rearranged, though with substance unaffected. Cf. Code 1935,  6953. In the Code of 1935, subdivision 1 of section 1304 is subdivision 5 of section 6944; section 1303 is section 7171. There can be little doubt that the meaning remains what it was before. United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729, 740\n, 4 S.Ct. 196; United States v.

Davis, 75 N.Y. 221, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n 225, 226; Fifth Avenue Bldg. Co. v. Kernochan, 221 N.Y. 370, 375, 117 N.E. 579; Mitchell v. Simpson, L.R. 25 Q.B.D. 183, 189.\n Besides the school and county bonds, appellants were the owners of a Soldiers' Bonus bond in the sum of $1,000, and Road bonds or certificates to the amount of $82,000. The exemption of the Bonus bond was declared by the statute authorizing the issue. Acts 39th G.A. c. 332,  10, adopted March 23, 1921. The exemption is now subdivision 22 of section 6944 3f the Code of 1935, and should be given the same meaning as the exemption conferred by the other subdivisions. The Road bonds or certificates have their exemption under a different statute (section 4753-a13, Codes of 1931 and 1935), but the bonds are expressly declared to be obligations of the county (section 4753-a14), and, as the court below observed, there is no reason to suppose that the exemption given them was broader than that of county obligations generally.\n\n 2. \nThe meaning of the Iowa statutes is clarified, if otherwise uncertain, by the opinions of the Iowa court in this and other cases.\n The court in its opinion in this case applied the general principle that contracts of tax exemption must receive a strict construction. The teaching of this court has been always to the same effect. 'Grants of immunity from taxation, in derogation of a sovereign power of the state, are strictly construed.' Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 491\n, 52 S. Ct. 424, 426, citing many cases. Adhering to that principle, the Iowa court held that the tax exemption was limited to taxes upon property, and could not be extended to taxes in the nature of an excise. For this restriction it found support in its own earlier decisions, rendered many years before appellants' bonds were purchased. Thus, Sioux City v. Independent School District, 55 Iowa 150, 7 N.W. 488, decided in 1880, and Edwards & Walsh Construction Co. v. Jasper County, 117 Iowa 365, 90 N.W. 1006, 1011, 94 Am.St.Rep. 301, de- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n cided in 1902, held the exemption inapplicable to special assessments, limiting it at the same time 'to the taxes contemplated in title 6 of the Code.' \n6\n So also Insurance Ass'n v. Gilbertson, 129 Iowa 658, 106 N.W. 153, decided in 1906, interpreting a different subdivision of the exemption statute, but a cognate one, again limited the exemption to taxes upon property, and refused to apply it to an excise or license tax measured by receipts. The ruling was reiterated in State v. City of Des Moines, 221 Iowa 642, 266 N.W. 41, decided in 1936, upon facts not greatly different. Cf. Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S.Ct. 829. From these precedents the Iowa court advanced to the holding, announced in the case at bar, that a tax upon net income was substantially an excise, and hence did not come within the scope of an exemption confined to taxes upon property. The result was conceived to be latent in the precedents if effect was to be given to their fair implications. 'So the state court has told us,' construing its own decisions, 'and the good faith of its declaration is not successfully impeached.' Stockholders of Peoples Banking Co. v. Sterling, \n300 \nU.S. 175, 183\n, 57 S.Ct. 386, 390.\n\n 3. \nThe ruling that a tax upon net income is without the scope of the exemption cannot be adjudged unreasonable, for it will be found to be supported by decisions in many other states, and even, indeed, by decisions of this court.\n\n\n (a)\n The question as to the nature of such a tax has come up repeatedly under state constitutions requiring taxes upon property to be equal and uniform, or imposing similar restrictions. Many, perhaps most, courts hold that a net income tax is to be classified as an excise. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 105]\n\u00a0\n 'The tax levied on income is not a property tax, but is a percentage laid on the amount which a man receives, irrespective of whether he spends it, wastes it, or invests it.' Featherstone v. Norman, 170 Ga. 370, 382, 153 S. E. 58, 65, 70 A.L.R. 449; Purnell v. Page, 133 N.C. 125, 129, 45 S.E. 534. As early as 1870, the Supreme Court of Iowa had written an opinion which foreshadows the same thought. Dubuque v. Northwestern Life Ins. Co., 29 Iowa 9. Cf. Vilas v. Iowa State Board of Assessment and Review (Iowa) 273 N.W. 338. True, there are courts in other states that teach a different doctrine. \n8\n Our duty does not call upon us to determine which view we would accept as supported by the better reason if the choice were an original one for us, unaffected by the view accepted in the court below. Enough for present purposes that with authority so nearly balanced the Iowa construction of the contract is at least not plainly wrong. The propriety of our keeping to it is the clearer when we bear in mind that there were Iowa \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 106]\n\u00a0\n decisions pointing the same way before appellants became owners.\n\n\n (b)\n Finally, and even more conclusively, decisions of our own court forbid us to stigmatize as unreasonable the classification of a tax upon net income as something different from a property tax, if not substantially an excise. People ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist, \n262 \nU.S. 94\n, 43 S.Ct. 501; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 108 A.L.R. 821; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1\n, 36 S.Ct. 236, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 713, all point in that direction. We will consider them in the order stated.\n The taxpayer in People ex rel. Clyde v. Gilchrist claimed the benefit of an exemption under a statute of New York to the effect that, upon payment of a recording tax, debts and obligations secured by mortgages of real property should be exempt from other taxation by the state and local subdivisions. The question was whether the exemption thus accorded was applicable to an income tax enacted long afterwards. The state court ruled against the taxpayer (People ex rel. Central Union Trust Co. v. Wendell, 197 App.Div. 131, 188 N.Y.S. 344; People ex rel. Clyde v. Wendell, 197 App. Div. 913, 187 N.Y.S.. 949; Id., 232 N.Y. 550, 134 N.E. 567), assuming the existence of a contract of exemption, but holding that it was not intended to apply to taxes upon income. This court, considering the fact that at the date of the exemption statute 'no one thought of an income tax,' and recalling that 'any contract of exemption must be shown to have been indisputably within the intention of the Legislature,' sustained the judgment of the state court. 'The conclusion does not seem to us very difficult to reach.' \n262 \nU.S. 94\n, at page 98, 43 S.Ct. 501, 503.\n The controversy in New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, decided at the last term, evoked a ruling by this court that a state tax upon net income which included rents derived from land in another state was not equivalent to a property tax imposed upon the land itself. 'The inci- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 107]\n\u00a0\n dence of a tax on income differs from that of a tax on property. Neither tax is dependent upon the possession by the taxpayer of the subject of the other. His income may be taxed, although he owns no property, and his property may be taxed, although it produces no income.' \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, at page 314, 57 S.Ct. 466, 468, 108 A.L.R. 721. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S.Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S.Ct. 912, was considered and distinguished. Two rulings emerge as a result of the analysis. By the teaching of the Pollock Case an income tax on the rents of land (\n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S.Ct. 673) or even on the fruits of other investments (\n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S.Ct. 912) is an impost upon property within the section of the Constitution (article 1,  2, cl. 3) governing the apportionment of direct taxes among the states. \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, at page 315, 57 S.Ct. 466, 468, 108 A.L.R. 721. By the teaching of the same case an income tax, if made to cover the interest on government bonds, is a clog upon the borrowing power such as was condemned in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, and Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, at pages 315, 316, 57 S.Ct. 466, 468, 469, 108 A.L.R. 821. There was no holding that the tax is a property one for every purpose or in every context. We look to all the facts.\n In line with that conception of the Pollock Case is Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., supra, where the court pointed out (\n240 \nU.S. 1\n, at pages 16, 17, 36 S.Ct. 236, 241, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 713) that 'the conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property,' but that to the contrary such taxes were enforceable as excises except to the extent that violence might thus be done to the spirit and intent of the rule governing apportionment.\n The doctrine of these decisions, we think, is applicable here. We do not overlook the argument that the promise to pay interest may be part of the obligation of a contract as much as the promise to pay principal. To concede this counts for little if the distinction between an \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 108]\n\u00a0\n excise and a property tax, or between the different meanings of a property tax, is not permitted to escape us. Unless the foregoing analysis is faulty, the tax complained of by appellants is not laid upon the obligation to pay the principal or interest created by the bonds, at all events within the meaning of the contract of exemption. The tax is laid upon the net results of a bondle or aggregate of occupations and investments. Under a statute so conceived and framed a man may own a quantity of state and county bonds and pay no tax whatever. The returns from his occupation and investments are thrown into a pot, and, after deducting payments for debts and expenses as well as other items, the amount of the net yield is the base on which his tax will be assessed. Cf. United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 329\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748. In the light of all the precedents brought together in this opinion, we cannot say that a tax assessed on such a base is a plain violation of any contract of exemption to be discovered in the laws of Iowa.\n Doubtless a contract of exemption can be phrased in such terms as to forbid the imposition of a net income tax or indeed a tax of any sort. Bonds issued by the government of the United States are sometimes exempt by their express terms from income taxes to any degree (40 Stat. 35,  1 ( 31 U.S.C.A.  746)), sometimes from income taxes other than surtaxes or excess profits taxes. 40 Stat. 288, 291,  7 (31 U.S.C.A.  747). Such were the Liberty bonds considered by this court in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620\n, 49 S.Ct. 432, 65 A.L.R. 866. Broad also was the exemption given to the Federal Farm Loan bonds considered in the same case, at least in respect of taxes levied by the states, for the bonds were declared expressly to be federal instrumentalities. 39 Stat. 360, 380,  26 (12 U.S.C.A.  931). Less clear and comprehensive was the exemption of the Massachusetts bonds declared by a Massachusetts statute (Mass.G.L. chap. 59,  5) and dealt with more or less summarily at the end of the opinion 279 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 109]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 620, at page 634, 49 S.Ct. 432, 436, 65 A.L.R. 866. However, the courts of Massachusetts had already rejected the contention that an income tax was to be classified as an excise rather than a tax on property. In re Opinion of the Justices, 220 Mass. 613, 624, 108 N.E. 570; Id., 266 Mass. 583, 585, 165 N.E. 900; Harrison v. Commissioner of Corporations, 272 Mass. 422, 427, 172 N.E. 605, 71 A.L.R. 677. The meaning of the exemption was properly ascertained in subjection to that ruling. Cf. Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226; and Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra.\n Nothing in this opinion is at war with Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, or other cases declaring the immunities of governmental agencies. In the case cited and its congeners the problem for decision was whether a tax upon income, even though not a property tax in strictness or for every purpose, was one in such a sense or in such a measure as to hamper the freedom of the central government through the interference of the states or the freedom of the states through the interference of the central government. The limitations declared in those decisions were gathered by implication from the structure of our federal system, and were accommodated, as the court believed, to the public policy at stake. What the court is now concerned with, however, is not the preservation or protection of any governmental function. Iowa cannot be held to cripple in an unconstitutional way her own privileges and powers when she levies an income or even a property tax upon bonds issued by herself. The court is now concerned with the meaning and effect of particular contracts of exemption to be read narrowly and strictly. There is no room at such a time for the freer and broader methods that have been thought to be appropriate in the development of the doctrine of implied restraints.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n At the time the bonds here involved were purchased, the statutes of Iowa expressly provided that they 'are not to be taxed' or 'shall not be taxed' or 'shall be exempt from taxation.' These are plain words, and there is no room for construction. When the language is clear, it is conclusive. 'There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.' This has been held so often by this court that it has become axiomatic. That the provisions with respect to the nontaxability of the bonds constitute a statutory contract with the purchaser of the bonds, and that any subsequent statute which violates these provisions impairs the obligation of the contract, is not a matter of dispute. The sole question is whether the imposition of an income tax in respect of the interest derived from the bonds is a tax upon the bonds.\n We are not concerned with the name given to the tax. The exemption is in unqualified terms, and includes all taxes. And I see no warrant for saying that the exemption must be limited to so-called ad valorem taxes. The exemption is not in the form or nature of a proviso to the section fixing the time and providing for the levy of such taxes, but is a substantive enactment standing independently and complete in itself. Nor do I see any ground for confining it to taxes then known to the Iowa law. Such an all-embracing exemption cannot be avoided by the invention of a new tax. To me, it seems evident that, if any tax be imposed upon the bonds, the contract is impaired. It likewise seems evident that the tax here is imposed on the bonds themselves.\n Of what does a bond for the payment of money consist? Certainly not the principal alone; for the promise to pay interest is as much a part of the obligation of the bond as the promise to pay the principal. A bond, for example, promises to pay the bearer at the end of ten years the sum of $ 1,000, and also interest at the rate of 5% per \n\n[302 \nU.S. 95, 111]\n\u00a0\n annum, to be paid semiannually; that is to say, promises to pay $25 at the end of every six-month period, and $1,000 at the end of ten years. There is no difference between the two promises in respect of their binding or legal quality. Both are obligations of the bond. If one cannot be violated, neither can the other.\n There is no difference in principle between such a bond and one where the bond is issued upon a discount basis, as in the case of United States Savings bonds (Treasury Department Circular No. 529, February 25, 1935). A United States Savings bond for $1,000, payable in ten years 'without interest,' may be purchased for the sum of $750-the remaining $250 being deferred interest. Plainly, the $250 deferred interest is as much a part of the bond as the $750 originally invested; and a contractual obligation exempting the bond from taxation is equally applicable to each. Is the case different if the bond shall provide for the payment of $750, together with interest in the sum of $250 to be paid in installments or at the end of ten years? Certainly not, unless form is to be exalted and substance ignored.\n The force of what has been said cannot be avoided by merely calling the tax an excise. If a tax falls upon the bond and lessens its proceeds, either in respect of principal or interest, it is a tax on the bond, and cannot be made something else by resort to the vocabulary or by employing some circuitous method of imposing it. It is well settled, at least generally, that 'what cannot be done directly ... cannot be accomplished indirectly by legislation which accomplishes the same result.' Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 300 S., 21 S.Ct. 648, 653, and cases cited. I am unable to subscribe to that philosophy which seems to teach that a forbidden result may nevertheless be achieved if only some delusive and devious way of achieving it can be found.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The following classes of property are not to be taxed: 1.

HARRISON(1937)\nNo. 355\nArgued: February 2, 1937Decided: May 24, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Marion Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n Mr. B. D. Murphy, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company, a stock corporation organized under the laws of Connecticut carrying on casualty insurance business in Georgia, and its salaried employee W. M. Francis, citizen of that State, asked the Superior Court, Fulton County, for a mandamus requiring the Insurance Commission to license him as resident agent. The Commissioner claimed that while duly qualified in all other respects, the employee could not be so licensed because of the inhibition in section 1, Act of the General Assembly, approved March 28, 1935. Georgia Laws, 1935, p. 140:\n'No licensed fire or casualty insurance company or company writing fidelity or surety bonds, shall write or issue any policy or indemnity contract on any risk in this State except through a resident agent licensed by the Insurance Commissioner: Provided ... The words 'resident agent' as used in this section are deemed to mean resident agents engaged in the solicitation of such business from the public generally and shall not include any salaried employee of any insurance company doing business in this State; but shall include any agents of mutual insurance companies however compensated.'\n\n Appellants claimed that enforcement of the quoted inhibition would deprive them of the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n The trial court ruled 'that said act, in discriminating against stock companies and the agents thereof, and in favor of mutual companies and the agents thereof, sets up an arbitrary classification bearing no reasonable relationship to the subject-matter of the legislation, and is discriminatory, depriving both petitioner, The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company, as an insurance company, and petitioner, W. M. Francis, as an individual, of their constitutional rights.' Accordingly, it directed that mandamus issue.\n In the State Supreme Court counsel agreed that the sole question involved was the constitutionality of the statute. That Court, being of opinion that the act prescribed no undue discrimination and did not otherwise conflict with the Federal Constitution, reversed the trial court. The cause is here by appeal.\n The applicable principle in respect of classification has often been announced. It will suffice to quote a paragraph from Louisville Gas & Electric Company v. Coleman, Auditor, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 38 S., 48 S.Ct. 423, 425:\n'It may be said generally that the equal protection clause means that the rights of all persons must rest upon the same rule under similar circumstances, Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 337\n, 6 S.Ct. 57; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 18 S.Ct. 594, and that it applies to the exercise of all the powers of the state which can affect the individual or his property, including the power of taxation. County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pac. R. Co. (C.C.) 18 F. 385, 388, 399; The Railroad Tax Cases (C.C.) 13 F. 722, 733. It does not, however, forbid classification; and the power of the state to classify for purposes of taxation is of wide range and flexibility provided always that the classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.'

That is to say, mere difference is not enough; the attempted classification 'must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed, and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.' Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 155\n, 17 S.Ct. 255, 257. Discriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional provision. Compare Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 27 S.Ct. 440; Bell's Gap R.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533.'\n\n Despite the broad range of the state's discretion, it has a limit which must be maintained if the constitutional safeguard is not to be overthrown. Discriminations are not to be supported by mere fanciful conjecture. Borden's Company v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 187, 191. They cannot stand as reasonable if they offend the plain standards of common sense. In this instance, the appellant company had been licensed to do business in the state and was entitled to equal protection in conducting that business. The answer of the insurance commissioner admitted that he was 'entirely satisfied as to the character, standing, responsibility, ability, and knowledge' of the proposed agent, and that the license was refused solely because he was a 'salaried' employee. It is plain that the requirement that the resident agents of stock companies should not work on a salary has no relation to economy or efficiency in management. The answer of the insurance commissioner states that all of the contracts of mutual fire and casualty insurance companies are 'negotiated by salaried employees' and that this method of doing busi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n ness was adopted 'in order to reduce the expenses of operation and thus benefit the policyholders themselves.'\n It is idle to elaborate the differences between mutual and stock companies. These are manifest and admitted. But the statutory discrimination has no reasonable relation to these differences. We can discover no reasonable basis for permitting mutual insurance companies to act through salaried resident employees and exclude stock companies from the same privilege. If there were any such basis, it would have been discovered by the state courts. The trial court said there was none. Two Justices of the Supreme Court were of the same opinion. The prevailing opinion in that court fails to disclose any good reason for the discrimination. The diligence of counsel for appellee has not been more successful. Thus the efforts in the state courts, and here, to find support for the statute have conspicuously failed. Statements as to the extent of the business written by stock companies are obviously beside the mark.\n For the error indicated, the questioned judgment must be reversed and the cause returned to the Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, dissenting.\n The appellants petitioned the superior court of Fulton county, Georgia, for a mandamus directed to the appellee as Insurance Commissioner requiring him to issue a license to Francis, a salaried employe of the Hartford Company, as an insurance agent for the writing of casualty insurance in the State of Georgia pursuant to the Act of the General Assembly of March 28, 1935. The petition alleged that Francis possessed all the statutory qualifications for a license save only that he was a salaried employe of the insurance company and that the pro- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n vision of the statute excluding salaried employes of insurance companies from licensure is unconstitutional.\n Section 1 of the act of 19351 prohibits licensed fire or casualty insurance companies from writing or issuing any policy or indemnity contract on any risk in the State of Georgia except through a resident agent licensed by the Insurance Commissioner. The section requires the applicant for a license to be a bona fide resident of the state, of good character and competent to perform the duties of an agent. It further provides: 'The words 'resident agent' as used in this section are deemed to mean resident agents engaged in the solicitation of such business from the public generally and shall not include any salaried employee of any insurance company doing business in this State; but shall include any agents of mutual insurance companies however compensated.'\n The ground upon which the act is held invalid is that it unreasonably discriminates between salaries employes of mutual insurance companies and similar employes of stock companies.\n The answer alleges that there is a wellrecognized difference between stock and mutual insurance companies in that, in the case of the former, the relationship between the company and its policy-holders is one of contract merely, they dealing at arm's length, whereas in the latter the policy-holders are the owners of the company and constitute its membership. Other well known differences between mutual and stock insurance are detailed in the answer and will be referred to hereinafter.\n The case was heard upon the petition and answer and the trial court, in the view that the act was unconstitutional, ordered that a mandamus issue. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Georgia reversed the judgment. I \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n am of the opinion that its decision was right and should be affirmed.\n First. On its face the statute is a proper exercise of the state's police power. The provision for licensing only bona fide residents of the state is valid. \n2\n Regulation of the rates charged for insurance, of the relations of those engaged in the business and of the amount of agents' compensation fall within the exercise of this power. \n3\n The claim here is that the particular regulation is unreasonable and discriminatory. The presumption of constitutional validity must prevail unless the terms of the statute, or what we judicially know, or facts proved by the appellants, overthrow that presumption. As it is conceivable that conditions existed in Georgia which justified the difference in treatment of the agents of the two sorts of companies, and as no circumstances are alleged or proved or are of judicial knowledge which negative the existence of those conditions, the attack upon the statute should fail. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The appellant Francis asserts he is denied equal protection because agents of mutual insurance companies may be licensed even though their compensation consists of a salary rather than commissions. The answer sets up that mutual insurance companies are organized on a different basis from stock companies, do business in a wholly different way and sustain an altogether different relation to their policy-holders than do stock companies. This is matter of common knowledge. Section 56- 1401 of the Georgia Code 1933 is: 'The contract of insurance is sometimes upon the idea of mu- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n tuality, by which each of the insured becomes one of the insurers, thereby becoming interested in the profits and liable for the losses; without a charter, such an organization would be governed by the general law of partnership; when incorporated, they are subject to the terms of their charters.' Sections 56-1401 to 56-1433 deal exclusively with the incorporation and government of mutual insurance companies setting up for them a system quite apart from that prescribed for the incorporation and regulation of stock companies. The decision law of the state also recognizes the fundamental different between the two kinds of company. 5 The Supreme Court of Georgia quoted and relied upon its earlier decision as to the radical difference between stock and mutual companies and their methods of transacting business, and refused to hold the classification of the statute arbitrary or unreasonable.\n The literature on the subject shows that at its inception the fire insurance business in the United States was modelled upon the mutual companies of Great Britain. \n6\n Stock companies, however, were soon organized and rapidly grew to such proportions that today they transact about seventh-five per cent. of the nation's fire insurance business. Local and state mutual insurance companies now write about 10 per cent. of the total of fire insurance and are strongest in agricultural districts and the smaller cities; another 10 per cent. of the total business is written by so-called factory mutuals; the balance is cared for by Lloyd's associations. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The principle of assessment upon which mutual companies proceed is practical only for carrying risks closely uniform in kind and degree its chief advantage being \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 467]\n\u00a0\n low operating cost due to simplicity of organization and it is said that the sales staffs of such companies work either 'on a salaried basis or on a lower scale of commissions than do the representatives of stock companies.' 8 There are approximately twenty-five hundred mutual fire and casualty institutions operating throughout the United States the vast majority of which concentrate their operations locally within one or more counties or within a single state. 'These companies rarely compete with agency represented stock companies and there has been no apparent inclination on their part to alter the scope of activity or plan of operation. Of the many mutual fire insurance companies probably no more than ten per cent extend their fields of operation beyond the boundaries of their home state.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Reference to the report of the Insurance Commissioner of Georgia for 1934, the year preceding the adoption of the statute under review, furnishes interesting data on the relative business of stock and mutual insurance companies in the State of Georgia. For that year the total of risks carried by stock fire insurance companies in the state was $1,512, 181,296. Foreign mutual fire insurance companies carried onl $82,727,816. Two domestic mutual companies doing a state-wide business carried $73,370, 177, and fourteen small local mutuals carried $10,893,603. Thus, mutual companies carried about 10 per cent. of the total fire insurance business of the state and, of that 10 per cent., over one-half was written by Georgia mutual companies.\n While Georgia does not exclude foreign mutuals and requires them, like foreign stock companies, to register and comply with certain statutory rules in order to write business within the state, it is evident that the total mutual business written in Georgia is of minor importance \n\n[301 \nU.S. 459, 468]\n\u00a0\n when compared with the vast amount written by stock companies. This fact in itself may well be a persuasive reason for not extending to agents of mutual companies the requirement that they shall not work upon a salary. \n10\n When to this is added the fact that ordinarily such agents work on salary because, in effect, they are the agents of the policyholders rather than of independent owners of a stock corporation, it is plain that there is reason for classifying them differently from agents of stock companies. In the light of the facts the classification of the agents of the two sorts of company cannot be said to be arbitray or unreasonable, and so to deny the agents of the stock companies the equal protection of the laws.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 28, 1935.

CITY OF CHICAGO(1937)\nNo. 175\nArgued: December 11, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois. \n\n[299 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Owen Rall and Irwin T. Gilruth, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Martin H. Foss, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, while residing at Morris, Ill., engaged in trucking coal for hire from a mine near that place 62 miles over public roads to Chicago where he delivered it to consumers. He both owned and drove the truck.\n Smith-Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 24,  65.53, 65.54, 65.55, 65.90, Revised Statutes of Illinois (1935) c. 24, art. 5,  65(54), 65(55), 65(56), 65( 91), give cities power to regulate inspection, weighing, and measuring of coal, inspection and sealing of weights, measures, etc. Chapter 147 Smith- Hurd Ill.Stats. c. 147,  1 et seq.) provides for inspecting and sealing scales by state officers; but no law permits designation of state weighmasters.\n Chicago by ordinance has authorized the appointment of weighmasters and prescribed their duties. Rev.Code (1931)  525, 526, 2939, 2947, 2950, 3612, 3623\n\n\n Section 29471 requires that merchandise 'sold in load \n\n[299 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n lots by weight, delivered by wagon, truck or other vehicle within the city, shall be weighed by a public weighmaster' and that his certificate showing weights shall be delivered to the purchaser or consignee. Section 3612 permits appointment, as weighmaster, of any one owning scales under prescribed conditions; and section 36212 fixes permissible charges. Section 36233 directs: 'In no case shall any public weighmaster state in his certificate the tare weight \n\n[299 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n of any vehicle until after he shall have weighed the vehicle in such manner as to secure the weight as specified herein. ...'\n The Chicago municipal court adjudged appellant guilty of violating section 2947 by delivering coal trucked directly from the mine at Morris to a consumer in Chicago without having obtained a weighmaster's certificate showing the gross, tare, and net weights. The coal had been weighed at the mine upon scales duly tested by the state. He claimed the ordinance, as applied to his business, unreasonably required rehandling of coal already properly weighed and therefore offened the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment of conviction. It upheld the view that under sections 2947 and 3623 coal brought by truck directly from the mine to the consumer in Chicago, although weighed at the mine on state tested scales, must be unloaded within the city, in order to permit a public weighmaster there to weigh the \n\n[299 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n empty truck, and then reloaded so that both truck and load may be weighed by the same official. The prescribed certificate can issue only after such double weighing.\n The Court declared that so construed the ordinance did not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment and that ruling is the basis for the only question presented for our determination. Violation of the ordinance as written is admitted. Also that it is not unreasonable as applied to dealers operating coal yards within Chicago.\n Counsel maintain that appellant's business differs materially from the business of those who operate local coal yards; that the questioned ordinance is unreasonable in requiring coal weighed upon state inspected scales to be unloaded and reweighed before delivery, since weights could be adequately verified by practical methods not involving this expensive and burdensome proceeding; also that the ordinance unduly discriminates between those who truck coal directly from the mine and dealers with yards within the city.\n In City of Chicago v. Wisconsin Lime Co. (1924) 312 Ill. 520, 144 N.E. 3, the Supreme Court affirmed the power of Chicago to enact the challenged ordinance and pointed out that it 'was designed to protect the purchasing public against what has been universally regarded as a widespread evil in the selling of commodities in load lots by weight, and it contained effective means for the prevention of the evil.'\n Below, that Court said: 'The opportunity to defraud the consumer in the sale of coal in load lots is great and the consumer has no adequate way to protect himself against being cheated. The delivery of true weights of coal to the consumer is a matter clearly related to the public welfare, and the city has the right to adopt reasonable ordinances therefor. ... The defendants, nonresidents of the city of Chicago, are asking for a practice of weighing, as applied to the business done by them in the \n\n[299 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n city, which under the ordinance here would not apply to those truckers living in the city and delivering coal from the local yards or local dealers in the city to the consumer. ... Where a city has enacted an ordinance within its charter or granted powers regulating a business, the nonresidents who desire to follow such business within such municipality must conform to the requirements of the ordinance.'\n For many years, by admission, Chicago has rightly required local truckmen to comply with the ordinance. Since the evil to be prevented is no less imminent when coal comes by truck from without the city, a like requirement as to this seems equally important. The ordinance makes no discrimination of which appellant can complain; and no adequate reason has been suggested for concluding that although valid as to local truckers it violates rights guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n That the coal delivered by appellant was weighed at the mine on tested scales is stressed; but this is not really material. Chicago had no control there and such weighing afforded no adequate protection against fraud. The opportunities for manipulation thereafter are obvious. Invalidity of the ordinance cannot be established by suggesting some other less burdensome procedure, which possibly might accomplish the end in view- honest delivery weights. The city may act with proper legislative discretion. Here there is nothing to show action so arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory as to require us to overthrow its deliberate effort to meet a plain evil. Rast v.

When delivery is made, in case no person is present to receive such commodity, produce or other article or articles of merchandise, and if the purchaser or consignee, or his or their agent, cannot be located, then the memorandum or certificate of weight hereinbefore provided for shall be posted conspicuously at the place of delivery before any of the commodity, produce or other article or articles of merchandise is removed from the vehicle.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3621:\n'Public weighmasters, when not the owners or sellers of the articles, commodities or produce weighed by them, shall be entitled to charge and receive a sum not in excess of twenty-five cents for each and every load or part of load (or lesser quantity when not contained in any wagon, truck or other vehicle), of any commodity, produce, article or articles of merchandise weighed by them over the scales of such public weighmasters.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 3623:\n'Each public weighmaster shall issue a weight certificate, signed by him or his deputy, under his official seal, which certificate shall state thereon the following: The commodity, produce, article or articles weighed; the date; the name of the weighmaster or deputy weighmaster who did the weighing; the name and address of the person, firm or corporation for whom the weighing was done; the name of the driver of the vehicle bringing such commodity, produce, article or articles to the scales, or, if the same is not contained in a vehicle, the name and address of the person bringing the same to the scales; where contained in a vehicle, the kind of vehicle and the name and address of the purchaser or consignee of the commodity weighed; when the commodity is loaded in a vehicle, the total or gross weight of the commodity weighed and the conveyance in which it is loaded, together with the driver and any other person who may be on the vehicle when weighed, and of the horses, if a horse-drawn vehicle and the horses are weighed; the tare weight or the weight of the vehicle, including driver and any other person who may have been on the vehicle when weighed while loading and including the horses if they were weighed when the loaded vehicle was weighed; the net weight of the commodity, produce, article or articles contained in such vehicle, or the net weight of the commodity, produce, article or articles when not contained in a vehicle at the time of weighing. In no case shall any public weighmaster state in his certificate the tare weight of any vehicle until after he shall have weighed the vehicle in such manner as to secure the weight as specified herein; provided, however, that in the case of a divided load, by which is meant a load containing more than one order for the same or different purchasers or consignees, no penalty shall be imposed under this chapter by reason of the fact that the tare weight shown on the weight certificates is only the original tare weight of the vehicle and equipment before loading if in such case each order has been weighed separately and the net weight of each separate order or delivery is correctly shown on the weight certificate and such correct net weight is delivered.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

(42 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq.), is challenged once again.\n In Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed . --, decided this day, we have upheld the validity of Title IX of the act ( section 901 et seq. (42 U.S.C.A.  1101 et seq.)), imposing an excise upon employers of eight or more. In this case Titles VIII and II (sections 801 et seq., 201 et seq. (42 U.S.C.A.  1001 et seq., 401 et seq.)) are the subject of attack. Title VIII lays another excise upon employers in addition to the one imposed by Title IX (though with different exemptions). It lays a special income tax upon employees to be deducted from their wages and paid by the employers. Title II provides for the payment of Old Age Benefits, and supplies the motive and occasion, in the view of the assailants of the statute, for \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 635]\n\u00a0\n the levy of the taxes imposed by Title VIII. The plan of the two titles will now be summarized more fully.\n Title VIII, as we have said, lays two different types of tax, an 'income tax on employees,' and 'an excise tax on employers.' The income tax on employees is measured by wages paid during the calendar year. Section 801 (42 U.S.C.A.  1001). The excise tax on the employer is to be paid 'with respect to having individuals in his employ,' and, like the tax on employees, is measured by wages. Section 804 (42 U.S.C.A.  1004). Neither tax is applicable to certain types of employment, such as agricultural labor, domestic service, service for the national or state governments, and service performed by persons who have attained the age of 65 years. Section 811(b), 42 U.S.C.A.  1011(b). The two taxes are at the same rate. Sections 801, 804 (42 U.S.C.A.  1001, 1004). For the years 1937 to 1939, inclusive, the rate for each tax is fixed at one per cent. Thereafter the rate increases 1\/2 of 1 per cent. every three years, until after December 31, 1948, the rate for each tax reaches 3 per cent. Ibid. In the computation of wages all remuneration is to be included except so much as is in excess of $3,000 during the calendar year affected. Section 811(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1011(a). The income tax on employees is to be collected by the employer, who is to deduct the amount from the wages 'as and when paid.' Section 802(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1002(a). He is indemnified against claims and demands of any person by reason of such payment. Ibid. The proceeds of both taxes are to be paid into the Treasury like internal revenue taxes generally, and are not ear-marked in any way. Section 807(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  1007(a). There are penalties for nonpayment. Section 807(c), 42 U.S.C.A.  1007(c).\n Title II (section 201 et seq. (42 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq.)) has the caption 'Federal Old-Age Benefits.' The benefits are of two types, first, monthly pensions, and second, lump-sum payments, the payments of the second class being relatively few and unimportant.\n The first section of this title creates an account in the United States Treasury to be known as the 'Old-Age \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 636]\n\u00a0\n Reserve Account.' Section 201 (42 U.S.C.A.  401). No present appropriation, however, is made to that account. All that the statute does is to authorize appropriations annually thereafter, beginning with the fiscal year which ends June 30, 1937. How large they shall be is not known in advance. The 'amount sufficient as an annual premium' to provide for the required payments is 'to be determined on a reserve basis in accordance with accepted actuarial principles, and based upon such tables of mortality as the Secretary of the Treasury shall from time to time adopt, and upon an interest rate of 3 per centum per annum compounded annually.' Section 201(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  401(a). Not a dollar goes into the Account by force of the challenged act alone, unaided by acts to follow.\n Section 202 and later sections (42 U.S.C.A.  402 et seq.) prescribed the form of benefits. The principal type is a monthly pension payable to a person after he has attained the age of 65. This benefit is available only to one who has worked for at least one day in each of at least five separate years since December 31, 1936, who has earned at least $2,000 since that date, and who is not then receiving wages 'with respect to regular employment.' Sections 202(a), (d), 210(c), 42 U.S.C.A.  402(a, d ), 410(c). The benefits are not to begin before January 1, 1942. Section 202(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  402(a). In no event are they to exceed $85 a month. Section 202(b), 42 U.S.C.A.  402(b). They are to be measured (subject to that limit) by a percentage of the wages, the percentage decreasing at stated intervals as the wages become higher. Section 202(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  402(a). In addition to the monthly benefits, provision is made in certain contingencies for 'lump sum payments' of secondary importance. A summary by the Government of the four situations calling for such payments is printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 637]\n\u00a0\n This suit is brought by a shareholder of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston, a Massachusetts corporation, to restrain the corporation from making payments and deductions called for by the act, which is stated to be void under the Constitution of the United States. The bill tells us that the corporation has decided to obey the statute, that it has reached this decision in the face of the complainant's protests, and that it will make the payments and deductions unless restrained by a decree. The expected consequences are indicated substantially as follows: The deductions from the wages of the employees will produce unrest among them, and will be followed, it is predicted, by demands that wages be increased. If the exactions shall ultimately be held void, the company will have parted with moneys which as a practical matter it will be impossible to recover. Nothing is said in the bill about the promise of indemnity. The prediction is made also that serious consequences will en- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 638]\n\u00a0\n sue if there is a submission to the excise. The corporation and its shareholders will suffer irreparable loss, and many thousands of dollars will be subtracted from the value of the shares. The prayer is for an injunction and for a declaration that the act is void.\n The corporation appeared and answered without raising any issue of fact. Later the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the United States Collector for the District of Massachusetts, petitioners in this court, were allowed to intervene. They moved to strike so much of the bill as has relation to the tax on employees, taking the ground that the employer, not being subject to tax under those provisions, may not challenge their validity, and that the complainant shareholder, whose rights are no greater than those of his corporation, has even less standing to be heard on such a question. The intervening defendants also filed an answer which restated the point raised in the motion to strike, and maintained the validity of Title VIII in all its parts. The District Court held that the tax upon employees was not properly at issue, and that the tax upon employers was constitutional. It thereupon denied the prayer for an injunction, and dismissed the bill. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the decree was reversed, one judge dissenting. Davis v. Edison Electric Illuminating Co., 89 F.(2d) 393. The court held that Title II was void as an invasion of powers reserved by the Tenth Amendment to the states or to the people, and that Title II in collapsing carried Title VIII along with it. As an additional reason for invalidating the tax upon employers, the court held that it was not an excise as excises were understood when the Constitution was adopted. Cf. Davis v. Boston & Maine R. Co. (C.C.A.) 89 F.(2d) 368, decided the same day.\n A petition for certiorari followed. It was filed by the intervening defendants, the Commissioner, and the Collector, and brought two questions, and two only, to our \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 639]\n\u00a0\n notice. We were asked to determine: (1) 'Whether the tax imposed upon employers by section 804 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A.  1004) is within the power of Congress under the Constitution,' and (2) 'Whether the validity of the tax imposed upon employees by section 801 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A.  1001) is properly in issue in this case, and if it is, whether that tax is within the power of Congress under the Constitution.' The defendant corporation gave notice to the clerk that it joined in the petition, but it has taken no part in any subsequent proceedings. A writ of certiorari issued. \n301 \nU.S. 674\n, 57 S.Ct. 792, 81 L. Ed. --.\n First: Questions as to the remedy invoked by the complainant confront us at the outset.\n Was the conduct of the company in resolving to pay the taxes a legitimate exercise of the discretion of the directors? Has petitioner a standing to challenge that resolve in the absence of an adequate showing of irreparable injury? Does the acquiescence of the company in the equitable remedy affect the answer to those questions? Though power may still be ours to take such objections for ourselves, is acquiescence effective to rid us of the duty? Is duty modified still further by the attitude of the Government, its waiver of a defense under section 3224 of the Revised Statutes (26 U.S.C.A.  1543), its waiver of a defense that the legal remedy is adequate, its earnest request that we determine whether the law shall stand or fall? The writer of this opinion believes that the remedy is ill conceived, that in a controversy such as this a court must refuse to give equitable relief when a cause of action in equity is neither pleaded nor proved, and that the suit for an injunction should be dismissed upon that ground. He thinks this course should be followed in adherence to the general rule that constitutional questions are not to be determined in the absence of strict necessity. In that view he is supported by Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS. However, a majority of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 640]\n\u00a0\n court have reached a different conclusion. They find in this case extraordinary features making it fitting in their judgment to determine whether the benefits and the taxes are valid or invalid. They distinguish Norman v. Consolidated Gas Co., 89 F.(2d) 619, recently decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on the ground that in that case, the remedy was challenged by the company and the Government at every stage of the proceeding, thus withdrawing from the court any marginal discretion. The ruling of the majority removes from the case the preliminary objection as to the nature of the remedy which we took of our own motion at the beginning of the argument. Under the compulsion of that ruling, the merits are now here.\n Second: The scheme of benefits created by the provisions of Title II is not in contravention of the limitations of the Tenth Amendment.\n Congress may spend money in aid of the 'general welfare.' Constitution, art. 1,  8; United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1, 65\n, 56 S. Ct. 312, 319, 102 A.L.R. 914. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra. There have been great statesmen in our history who have stood for other views. We will not resurrect the contest. It is now settled by decision. United States v. Butler, supra. The conception of the spending power advocated by Hamilton and strongly reinforced by Story has prevailed over that of Madison, which has not been lacking in adherents. Yet difficulties are left when the power is conceded. The line must still be drawn between one welfare and another, between particular and general. Where this shall be placed cannot be known through a formula in advance of the event. There is a middle ground or certainly a penumbra in which discretion is at large. The discretion, however, is not confided to the courts. The discretion belongs to Congress, unless the choice is clearly wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of judgment. This is now familiar law. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 641]\n\u00a0\n 'When such a contention comes here we naturally require a showing that by no reasonable possibility can the challenged legislation fall within the wide range of discretion permitted to the Congress.' United States v. Butler, supra, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 67, 56 S.Ct. 312, 320, 102 A.L.R. 914. Cf. Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 764, 81 L.Ed. --, May 3, 1937; United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427, 440\n, 16 S.Ct. 1120; Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 595\n, 5 S.Ct. 247. Nor is the concept of the general welfare static. Needs that were narrow or parochial a century ago may be interwoven in our day with the well-being of the nation. What is critical or urgent changes with the times.\n The purge of nation-wide calamity that began in 1929 has taught us many lessons. Not the least is the solidarity of interests that may once have seemed to be divided. Unemployment spreads from state to state, the hinterland now settled that in pioneer days gave an avenue of escape. Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 442\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 241, 88 A.L.R. 1481. Spreading from state to state, unemployment is an ill not particular but general, which may be checked, if Congress so determines, by the resources of the nation. If this can have been doubtful until now, our ruling today in the case of the Steward Machine Co., supra, has set the doubt at rest. But the ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it. Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause. The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near.\n Congress did not improvise a judgment when it found that the award of old age benefits would be conducive to the general welfare. The President's Committee on Economic Security made an investigation and report, aided by a research staff of Government officers and employees, and by an Advisory Council and seven other advisory \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 642]\n\u00a0\n groups. \n2\n Extensive hearings followed before the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance. \n3\n A great mass of evidence was brought together supporting the policy which finds expression in the act. Among the relevant facts are these: The number of persons in the United States 65 years of age or over is increasing proportionately as well as absolutely. What is even more important the number of such persons unable to take care of themselves is growing at a threatening pace. More and more our population is becoming urban and industrial instead of rural and agricultural. \n4\n The evidence is impressive that among industrial workers the younger men and women are preferred over the older. \n5\n In times of retrenchment the older are commonly the first to go, and even if retained, their wages are likely to be lowered. The plight of men and women at so low an age as 40 is hard, almost hopeless, when they are driven to seek for reemployment. Statistics are in the brief. A few illustrations will be chosen from many there collected. In 1930, out of 224 American factories investigated, 71, or almost one third, had fixed maximum hiring age limits; in 4 plants the limit was under 40; in 41 it was under 46. In the other 153 plants there were no fixed limits, but in practice few were hired if they were over 50 years of age. \n6\n With the loss of savings inevitable in periods of idleness, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 643]\n\u00a0\n the fate of workers over 65, when thrown out of work, is little less than desperate. A recent study of the Social Security Board informs us that 'one-fifth of the aged in the United States were receiving old-age assistance, emergency relief, institutional care, employment under the works program, or some other form of aid from public or private funds; two- fifths to one-half were dependent on friends and relatives, one-eighth had some income from earnings; and possibly one-sixth had some savings or property. Approximately three out of four persons 65 or over were probably dependent wholly or partially on others for support.' \n7\n We summarize in the margin the results of other studies by state and national commissions. \n8\n They point the same way. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 644]\n\u00a0\n The problem is plainly national in area and dimensions. Moreover, laws of the separate states cannot deal with it effectively. Congress, at least, had a basis for that belief. States and local governments are often lacking in the resources that are necessary to finance an adequate program of security for the aged. This is brought out with a wealth of illustration in recent studies of the problem. \n9\n Apart from the failure of resources, states and local governments are at times reluctant to increase so heavily the burden of taxation to be borne by their residents for fear of placing themselves in a position of economic disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors. We have seen this in our study of the problem of unemployment compensation. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra. A system of old age pensions has special dangers of its own, if put in force in one state and rejected in another. The existence of such a system is a bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere, encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose. Only a power that is national can serve the interests of all.\n Whether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth in Title II, it is not for us to say. The answer to such inquiries must come from Congress, not the courts. Our concern here as often is with power, not with wisdom. Counsel for respondent has recalled to us the virtues of self-reliance and frugality. There is a possibility, he says, that aid from a paternal government \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 645]\n\u00a0\n may sap those sturdy virtues and breed a race of weaklings. If Massachusetts so believes and shapes her laws in that conviction, must her breed of sons be changed, he asks, because some other philosophy of government finds favor in the halls of Congress? But the answer is not doubtful. One might ask with equal reason whether the system of protective tariffs is to be set aside at will in one state or another whenever local policy prefers the rule of laissez faire. The issue is a closed one. It was fought out long ago. 10\n When money is spent to promote the general welfare, the concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress, not the states. So the concept be not arbitrary, the locality must yield. Constitution, art. 6, par. 2.\n Third: Title II being valid, there is no occasion to inquire whether Title VIII would have to fall if Title II were set at naught.\n The argument for the respondent is that the provisions of the two titles dovetail in such a way as to justify the conclusion that Congress would have been unwilling to pass one without the other. The argument for petitioners is that the tax moneys are not earmarked, and that Congress is at liberty to spend them as it will. The usual separability clause is embodied in the act. Section 1103 (42 U.S.C.A.  1303).\n We find it unnecessary to make a choice between the arguments, and so leave the question open.\n Fourth: The tax upon employers is a valid excise or duty upon the relation of employment.\n As to this we need not add to our opinion in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, where we considered a like question in respect of Title IX. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 619, 646]\n\u00a0\n Fifth: The tax is not invalid as a result of its exemptions.\n Here again the opinion in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, supra, says all that need be said.\n Sixth: The decree of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. Ordered accordingly.\n Decree of Court of Appeals reversed, and decree of District Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the provisions of the Act here challenged are repugnant to the Tenth Amendment, and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] (1) If through an administrative error or delay a person who is receiving a monthly pension dies before he receives the correct amount, the amount which should have been paid to him is paid in a lump sum to his estate (section 203(c) 42 U.S.C.A.  403(c)).\n (2) If a person who has earned wages in each of at least five separate years since December 31, 1936, and who has earned in that period more than $2,000, dies after attaining the age of 65, but before he has received in monthly pensions an amount equal to 3 1\/2 per cent. of the 'wages' paid to him between January 1, 1937, and the time he reaches 65, then there is paid in a lump sum to his estate the difference between said 3 1\/2 per cent. and the total amount paid to him during his life as monthly pensions (section 203(b), 42 U.S.C.A.  403(b)). \n (3) If a person who has earned wages since December 31, 1936, dies before attaining the age of 65, then there is paid to his estate 3 1\/2 per cent. of the 'wages' paid to him between January 1, 1937, and his death ( section 203(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  403(b)).\n (4) If a person has, since December 31, 1936, earned wages in employment covered by Title II, but has attained the age of 65 either without working for at least one day in each of 5 separate years since 1936, or without earning at least $2,000 between January 1, 1937, and the time he attains 65, then there is paid to him (or to his estate, section 204(b), 42 U.S.C.A.  404(b)), a lump sum equal to 3 1\/2 per cent. of the 'wages' paid to him between January 1, 1937, and the time he attained 65 ( section 204(a), 42 U.S.C.A.  404(a)). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Report to the President of the Committee on Economic Security, 1935. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.R. 4120, 74th Congress, 1st session; Hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance on S. 1130, 74th Congress, 1st Session. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Report of the Committee on Recent Social Trends, 1932, vol. 1, pp. 8, 502; Thompson and Whelpton, Population Trends in the United States, pp. 18, 19. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the authorities collected at pp. 54-62 of the Government's brief. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Hiring and Separation Methods in American Industry, 35 Monthly Labor Review, pp. 1005, 1009. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Economic Insecurity in Old Age (Social Security Board, 1937), p. 15. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Senate Committee estimated, when investigating the present act, that over one half of the people in the United States over 65 years of age are dependent upon others for support.

GOWRAN(1937)\nNo. 27\nArgued: October 22, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. John C. Altman, of San Francisco, Cal., and A. L. Nash, of Manitowoc, Wis., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions for decision concern the taxation as income of a dividend in preferred stock and the proceeds received on its sale.\n On June 29, 1929, the Hamilton Manufacturing Company, a Wisconsin corporation, had outstanding preferred stock of the par value of $100 a share and common stock without par value. On that day the directors declared from the surplus earnings a dividend of $14 a share on the common stock, payable on July 1, 1929, in preferred stock at its par value. Gowran, as owner of common stock, received as his dividend 533 and a fraction shares of the preferred. On or about October 1, 1929, the company acquired his preferred stock and paid him therefor, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 240]\n\u00a0\n at $100 a share, $53,371.50. In his income tax return for the year Gowran did not treat this sum as taxable income, but included $27,262.72 as capital net gain on the shares received and sold, computing the gain under articles 58 and 600 of regulations 74, then in force. The Commissioner rejected that treatment of the matter; determined that the $53,371.50 received was income taxable under the Revenue Act of 1928,  115(g), 45 Stat. 791, 822 (26 U.S.C.A.  115(g) and note), as a stock dividend redeemed; and assessed a deficiency of $5,831.67.\n The taxpayer sought a redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals. A division of the Board concluded, upon testimony and stipulated facts, that there had been no cancellation or redemption of the preferred stock so as to make it a taxable dividend under section 115(g); that the transaction by which the company acquired it constituted a sale. The Commissioner secured a reconsideration of the case. He then contended that, under the rule declared in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Tillotson Mfg. Co. (C. C.A.) 76 F.2d 189, the stock dividend was taxable, because it had resulted in a change of Gowran's proportionate interest in the company. That contention was sustained by the Board; and, on that ground, it affirmed the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency. Gowran v. Com'r, 32 B.T. A. 820.\n The taxpayer sought a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The Commissioner again urged that the stock dividend was taxable; and then, for the first time, contended that, even if it was not taxable, the determination of the deficiency should be affirmed, because within the tax year the stock had been sold at its par value and, as its cost had been zero, the entire proceeds constituted income. The Court of Appeals recognized that, since the dividends in preferred stock gave to Gowran an interest different in character from that which his common stock represented, it was constitutionally taxable under Koshland \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 241]\n\u00a0\n v. Helvering, \n298 \nU.S. 441\n, 56 S.Ct. 767, 105 A.L.R. 756; but it held that the dividend could not be taxed as income, since by section 115(f), 26 U.S.C.A.  115(f) and note, Congress had provided: 'A stock dividend shall not be subject to tax.' And it held further that no part of the proceeds could be taxed as income, since there was no profit on the sale, it being agreed that the fair market value of the stock, both at the date of receipt and at the date of the sale, was $100 a share. Gowran v. Com'r, 87 F.2d 125.\n Because of the importance of the questions presented in the administration of the revenue laws, certiorari was granted. \n301 \nU.S. 676\n, 57 S.Ct. 924\n\n\n First. The government contends that section 115(f) should be read as prohibiting taxation only of those stock dividends which the Constitution does not permit to be taxed; and that, since by the dividend Gowran acquired an interest in the corporation essentially different from that theretofore represented by his common stock, the dividend was taxable. In support of that construction of section 115(f), it is urged that Congress has in income tax legislation manifested generally its intention to use, to the full extent, its constitutional power, Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 50, 52; Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391; that this Court holds grants of immunity from taxation should always be strictly construed, Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 491\n, 52 S.Ct. 424, 426; and that the only reason for exempting stock dividends was to comply with the Constitution.\n This preferred stock had substantially the same attributes as that involved in the Koshland Case. There the dividend was of common stock to a preferred stockholder, it is true; but we are of opinion that under the rule there declared Congress could have taxed this stock dividend. Nevertheless, by section 115(f) it enacted in 1928, as it did in earlier and later Revenue Acts, that 'a stock dividend shall not be subject to tax.' The prohibition is comprehensive. It is so clearly expressed as to leave no room \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n for construction. It extends to all stock dividends. Such was the construction consistently given to it by the Treasury Department. \n1\n The purpose of Congress when enacting section 115(f) may have been merely to comply with the requirement of the Constitution as interpreted in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570; and the comprehensive language in section 115(f) may have been adopted in the erroneous belief that under the rule declared in that case no stock dividend could be taxed. But such facts would not justify the Court in departing from the unmistakable com- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n mand embodied in the statute. Congress declared that the preferred stock should not be taxed as a dividend.\n Second. The government contends that, even if section 115(f) be construed as prohibiting taxation of the preferred stock dividend, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals affirming the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency should be sustained, because the gain from sale of the stock within the year was taxable income and the entire proceeds must be deemed income, since the stock had cost Gowran nothing. The Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that contention. It held that there was no income, because, as stipulated, there was no difference between the value of the stock when received and its value when sold. The court likened a nontaxable stock dividend to a tax-free gift or legacy and said: 'One who receives a tax-free gift and later sells it, in the absence of statute providing otherwise, is taxed upon the profit arising from the difference in its value at the time he receives it and the sale price. Similarly one who receives a tax-free bequest, when selling it, is taxed upon the profit arising from any excess of the sale price over its fair market value at the time of receipt.' Compare Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S.Ct. 199, 64 A.L.R. 362.\n The cases are not analogous. Unlike earlier legislation, section 113( a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  113 note) prescribes specifically the basis for determining the gain on tax-free gifts and legacies. It provides that: 'If the property was acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift.' And the basis for the computation on property transmitted at death is provided for in paragraph (5) of section 113(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  113 note. But the method of computing the income from the sale of stock dividends constitutionally taxable is not specifically provided for. Furthermore, unlike section 22(b)(3), 26 U.S.C.A.  22(b)(3) and note, excluding from gross income the value of gifts and legacies, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n section 115(f) cannot, in view of its history, be taken as a declaration of congressional intent that the value of all stock dividends shall be immune from tax not only when received but also when converted into money or other property. Gain on them is, therefore, to be computed as provided in sections 111 and 113 (26 U.S.C.A.  111 and note 113 note), by the 'excess of the amount realized' over 'the cost of such property' to the taxpayer. As the cost of the preferred stock to Gowran was zero, the whole of the proceeds is taxable.\n Gowran asserts that if this 'basis of zero' theory is accepted, the proceeds are taxable not as determined by the Commissioner but as a capital gain at a different rate and under different regulations. This depends upon whether the preferred stock received as a dividend was a 'capital asset,' defined by section 101(c)(8), 26 U.S.C.A.  101 note, as 'property held by the taxpayer for more than two years.' The record is silent as to when Gowran acquired the common stock upon which the preferred was issued as a dividend, but it may be assumed that he had held it for more than two years. For that fact is immaterial since the dividend stock had been held for only three months. Whether taxed by Congress or not, it was income, substantially equivalent for income tax purposes to cash or property, and under section 115(b), 26 U.S.C.A.  115(b) and note, was presumed to have been made 'out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits.' In no sense, therefore, can it be said to have been 'held' by Gowran prior to its declaration. \n2\n Since the proceeds \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n were therefore not 'capital gains,' they were taxable at the normal and surtax rates applicable to ordinary income. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Gowran contends here that the government should not have been permitted by the Court of Appeals to argue its 'basis of zero' theory, because that theory raised an issue not pleaded, tried, argued, or otherwise referred to in the proceedings before the Board. It is true that the theory was first presented by the Commissioner in the Court of Appeals. But it does not appear by the record that objection to the consideration of this theory was made below. The only objection made there, as disclosed by the opinion, was 'that the Board was without jurisdiction to decide the case upon a point not urged by the commissioner.' As to that objection, the court, after stating that the only questions submitted are those of law, said: 'The Board approved the Commissioner's assessment, but did so upon a legal theory different from his. We are of the opinion that the Board acted within its powers. ... It is immaterial whether the Commissioner proceeded upon the wrong theory. The burden is upon the petitioner to show that the assessment is wrong, upon any proper theory; otherwise he must fail.'\n In the review of judicial proceedings the rule is settled that, if the decision below is correct, it must be affirmed, although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.

Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 56 S.Ct. 185, 187.4 The taxpayer sought review of the Board's decision by the Court of Appeals. The ultimate question before that court was whether, upon the facts stipulated, the Board had erred in affirming the Commissioner's determination that the additional taxes were due. If the Commissioner was right in his determination, the Board properly affirmed it, even if the reasons which he had assigned were wrong. 5 And, likewise, if the Commissioner's determination was right, the Board's affirmance of it should have been sustained by the Court of Appeals, even if the Board gave a wrong reason for its action. By this rule the government was entitled to urge in the Court of Appeals that on the undisputed facts the Board's decision was correct because of the 'basis of zero' theory. And since that court rejected the theory, the government was entitled to assert its contention here. Nothing in General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helver- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 238, 247]\n\u00a0\n ing, supra, or in Helvering v. Salvage, \n297 \nU.S. 106\n, 56 S.Ct. 375, is opposed to such procedure.\n If the Court of Appeals had accepted the theory, it would have been open to the taxpayer to urge, in view of the new issue presented, that he should have the opportunity to establish before the Board additional facts which would affect the result. \n6\n As we accept the new theory, leave is granted Gowran to apply to the lower court for that purpose.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n302 \nU.S. 781\n, 58 S.Ct. 478, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Eisner v.

Article 628 of the regulations in force in 1928 provided: 'Stock dividends.-The issuance of its own stock by a corporation as a dividend to its shareholders does not result in taxable income to such shareholders, but gain may be derived or loss sustained by the shareholders from the sale of such stock. The amount of gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of such stock, or from the sale of the stock in respect of which it is issued, shall be determined as provided in Articles 561 and 600.'\n Koshland v. Helvering, \n298 \nU.S. 441\n, 56 S.Ct. 767, 105 A.L.R. 756, was decided May 18, 1936. On June 22, 1936, Congress, in enacting the Revenue Act of 1936, provided in section 115(f), 26 U.S.C.A.  115(f): '(1). General Rule. A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does not constitute income to the shareholders within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution.' 49 Stat. 1648, 1688.

But this was based upon the erroneous premise that stock dividends could not be income, and was part of an administrative scheme to apportion some of the cost of the original shares to the stock received by way of dividend. This arrangement we declared in Koshland v. Helvering, \n298 \nU.S. 441\n, 56 S.Ct. 767, 105 A.L.R. 756, to be without statutory authority, and the same must be said of the regulation involved here. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Burnet v.

CO.(1937)\nNo. 257\nArgued: January 7, 1937Decided: February 15, 1937\n\n\n[ Helvering v. Midland Mut Life Ins Co   \n300 \nU.S. 216\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 217]\n\u00a0\n\n  Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n  Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Since 1921, the Revenue Acts have made this provision for taxing the income of life insurance companies. \n1\n The gross income is limited to that 'received during the taxable year from interest, dividends, and rents.' Upon the net income, ascertained by making prescribed deductions, the tax under the act here applicable is 12 per cent. \n2\n The general provisions of the Revenue Acts concerning capital 'gains and losses' and 'bad debts' are not applicable to life insurance companies. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n  In 1930, the Midland Mutual Life Insurance Company of Ohio caused to be foreclosed several mortgages on real estate given to secure loans which were in default. It was the only bidder; its bid was accepted; the property was conveyed to it; and in no case was there redemption. At each foreclosure sale the company had bid an amount which included interest as well as the principal. The interest so bid, aggregating on the foreclosed mortgages $5,456.99, was not included in the company's income tax return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue decided that this interest was taxable and, accordingly, determined a deficiency in the company's income tax for 1930. His determination was approved by the Board of Tax Appeals. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Board, 83 F.(2d) 629. We granted certiorari because of conflict with Helvering v. Missouri State Life \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 221]\n\u00a0\n Ins. Co., 78 F.(2d) 778, and National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 4 F. Supp. 1000.\n  The following additional facts stipulated were adopted by the Board of Tax Appeals as its findings: The company kept its books on a 'calendar year' 'cash receipts and disbursements' basis, entering only payments of interest actually made to it during the year. Upon its acquiring title to the foreclosed properties, the investments were transferred on its books from the mortgage loan account to the real estate account and were carried thereon as assets at amounts which were equal to the principal of the loans secured by the mortgages plus any disbursements made for taxes, court costs, attorneys fees or insurance premiums. The amount of interest included in the bids on foreclosure was not carried on the books as part of the cost of the properties or as an asset. Nor was it entered on the books or likewise treated as income. All of the properties here involved were located in states where a period of redemption from foreclosure is allowed. The company issued to its representatives having charge of foreclosures in those states general instructions to bid on its behalf such sums as would enable the company to realize no loss on account of its investment in case of redemption. The bids here involved were made pursuant to those instructions, without regard to the then actual value of the mortgage property. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 222]\n\u00a0\n  The company introduced evidence that the fair market value of the properties was, at the dates of foreclosure and of acquiring title, less than the amount of the principal due on the mortgages. This evidence was deemed by the Board immaterial; and it accordingly made no finding as to fair market value. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n  First. The company contends that it did not 'receive' the $5,456.99 ( or any part thereof) either in cash or in property; and, hence, that it was not 'gross income.' Confessedly no interest was received in cash. The company insists that none was received in property. It argues that its bid may not be taken as conclusive evidence of the value of the property, invoking Ballentyne v. Smith, \n205 \nU.S. 285\n; that the Board's refusal to consider the evidence as to value requires us to hold that the real estate acquired on foreclosure was of a fair value less than the amount of the principal of the mortgage debt; that the proceeds of a mortgage sale must be applied first to the satisfaction of the principal before income may be held received, citing Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, and that since the value did not equal the principal, there were no proceeds of the sales applicable to the interest, hence, no taxable income. In support of this argument, the company points to the fact that it did not, on its books, treat the delinquent interest as income; did not, directly or indirectly, carry the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 223]\n\u00a0\n interest as part of the cost of the properties or as an asset; and did not include the interest as an asset in its annual statement or in its reports to insurance departments.\n  The arguments rest upon a misconception. The terms 'interest,' 'dividends,' and 'rents,' employed in the statute simply and without qualification or elaboration, were plainly used by Congress in their generic meanings, as broadly descriptive of certain kinds of 'income.' Compare Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 344\n; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 86\n, 51. We cannot say that Congress did not intend to include in its definition a case like the present merely because the taxpayer received a credit rather than money or other tangible property. Compare Raybestos- Manhattan, Inc., v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 60, 62\n, 64, 64, 65, 102 A.L.R. 111. A receipt of interest is taxable as income whether paid in cash or by a credit. Compare Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n; United States v. Boston & Maine R.R., \n279 \nU.S. 732\n. This credit, it is true, was not entered on the taxpayer's books as interest or as an asset. But bookkeeping entries, though in some circumstances of evidential value, are not determinative of tax liability. Compare Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 187\n. The intent to use the full extent of power being clearly evident, we must not confine the legislation within narrower forms than the statutory language would indicate. Compare Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 166\n; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, supra, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 89\n, 55 S. Ct. 50, 52.\n  Second. The company argues that uncontradicted evidence shows the fair market value of the mortgaged properties to have been less than the principal of the debts and that therefore the interest paid was not income within the meaning of the act. A mortgagee who, at foreclosure sale, acquires the property pursuant to a bid of the principal and accrued interest is, as purchaser and grantee, in a position no different from that of a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 224]\n\u00a0\n stranger who acquires the property on a bid of like amount. It is true that the latter would be obliged to pay in cash the amount of his bid, while the formality of payment in cash is ordinarily dispensed with when the mortgagee acquires the property on his own bid. But the rights acquired qua purchaser are the same in either case; and, likewise, the legal effect upon the mortgage debt is the same. In each case the debt, including the interest accrued, is paid. Where the stranger makes the purchase, the debt is discharged by a payment in cash; where the mortgagee purchases the property, the debt is discharged by means of a credit. The amount so credited to the mortgagor as interest paid would be available to him as a deduction in making his own income tax returns. \n6\n It would be strange if the sum deductible by the mortgagor debtor were not chargeable to the mortgage creditor as income received. Where the legal effect of a transaction fits the plain letter of the statute, the tax is held payable, unless there is clearly revealed in the act itself or in its history a definite intention to exclude such transactions from the operation of its applicable language. See Central National Bank v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 355, 364\n;7 Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 268\n; Provost v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 443, 456\n, 457, 458, 154, 155; Old Colony R.R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 561, 213, 214. Respondent here makes no such showing.\n  Third. The company argues that taxation is a practical matter; that we should be governed by realities; that the reality is, that all the company got was the property; and that the property was worth less than the principal of the debt. The 'reality' of the deal here involved \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 225]\n\u00a0\n would seem to be that respondent valued the protection of the higher redemption price as worth the discharge of the interest debt for which it might have obtained a judgment. Moreover, the company's argument ignores the needs of an efficient saystem of taxation. The administration of the income tax law would be seriously burdened if it were held that when a mortgagee bids in the property for a sum including unpaid interest, he may not be taxed on the interest received except upon an inquiry into the probable fair market value of the property. \n8\n 'At best, evidence of value is largely a matter of opinion, especially as to real estate.' Montana Railway Co. v. Warren, \n137 \nU.S. 348, 353\n, 97. There is nothing unfamiliar in taxing on the basis of the legal effect of a transaction. Income may be realized upon a change in the nature of legal rights held, though the particular taxpayer has enjoyed no addition to his economic worth. Compare Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 346; United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 170\n, 171, 42 S. Ct. 63, 66; Marr v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 536, 540\n, 45 S. Ct. 575, 576; Burnet v. Commonwealth Improvement Co., \n287 \nU.S. 415, 419\n, 420, 199. 'The income tax laws do not profess to embody perfect economic theory. They ignore some things that neither a theorist or a business man would take into account in determining the pecuniary condition of the taxpayer.' Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 335\n. Compare Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 516\n; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 359, 69 A.L.R. 758.9 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 226]\n\u00a0\n  Fourth. The company contends that to tax the mortgagee as upon interest received is inconsistent with the rule declared in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 594\n, 865, 97 A.L.R. 1106, that the mortgagee is entitled to have 'the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt, either through receipt of the proceeds of a fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself.' The charge of inconsistency is unfounded. The company exercised its right to have a sale. At the sale, it was free either to bid or to refrain from bidding. If it bid, it was free to bid such sum as it pleased. It chose to bid the full amount of principal and interest. Thus it obtained, in legal contemplation, full payment of the interest as well as the principal. To tax the company upon the full amount of interest received as a result of its own bid in no way impairs its rights as mortgagee. Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 285, 289\n. If the bid had been insufficient to yield full payment of the mortgage debt, principal, and interest, the company would have been entitled to a judgment for the deficiency. If the company had refrained from bidding, and a stranger had bid more than the principal, the company would obviously have been taxable upon the excess up to the amount of the interest due. Perhaps it was the company's custom of bidding the full amount of principal and interest which deterred bidding by others.\n  Reversed.\n\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n  The judgment below, I think, is correct and should be affirmed. A well-considered opinion supports it. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 216\n, 227]\n\u00a0\n  The notion that Congress intended to tax the mere hope of recouping a loss some time in the future should be definitely rejected.\n  To support the assertion that here the company collected interest, when in fact everything received was worth less than the sum loaned, requires resort to theory at war with patent facts. The company got nothing out of which to pay the exactment; its assets were not augmented. Like imaginary 'receipts' of interest often repeated and similarly burdened would hasten bankruptcy.\n  Divorced from reality, taxation becomes sheer oppression. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 688\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See National Life Insurance Co. v.

By Michigan law, it is said, the mortgagor is allowed one year from the date of the foreclosure sale within which he may redeem the property by paying to the purchaser the amount bid for the property plus interest from the time of the sale at the rate borne by the mortgage, even though the amount of such bid be less than the total amount of the mortgagee's investment in the property. See Comp.Laws 1929, c. 266,  14435, 14436; compare Vosburgh v. Lay, 45 Mich. 455, 8 N.W. 91. The purchaser cannot, under the local law, acquire title until after the expiration of the redemption period. See Comp.Laws 1929, c. 266,  14434. The mortgagee may, 'fairly and in good faith,' bid the property in (Id.,  14432), and he enjoys the same rights as purchaser as would a third party. See Ledyard v.

It is, therefore, disregarded. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Revenue Act of 1928,  23(b), 45 Stat. 791, 799 (26 \nU.S.C.A.  23 note).  \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See, also, Kentucky Improvement Co. v.

PFEIFFER(1937)\nNo. 29\nArgued: October 22, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John C. Altman, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents questions of income taxation applicable to stock dividends.\n In 1931, Annie M. Pfeiffer, a holder of common stock in William R. Warner Corporation, received as a dividend thereon 6,291 1\/4 shares of its preferred stock. She also received from the corporation in that year $200, 000 cash in exchange for 2,000 shares of its preferred stock which she had received as a dividend in 1928. In her income tax return for 1931, she did not include as taxable income either the preferred stock or the $200,000 cash. She did not include the preferred stock received in that year, because she deemed it exempt from taxation under section 115(f) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  115(f) and note). She did not include the $200,000 cash as taxable income, because she considered it the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset. But she did include $180,100 thereof as taxable capital gain on the sale, computing the gain in accordance with the then effective Treasury Regulations. And she paid a tax of $22,512.50 on such capital gain.\n The Commissioner assessed a deficiency on each item. He determined that the 6,291 1\/4 shares of preferred stock valued at $629,125, were taxable income of 1931, because not exempt under section 115(f); and that the $200,000 cash were the proceeds of a redemption under section 115(g), 26 U.S.C.A.  115(g) and note, and hence taxable income. He eliminated the taxable capi- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 249]\n\u00a0\n tal gain reported and assessed a deficiency on each of the items.\n The taxpayer sought a review by the Board of Tax Appeals. It affirmed the Commissioner's determination that the preferred stock received in 1931 was taxable income; but reversed his determination as to the proceeds of the 2,000 shares, and said: 'The Commissioner held that the redemption of the 2,000 shares in 1931 was at such time and in such manner as to be substantially equivalent to a taxable dividend in 1931, within the meaning of section 115(g) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  115(g) and note). He erred in this since the distribution was subject to tax as a dividend in 1928 (see cases above cited). Thereafter the shares had a basis for gain or loss to the petitioner of $100 each, and they were redeemed without gain or loss to the petitioner at $100 each in 1931.'\n The Commissioner acquiesced in the Board's decision. The taxpayer sought a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It reversed the Board's decision as to the 1931 stock dividend, on the ground that section 115(f) exempted that dividend from taxation; and it affirmed the Board's decision that the $200,000 cash was not taxable income of 1931, saying (Pfeiffer v. Comm. of Internal Revenue, 88 F.2d 3, 5): 'The appellee argues that the proceeds from the redemption in 1931 of 2,000 shares of preferred stock distributed as a stock dividend in 1928 should be considered either (a) subject to a tax as a capital gain or (b) subject to taxation as the equivalent of the distribution of a taxable dividend pursuant to section 115(g) of the Revenue Act. The question of taxability as capital gain of the $200,000 or any part thereof was not in issue before or decided by the Board of Tax Appeals. The contention that we have authority to sustain the deficiency pro tanto even though the issue was not raised before the Board nor decided by it nor assigned as error in the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n petition to this court for a review of the Board's decision is untenable. General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200\n, 56 S.Ct. 185; Helvering v. Salvage, \n297 \nU.S. 106\n, 56 S.Ct. 375. The Board held that this stock dividend redeemed in 1931 at $100 per share was taxable in the year 1928 when received and was therefore not taxable under section 115(g); that it had a basis for gain or loss of $100 per share; and that therefore there was no taxable income from the redemption. The Commissioner did not file a cross-appeal. By the provisions of section 115(g) the proceeds of the redemption of the stock can be taxed only if it occurs at such time and in such manner as to make the redemption essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend. Since the Board did not so find, we cannot support this contention.'\n The Commissioner's petition for certiorari was granted in connection with that in Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238\n, 58 S.Ct. 154, decided this day.\n First. As to the 1931 dividend in preferred stock, the Commissioner contends that the immunity from taxation conferred by section 115(f) did not extend to it. We hold, for the reasons stated in paragraph first of Helvering v. Gowran, that it was exempt from taxation.\n Second. As to the $200,000 received in 1931, the Commissioner contends that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in failing to hold it taxable income, since under the rule declared in Helvering v. Gowran, the cost was zero.\n We are not at liberty to entertain that contention. The Board of Tax Appeals decided that the $200,000 was not taxable income of 1931. As the Commissioner did not seek a review of that decision, which was adverse to him, the Circuit Court of Appeals properly refused to consider the contention. General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 56 S.Ct. 185, 187. While a decision \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n below may be sustained, without a cross-appeal, although it was rested upon a wrong ground, see Helvering v. Gowran, an appellee cannot without a cross-appeal attack a judgment entered below. Compare United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 44 S.Ct. 560, 563; Morley Construction Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., \n300 \nU.S. 185\n, 57 S.Ct. 325.1 The same rule applies to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.\n Third. The Commissioner requests that, if we hold that the Board erred in declaring that the 2,000 shares received in 1928 were then taxable and refuse to review its decision that the proceeds received in 1931 were not taxable, we should remand the case to the Board to determine whether redemption of the 2,000 shares was made at such time and in such manner as to be essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend under section 115(g). The Commission acquiesced in the decision of the Board. No good reason is shown for disturbing it.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO think the judgment should be reversed.\n The issue before the Board of Tax Appeals was the existence of a deficiency in respondent's income tax for a single year, 1931. The deficiency fixed by the Commissioner represented her net tax liability for that year and drew in question every item which entered into computation of the tax. Lewis v. Reynolds, \n284 \nU.S. 281, 283\n, 52 S.Ct. 145, 146. Her appeal to the Board drew in question her net tax liability on a re-examination of every item of income in that year which she had challenged in her peti- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n tion. The Commissioner had treated as taxable income of respondent two items, both received in that year, and assessed a deficiency accordingly. They were a dividend paid to the taxpayer in preferred stock, and cash received by her in that year upon the redemption of preferred stock received as a dividend in an earlier year. The Board of Tax Appeals thought respondent was taxable in 1931 on the first but not on the second item, and reduced the deficiency accordingly. It 'Ordered and decided, that there is a deficiency for the year 1931 in the amount of $89,841.75.'\n This Court, upon consideration of the facts stipulated by the parties and found by the Board, holds that respondent was taxable upon the full amount of the item of cash received but no upon the stock dividend. But, because the Commissioner took no appeal from the order of the Board, the Court declines to give any effect to its ruling that the cash is taxable income in 1931. If the Commissioner had sought only to increase the deficiency found by the Board, it may be conceded that the point would be well taken, but such is not his purpose. On the contrary, he accepts the order and relies upon it as establishing a deficiency of which he asks the benefit only so far as it is sustained by the application, to the facts found, of the rule of law announced by this Court.\n The circumstance that the Board, by the erroneous application of a rule of law to the facts before it arrived at a deficiency which is sustained by a correct application of a different rule, is not ground for setting aside its order. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 538\n, 539 S., 51 S.Ct. 243, 246; Anderson, Receiver v. Atherton, Administrator, \n302 \nU.S. 643\n, 58 S.Ct. 53, 82 L.Ed. --, decided October 18, 1937; compare Morley Construction Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., \n300 \nU.S. 185\n, 57 S.Ct. 325. In denying to the Commissioner any benefit of the order because he did not appeal, the opinion of the Court gives no hint of any ground upon which the Commissioner should or could have appealed so far as the order fixes a deficiency which the record shows is lawfully due or \n\n[302 \nU.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n why the respondent is not free to maintain that the Board reached the right result even though the reason it gave was wrong.\n The cause should be remanded to the Board of Tax Appeals to recompute the deficiency in conformity with the rule of tax liability laid down in the opinion of this Court, but in an amount not exceeding that which the Board has found.\n General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200\n, 56 S.Ct. 185, does not require any different result. There it was held that it was error for the Circuit Court of Appeals, on an appeal by the Commissioner, to reverse an order of the Board and remand the cause for new findings to support a theory of tax liability which first emerged from the case on appeal. Here there is no new issue to be tried by the Board. The only issue is one of law which this Court has resolved and which has been implicit in the case from the beginning. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, The Stephan Morgan, \n94 \nU.S. 599\n; Mount Pleasant v.

In 1925 the Commissioner gave notice of deficiencies. These claims were based on a transaction in 1919 which included transfer by Tex-Penn Oil Company of all its assets to Transcontinental Oil Company, the issue and delivery by the latter of 1,007,834 shares to Benedum and Parriott, the stockholders of Tax-Penn, and the dissolution of that company. The Commissioner claims that the consideration for the transfer included not only the stock but also $350,000 in cash paid by Transcontinental to Tax-Penn. Respondents petitioned the Board of Tax Appeals for redetermination. The cases were consolidated for hearing; the Board made findings of circumstantial facts on the basis of which it concluded in an 'ultimate finding' that the consideration for the transfer by Tex-Penn to Transcontinental included cash, and that therefore the transaction was not one in which, under Revenue Act of 1918,  202(b), 40 Stat. 1060, 'no gain or loss shall be deemed to occur.' It redetermined deficiencies of $2,871,085, $1,925,466, and $908,470, respectively. 28 B.T.A. 917. Respondents petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. It reversed the orders with directions that the Board enter judgments of no deficiencies. Tex-Penn Oil Co. v. Com'r, 83 F.(2d) 518.\n  1. The first ultimate finding is (28 B.T.A. 917, at page 950): 'The consideration received by Tex-Penn on or about August 1, 1919, in exchange for its assets consisted of $350,000 in cash and 1,007,834 shares of Transcontinental stock of no par value.'\n  The first question for decision is whether that conclusion in supported by evidence. If well grounded, the transaction is not within the nonrecognition of gain pro- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 484]\n\u00a0\n vision of section 202(b). That section declares that 'when in connection with the reorganization, merger, or consolidation of a corporation a person receives in place of stock or securities owned by him new stock or securities of no greater aggregate par or face value, no gain or loss shall be deemed to occur from the exchange, and the new stock or securities received shall be treated as taking the place of the stock, securities, or property exchanged.'\n  Treasury Regulations 45, art. 1567,1 contains an interpretation of that provision: 'In general where two (or more) corporations unite their properties by * * * the sale of its property by B to A and the dissolution of B * * * no taxable income is received from the transaction * * * provided the sole consideration received by B and its stockholders * * * is stock * * * of A * * *'\n  The pertinent substance of the circumstantial facts found follows:\n  In 1917 and early 1918, respondents Benedum and Parriott and three others, Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather, acquired 31 Texas oil and gas leases called the 'Duke-Knoles' group. The leases reserved to lessors a one- eighth royalty. The interest of the five in what the findings refer to as the remaining seven-eighths interest were Benedum six-sixteenths, Parriott and Kirkland three-sixteenths each, Lantz and Wrather two-sixteenths each. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 485]\n\u00a0\n  In October, 1918, they caused Tex-Penn to be incorporated. Its authorized capital stock was $2,000,000, divided into 80,000 shares of $25 each. It issued 4,000 shares for par to the five lease owners ratably according to their interests; they transferred a fourth interest in the leases to the company. It agreed to develop the properties at its own expense; they agreed that one-half of their shares of the proceeds might be used to make up deficits in the company's operating expenses.\n  They authorized Parriott to receive their shares of the proceeds, to carry out the agreement with the company, and to invest the remaining half of the proceeds in the company's stock. Accounts of transactions between the company and him, as agent, were kept under the name of 'Parriott Attorney.' Pursuant to the agreement, he from time to time purchased at par stock of the company amounting to 9,120 shares; it used the money in developing the leased properties.\n  Benedum and Parriott were also interested as owners in the Riverside Eastern Oil Company, the Riverside Western Oil Company, and the Pittsburgh- Texas Oil & Gas Company. In early 1919, they decided to cause to be organized the Transcontinental Oil Company to acquire and operate the properties of these companies and of Tex-Penn together with the individually owned interests in the leases. Benedum's four associates, by writing dated June 2, 1919, gave him authority to sell the assets of Tex- Penn and all individual interests in the leases for $12,000,000, and agreed to accept their pro rata share of the net proceeds of the sale for their holdings in Tex-Penn and their individual interests in the leases.\n  To arrange for money with which to carry out the project, Benedum negotiated with bankers. Under the first plan, the bankers were to pay Transcontinental $23,000,000 for a part of its stock, and that amount was to be used to pay the $12,000,000, and $2,500,000 in equal parts to Riverside Eastern and Riverside Western to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 486]\n\u00a0\n retire preferred stock. The balance, $8,500,000, was to be retained by Transcontinental for working capital. By a later arrangement the amount to be paid by the bankers was reduced to $20,000,000 and that to be received by the five individuals to $9,000,000. Benedum's associates declined to accept less than their proportionate share of $12,000,000 as originally planned. In order that the undertaking should not fail, Benedum agreed to diminish by $3,000,000 the amount he was to have and so bore the entire reduction. On that basis, distribution of the 9,000,000 would be $1,500, 000 each to Benedum, Lantz, and Wrather and $2,250,000 each to Parriott and Kirkland.\n  Transcontinental was organized and authorized to issue 2,000,000 no- par-value shares, of which the bankers agreed to buy 500,000 at $40 per share. They exercised an option to buy 225,000 additional shares at $1 per share. Tex-Penn's assets were to pass to Transcontinental free and clear of all liabilities. July 12, Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather assigned and delivered their Tex-Penn shares to Benedum and Parriott for $30.2 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 487]\n\u00a0\n July 15, the stock was transferred on the Tex-Penn stock book. July 22, new directors were elected to take the places of the assignors who, as stated in the minutes, had ceased to be stockholders.\n  July 14, the individual owners and Tex-Penn executed an assignment to Transcontinental of all their interest in the leases and gave it to Parriott in escrow for delivery upon payment of $5,250,000 to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather, or to Parriott for their account. They stipulated that if payment was not made by August 1, the assignment and stock would be returned to them. And, in order that Tex-Penn assets might be free from liability, they authorized Parriott to deduct from their shares seven- sixteenths of not exceeding $500,000 to pay debts and obligations of the company. Benedum and Parriott were to bear nine-sixteenths. The auditor of Tex-Penn reported that approximately $350,000 would be required.\n  July 24, Benedum and Parriott made a contract with J. M. Holliday, acting for the bankers and Transcontinental, in which they agreed to transfer to Transcontinental their interests in the leases for $3,400,000 in cash, to cause Tex-Penn to transfer to Transcontinental all its assets 'for and in consideration of * * * $350,000 in cash and * * * 1,007,834 shares of the capital stock of * * * Transcontinental,' and to cause Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather to transfer to Transcontinental their seven- sixteenths of the five-eighths interest in the leases for $5,250,000 in cash.\n  The same day, Holliday addressed an offer to Tex-Penn to purchase all its assets 'for * * * $350,000 in cash \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 488]\n\u00a0\n and * * * 1,007,834 shares' of Transcontinental. By resolution of its directors, Tex-Penn accepted the offer, referring to the consideration as '$ 350,000 cash and * * * 1,007,834 shares' of Transcontinental. It was further resolved that, after the transfer of its property, the collection of debts due, and payment of those owed by, Tex-Penn, it would be dissolved and its assets distributed to its stockholders 'and that to facilitate this, the * * * officers * * * direct Mr. Holliday that * * * $ 350,000 * * * shall be paid to the treasury of this company, and that the * * * shares * * * be issued and delivered to' Benedum and Parriott jointly.\n  July 30, Tex-Penn conveyed its assets to Transcontinental. Holliday directed the latter to deliver to Benedum and Parriott jointly certificates for 1,007,834 shares, to deliver $5,250,000 to Parriott Attorney, $3,400,000 to Benedum and Parriott and $350,000 to Tex-Penn. The next day, these directions were carried out by Transcontinental.\n  There was available for use by Tex-Penn in payment of its expenses $ 286,891.29, derived from one-half of the proceeds from the individually owned five-eighths interest in the leases. It also had receivables and oil and the $350,000 with which to discharge its liabilities. The $350,000 was deducted by Transcontinental from the amount to be paid Benedum and Parriott for their interest in the leases. But that deduction was in fact borne not by them alone, but ratably by the five owners. Payment of Tex- Penn's liabilities did not require use of all the $350,000. There remained $ 55,255.24. And that sum was distributed to the five individuals according to their interests in the leases.\n  Details are reflected in the accounts of 'Parriott Attorney.' Kirkland was given credit for $2,250,000 and Lantz and Wrather for $1,500, 000 each as purchase prices of their shares of the five-eighths interest in the leases. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 489]\n\u00a0\n Each of the five, according to his interest in the leases, was charged with his share of the $350,000 with the explanation that 'this amount was to be apportioned against the sale price received by all the individual interests.' 3\n  In respect of the transfer of the Tex-Penn stock by Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather to Benedum and Parriott, the latter were charged $15 each and correspondingly each of the former was credited with $10. At the end of the year, Parriott furnished annual statements to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather, showing the sale prices of their interests in the leases reduced by their contributions to the $350,000. The sales price of the stock sold by them was shown at $30. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 490]\n\u00a0\n  On partial distributions by Parriott before final settlement, Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather gave receipts similar in form. That of Kirkland recited that the payment was on account of the purchase price of his interest 'in and to * * * the leases * * * and to the stock of the Tex- Penn. * * * The balance * * * is to be retained until the final adjustment of the taxes and the affairs of * * * Tex-Penn * * * at the conclusion of which the said balance is to be paid to me, less my proportionate share of said expenses.' Kirland and Lantz died before the hearing. Wrather testified that he attached no great importance to the form of the receipt; that he knew there had been in form separate transfers of the lease interests and the Tex-Penn stock but that he and his associates considered only the ultimate objective.\n  Benedum and Parriott in their 1919 income tax returns reported their own profits from the sale of their lease interests upon the basis of the total price of $8,650,000. Tex-Penn's return stated that it had sold its assets for $350,000 cash and shares of stock. It also stated that the cost of the assets sold was.$2,359,205.69, from which it deducted $350,000, leaving $2,009,205.69, and that amount was designated 'value of stock.' Neither the $350,000 nor the stated 'value of stock' received was included in gross income. A schedule attached to the return stated that the cash consideration was accounted for in the return, and that the 'no par value stock' received was not taxable income under section 202(b) and T.D. 2924.\n  The foregoing includes the substance of all the findings of circumstantial facts material to the question under consideration. They must be taken as established if supported by substantial evidence. Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 736; Old Mission Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 161; Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136, 138\n, 139, 346; Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 \nU.S. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 491]\n\u00a0\n 589, 600, 612; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n. There is no suggestion that they are not amply sustained. In addition to and presumably upon the basis of these findings the Board made its 'ultimate finding.' And upon that determination it ruled that the transaction was not within the nonrecognition provisions of section 202(b). The ultimate finding is a conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact. It is to be distinguished from the findings of primary, evidentiary, or circumstantial facts. It is subject to judicial review and, on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of the Board. Helvering v. Rankin, ubisupra.\n  Treating the transaction as a part of reorganization, merger, or consolidation, of reorganization, merger, or consolidation, the Board concluded that cash constituted a part of the consideration. The opinion refers to writings above mentioned and emphasizes their provisions that state or indicate that the consideration was to or did include cash and stock. The documents cited are the agreement for the transfer of Tex- Penn's assets to Transcontinental, the offer to Tex-Penn, the resolution of its directors accepting the offer and directing payment of the $350,000 to its treasury, Holliday's letter directing Transcontinental so to pay, Transcontinental's check for that amount to Tex-Penn and the latter's tax return.\n  But the Board's findings of what was actually done show that, pursuant to direction of the individuals selling lease interests, Transcontinental advanced to Tex-Penn $350,000 and deducted that amount from the price of the lease interests. The findings also show that, for the part of that amount remaining after payment of its debts, Tex-Penn accounted to the individuals.\n  As indirectly showing that the $350,000 constituted part of the consideration for transfer of Tex-Penn assets, the opinion cites the entry in the 'Parriott Attorney' accounts showing that the effect of the payment of that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 492]\n\u00a0\n sum to Tex-Penn was to reduce the sale price of the interest in the leases from $9,000,000 to $8,650,000, the entries distributing that amount to the five individuals, and the tax returns of Benedum, Parriott, and Tex-Penn.\n  Petitioner does not bring forward these entries or the tax returns of Benedum and Parriott to support the Board's ultimate finding now under consideration. Manifestly, the entries referred to in the Board's opinion are opposed to its conclusion. As will more fully appear, upon an examination of them later to be made, the findings of details make it plain that the $350,000 was a part of the consideration paid for the individually owned lease interests and leave no ground for any other inference.\n  The Board's opinion shows that both parties relied on art. 1567 as a correct interpretation of the statute. The Board held (28 B.T.A. 917, at page 959) that it 'requires, as a condition of nonrecognition of gain, that the sole consideration be stock or securities. * * * The written agreements herein indicate clearly that there was a cash consideration to Tex-Penn of $350,000. We are not convinced by the oral evidence that that was not a fact. Accordingly, we hold that the petitioners have not brought themselves within section 202(b) * * * and article 1567 * * * so as to escape recognition of gain.'\n  The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, after discussion of primary or evidentiary facts found by the board, states, 83 F.(2d) 518, at page 522: 'A consideration of all the documentary evidence drives us to the conclusion that the $350,000 was not consideration passing from Transcontinental to Tex-Penn, but was money furnished by the lessees as individuals to pay the debts of Tex-Penn so that the transaction might be made according to agreement. * * * In form the documents upon which the Board of Tax Appeals relied stated that the $350,000 was corporate consideration passing from Transcontinental, but in fact it was not, and the rule is well settled that in determining tax liability, taxing authorities must \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 493]\n\u00a0\n look through form to fact and substance. It has been a long time since these transactions took place, and most of the parties who were interested in them are dead; but every living person who was in any way connected with them testified without contradiction that the $350,000 was paid by the five lessees and not by Transcontinental.'\n  The validity of the ultimate finding above quoted is to be tested by what in fact was done rather than by the mere form of words used in the writings employed. United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 65; Curran v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 129, 131. The Board's findings of circumstantial facts definitely show the substance of the transaction as actually consummated. Summarily stated, the details of controlling significance are these:\n  The bankers bought from Transcontinental 725,000 shares of its stock for $20,225,000. Transcontinental paid and issued its stock:\n   Cash Shares\n  Riverside Eastern $1,250,000  41,666   Riverside Western 1,250,000 41,667   Pittsburg-Texas   158,833   Benedum and Parriott  3,400,000 1,007,834   Parriott, Attorney  5,250,000    Tex-Penn  350,000     ---------- ----------    11,500,000 1,250,000\n\n  Included in the total was $9,000,000 to pay for the individually owned five-eighths interest in the leases and $2,500,000 to retire preferred stock of Riverside Eastern and Riverside Western, and $5,250,000 to pay for seven-sixteenths of the five-eighths interest: $2,250,000 to Kirkland and $1,500,000 each to Lantz and Wrather. The remaining $3,750, 000 was to pay Benedum and Parriott for their nine-sixteenths: $1,500,000 to Benedum for his six-sixteenths and $2,250,000 to Parriott for his three- sixteenths.\n  The $350,000 received by Tex-Penn from Transcontinental was to be used to the extent needed to pay Tex- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 494]\n\u00a0\n Penn's debts in order that its assets should be free and clear of liabilities. But no part of that amount was borne by Transcontinental. Upon authorization of Benedum and Parriott, it deducted that amount from the $3,750,000 payable by it to them. And, by arrangement among themselves, the five individuals were chargeable with the $350,000 according to their interests in the leases:\n  Benedum  $131,250   Parriott  65,625   Kirkland  65,625   Lantz 43,750   Wrather  43,750    -----------    $350,000\n   The amount so advanced exceeded what was required to pay Tex-Penn's debts by $55,255.24. And to the five individuals that amount was accounted for:\n  Benedum  $20,720.73   Parriott  10,360.35   Kirkland  10,360.35   Lantz 6,906.90   Wrather  6,906.90    ------------    $55,255.23\n\n  The statement below shows in column (1) the amounts that, but for the advance of $350,000 to Tex-Penn, each of the individuals would have received directly from Transcontinental in cash for his interest in the leases; it shows in column (2) the amount that was received by each after deducting his share of the amount actually used to discharge liabilities of Tex-Penn.\n    (1) (2)   Benedum  $1,500,000 $1,389,470.73   Parriott  2,250,000 2,194,735.35   Kirkland  2,250,000 2,194,735,35   Lantz 1,500,000 1,463,156.90   Wrather  1,500,000 1,463,156,90    ----------- --------------    9,000,000 $8,705,255.23 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 495]\n\u00a0\n  The Board's findings of evidentiary details not only fail to support, but definitely negative, its conclusion that the consideration received by Tex-Penn in exchange for its assets included $350,000 in cash.\n  Essential to the project was the transfer to Transcontinental of Tex- Penn assets free from claims and equally indispensable was the transfer of the individually owned lease interests. Tex-Penn needed money to satisfy demands of its creditors. Should it be unable to free its property from liability, the entire enterprise might fail. In that event, the individuals would lose the sale of their lease interests. And so, they decided to provide the cash needed by Tex-Penn to clear its assets and for that purpose they caused Transcontinental to advance Tex-Penn the $350,000 and deduct it from $9,000,000, the price it was to pay them for their lease interests. The excess, $55,255.24, was ratably distributed as shown above. No part of the $350,000 was included in or had any relation to the consideration for the transfer of the Tex-Penn assets. In legal effect, the details found by the Board to have been carried out are not to be distinguished from a direct advance by the five individuals to Tex-Penn of the money required to pay its debts. Unquestionably, such an advance would not constitute consideration received by Tex-Penn. As against the Board's findings showing what was actually done in consummation of the transaction, no weight as evidence can be given to mere recitals, directions, engagements, and admissions of respondents contained in the documents relied on by the Board. It should have held that the Transcontinental stock was the sole consideration for the transfer of the Tex-Penn assets. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that the ruling to the contrary was erroneous.\n  2. The Board's second ultimate finding is (28 B.T.A. 917, at page 950 ): 'The cash received by Wrather, Lantz, and Kirkland from Transcontinental was consideration for both their \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 496]\n\u00a0\n stock in Tex-Penn and their interests in the Duke-Knoles leases.' The Board (28 B.T.A. 917, at page 959) deemed that conclusion an additional ground for its ruling that the transaction is not within the nonrecognition provisions of section 202(b). In support of that view the Commissioner maintains that 'the nominal sale of stock, the transfer of the assets of Tex-Penn, and the sale of the individual interests in the leases, constituted a single indivisible transaction.'\n  But the circumstantial facts clearly negative this ultimate finding. Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather sold their Tex-Penn stock to Benedum and Parriott and their lease interests to Transcontinental. The stock was sold and delivered before the assignment of the lease interests was made. The transfer on the company's stock book was effected, and their connection as stockholders and directors was terminated, while the lease interests were being held until paid for by Transcontinental. The stipulation that, if payment for their lease interests was not made by August 1, the assignment of their shares of stock would be returned, did not make the two sales a single or indivisible transaction. Assuming that Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather would not have sold their Tex-Penn stock without also selling their lease interests, that fact would not convert the two sales into one. The purpose of the stipulation is plain. If Transcontental did not pay for and take the lease interests and Tex-Penn continued to operate the properties, they would again become stockholders and have a voice in the operation.\n  On the point under consideration, the Commissioner's position before the Board is not in harmony with his contention here. There he made four computations: Two were of Tex-Penn taxes, the other two were respectively those of the other respondents. In all his calculations, he attributed to the consideration for Tex-Penn assets the 1,007,834 shares of Transcontinental and to the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 497]\n\u00a0\n Benedum and Parriott lease interests their shares of the cash, $9,000,000, less the amount thereof used to pay Tex-Penn debts. All these shares went to Benedum and Parriott who owned all the Tex-Penn stock. The deficiencies claimed by the Commissioner and the amounts determined by the Board rest upon the fact that Benedum and Parriott as the only stockholders of Tex- Penn became the owners of the 1,007,834 Transcontinental shares. And, as shown by the Board's findings, the balance of the cash without more went to Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather for their lease interests.\n  It is immaterial whether $30 was sufficient fully to compensate them for their Tex-Penn stock. The findings show the transfer was valid. Invalidating disparity between worth and consideration is not disclosed, and may not be assumed. Indeed, the Commissioner's brief states that Tex- Penn was organized to develop the leases which were the personal property of its five stockholders; it 'was not expected to operate at a profit * * * and actually it could not operate at a profit * * * It was useful chiefly in connection with the five-eighths royalties in the Duke-Knoles field held individually by its stockholders.' And respondents call attention to findings disclosing operating results that point in the same direction.\n  We find nothing in the circumstantial facts found or in the evidence to support the Board's conclusion that Kirkland, Lantz, and Wrather received from Transcontinental any cash for their stock in Tex-Penn. It cannot be sustained.\n  3. The Commissioner seeks reversal upon the grounds that the transaction was not a tax-exempt reorganization because Tex-Penn sought to realize a profit rather than merely to change the form of its ownership and that section 202(b) does not exempt from taxation exchanges of property for stock. Specifically he argues that, assuming that the Transcontinental stock was the sole \n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 498]\n\u00a0\n property exchanged for Tex-Penn assets, the transaction was not within the nonrecognition of gains provision. Concededly, this contention is contrary to the interpretation put upon section 202(b) by art. 1567 which was promulgated September 26, 1919 by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and has since been followed. \n4\n The parties presented their respective claims to the Board and to the lower court on the theory that, if neither Tex-Penn nor its stockholders as such received any cash from Transcontinental, the transaction would be within section 202(b). The Commissioner's notices of deficiency do not suggest the construction for which he now contends. He sought no ruling upon the question from the Board or the lower court and is therefore not entitled to have it decided here. Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378, 380\n, 270. The taxpayers were entitled to know the basis of law and fact on which the Commissioner sought to sustain the deficiencies. His failure earlier to present the question leaves this court without the assistance of decision below. \n5\n His petitions for these writs did not present the question to this court. We are not called on to consider the construction of section 202(b) now proposed. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[300 \nU.S. 481\n, 499]\n\u00a0\n  4. As the sole consideration to Tex-Penn was Transcontinental shares and as Kirkland, Lantz and Wrather received from Transcontinental no cash for their Tex-Penn stock, the transaction is within the nonrecognition of gains provisions. The judgments must therefore be affirmed.\n  5. The court is also of opinion that the judgments must be affirmed upon the ground that in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the shares of Transcontinental stock, regard being had to their highly speculative quality and to the terms of a restrictive agreement making a sale thereof impossible, did not have a fair market value, capable of being ascertained with reasonable certainty, when they were acquired by the taxpayers.\n  In the absence of such value, the ownership of the shares did not lay the basis for the computation of a gain at the time they were received, or for a tax as of that date under the applicable statute. Section 202(b). Treasury Regulations 45, art. 1563.\n  Affirmed.\n  Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n  Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs on the ground last stated in the opinion. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'In general, where two (or more) corporations unite their properties, by either (a) the dissolution of corporation B and the sale of its assets to corporation A, or (b) the sale of its property by B to A and the dissolution of B, or (c) the sale of the stock of B to A and the dissolution of B, or (d) the merger of B into A, or (e) the consolidation of the corporations, no taxable income is received from the transaction by A or B or the stockholders of either, provided the sole consideration received by B and its stockholders in (a), (b), (c), and (d) is stock or securities of A, and by A and B and their stockholders in (e) is stock or securities of the consolidated corporation, in any case of no greater aggregate par or face value than the old stock and securities surrendered . * * *' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The terms of the transfers were evidenced by two letters to Parriott accompanying delivery of the assignments.

Thompson   \n300 \nU.S. 258\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. L. M. Fischer, of Amarillo, Tex., for appellant.\n  Messrs. William Madden Hill, of Dallas, Tex., and William McCraw, of Austin, Tex., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 260]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question for decision is whether the prohibition by Texas of the use of sweet natural gas for the manufacture of carbon black in the Panhandle field is valid.\n  The suit is brought in the federal court for western Texas by the Henderson Company, a Maine corporation. It challenges the validity of the following provisions of chapter 120 of the Acts of the Legislature of Texas, 1935, Forth-Fourth Regular Session (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008), commonly known as House Bill 266: subdivisions (g) and (h) of section 2, which define sweet and sour gas;1 subdivision (j) of section 3, which prohibits the use of sweet gas for the manufacture of carbon black;2 and subdivision (1) of section 7, which defines the purposes for which sweet gas may be used. \n3\n See Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, \n300 \nU.S. 55\n, decided by this Court February 1, 1937. The suit challenges, also, the validity of orders entered by the Railroad Commission pursuant to the statute. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 261]\n\u00a0\n  The Henderson Company owns and operates in the Panhandle gas field a casinghead gasoline plant which is connected with 21 gas wells; holds oil and gas leases under which some of these wells are operated; and is under contract to take gas from the other wells. Prior to the statute, it received at its plant the gas from all these wells; extracted therefrom the gasoline content; and had contraced to supply the residue gas to the Combined Carbon Company. The orders challenged classified fourteen of the wells as sweet gas wells and prohibited both taking the gas therefrom for the purpose of processing the same for its gasoline content and delivery of the residue for the manufacture of carbon black. The seven remaining wells, classified as sour, cannot furnish the quantity of gas required by the company in its gasoline plant and to perform its contract with the Cabon Company. A supply from other sour gas wells is not available; and for the gas from the fourteen wells classified as sweet there is no other use.\n  The bill charges that the statute and the orders entered thereunder violate the Federal Constitution-the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Contract Clause (article 1,  10, cl. 1); also provisions of the Constitution of Texas. The members of the Commission and the Attorney General of Texas are made de- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 262]\n\u00a0\n fendants. The relief sought is to enjoin enforcement of the statute temporarily and permanently.\n  The jurisdiction, federal and equitable, was not questioned. Answers were filed. An application for a restraining order was denied. That for a preliminary injunction, promptly heard before three judges, was also denied (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 519. And on final hearing upon an extensive record a decree was entered denying the permanent injunction and dismissing the bill (D.C.) 14 F.Supp. 328. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed in compliance with Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 U. S.C.A. following section 723). The case is here on appeal.\n  The findings contain, as in Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, a description of the character and the development of the Panhandle gas field. In the western field the sweet gas zone lies to the south, occupying about two-thirds of it; the sour gas zone lies to the north and occupies about one-third. Plants which strip the gas of its gasoline content and carbon black plants which use the residue are apparently accessible to both zones. For those purposes either sweet or sour gas can be used. For the sweet gas of the Panhandle field there is also a large demand for fuel and light. For the sour gas in its natural state there is practically no use other than in the stripping and the carbon black plants. There are 29 carbon black plants in the Panhandle field. These produce more than 70 per cent. of all carbon black manufactured in the United States; and they consume, on the average, about 550,000,000 cubic feet per day. Intolerable waste had resulted by use of sweet gas under permits issued by the Railroad Commission under chapter 100, Acts 1933, Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session, which allowed the use of sweet gas for inferior purposes where there was no fuel and light market. It was primarily to prevent such waste that the Legislature prohibited by House Bill \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 263]\n\u00a0\n 266 the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black.\n  The court found, among other things:\n'There is enough sour gas in reserve in the Panhandle field to fulfill the world's requirements of carbon black for many years to come. There is also a tremendous supply of casinghead gas in the Panhandle field. There is now available for use in the manufacture of carbon black sufficient allotments under the orders of the Railroad Commission of sour and casinghead gas to supply all the demands and needs of such plants with an excess of 100,000,000 cubic feet of casinghead gas over and above the demand of the carbon black plants.\n\n'* * * A producer of sweet gas, if he is able to market the same for light and fuel purposes, receives about three or four cents per 1000 cubic feet in the field. When such gas is delivered at the burner tips it sells for various greater amounts. The producers of gas who sell to the companies who strip it and burn it for carbon black receive less than a cent per 1000 cubic feet.'\n\n  The company contends that our decision in Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 \nU.S. 300\n, which upheld certain action of Wyoming in prohibiting as wasteful the use of natural gas for the production of carbon black, is inapplicable to the issues here presented. The company concedes that Texas may, for the purpose of preventing waste, regulate both the production and the use of natural gas. It does not deny that when one natural resource is fitted for two uses and another resource only for one, the Legislature has the power to marshal these resources by classifying them, and designating the uses to which each may be put. Nor does it deny that the classification and the limitation of the use of sweet gas may 'when considering all of the gas fields in Texas as a whole, bear a reasonable relation to the purposes sought \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 264]\n\u00a0\n to be accomplished.' But it insists that as applied to the Panhandle field the classification and prohibition are void, because, there, they bear no reasonable relation to the object sought to be attained, and are arbitrarily discriminatory.\n  First. The contention that in the Panhandle field the prohibition of the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black is arbitrary and unreasonable rests primarily upon the fact that the sour and the sweet gas wells are in the same reservoir. The argument is that pressures in the sour gas area are lower than those in the sweet gas area; that, since there is no free market for sweet gas for fuel and light, it will, if not used in carbon black manufacture, and if withdrawals of sour gas are permitted to the extent of the requirements of the carbon black industry, migrate into lower pressure areas and become a part of the sour gas supply; that, therefore, the supply of sweet gas will not be conserved; and that the effect of the prohibition of its use in the manufacture of carbon black will be merely to deprive the company, through the migration, of the gas to which it is entitled. But the lower court found that the length of time required for such migration is not definitely known and that the demand for sweet gas for fuel and light is increasing. The needs of conservation are to be determined by the Legislature. See Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 \nU.S. 300, 324\n, 124. The loss of sweet gas by migration may be relatively negligible. The court concluded that there is 'an abundance of factual support for the legislative prohibition against the burning of sweet gas for carbon black.' No facts have been found, or established by the evidence, which would justify us in pronouncing the action of the Legislature arbitrary.\n  Second. The company insists, also, that the prescribed prohibition is void because the difference between sweet gas and sour is solely the presence in the latter of a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 265]\n\u00a0\n quantity of hydrogen sulphide; that by processing the sulphide can be eradicated from sour gas at a slight expense; and that the sour gas when so purified is fit for use for fuel and light. The distinction between sweet and sour gas fixed by the Legislature at 1 1\/2 grains of hydrogen sulphide per 100 cubic feet, is found by the court to be apt. The evidence as to the cost of purifying is widely conflicting. The cost might depend, among other things, upon the extent of the sulphur content. The classification made has ample support in the evidence. We are unable to find in the regulation anything arbitrary or unreasonable. Compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, Ann.Cas.1912C, 160; Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., supra, \n254 \nU.S. 300, 324\n, 124.\n  Third. The company contends that the provisions of the statute as applied discriminate unreasonably between it and other producers similarly situated. The statute applies equally to all sweet gas wells. The discrimination suggested is in favor of the sour gas well owners. The argument is that the company has now no fuel and light market for its sweet gas; that gas may drain into a sour well; and, if it does, will become sour and be usable in the manufacture of carbon black. It is not known when the expected drainage will occur. Long before that time there may be a fuel and light market for the company's sweet gas. It is also urged that the statute discriminates illegally by prohibiting the use of sweet gas in carbon black manufacture while permitting its use as fuel by manufacturers of other articles. There are several differences which would justify the classification. Among them, this: The daily average consumption of the 29 carbon black plants is only slightly less than the average daily amount taken by the pipe lines for fuel and light purposes. For the carbon black plants in the Panhandle field the sour gas there affords an ample supply. For the fuel uses served by the interstate pipe lines sweet gas is practically indispensable. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 266]\n\u00a0\n Compare Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana (No. 1), \n177 \nU.S. 190, 211\n; Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., supra, \n254 \nU.S. 300, 317\n, 322, 324, 123, 124.\n  Fourth. The company claims that the statute impairs the obligation of contracts, since it prohibits performance of the company's contracts with producers to take sweet gas for its stripping plant and its contract to deliver the residue after stripping to the Combined Carbon Company. The contention is that the contract clause of the Texas Constitution (article 1,  16), unlike that of the federal Constitution, prevents the State from enacting a police measure which will result in impairing a contract. In support of that proposition, the company cites Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Marshall, 124 Tex. 45, 76 S.W.(2d) 1007, 96 A.L.R. 802, decided by the Supreme Court of Texas in 1934. But that case does not support the proposition. The statute there held void was a moratorium statute specifically directed against the terms of contracts. The statute here challenged is not directed against any term of any contract. It deals merely with the use of an article of commerce; and its effect upon contracts is incidental. The distinction was pointed out by the district court, which said that the Constitution of the State of Texas 'has never been held to avoid a police statute dealing directly with physical things in the interest of the public welfare, and touching contractual relationships only incidentally as they may have attached to those physical things prior to the passage of the statute.' 14 F.Supp. 328, 334. That ruling accords with constitutional doctrine long established in this and other courts. If we felt any doubt as to its application here, in the absence of a definitive construction of the Constitution of the State by its highest court, we should defer to the federal court's understanding of the state law. See Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, \n300 \nU.S. 55\n, decided February 1, 1937.\n  Fifth. The contention that our decision in the Walls Case is inapplicable is rested in part on the difference, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 258\n, 267]\n\u00a0\n as to the title to gas in place, between the law of Wyoming and that of Texas. It is urged that, in the absence of waste, the legislature lacks power to regulate production in Texas, since there the law gives the owner of land title to the gas in place and to that which migrates to formations under his land; whereas in Wyoming regulation for the purpose of protecting correlative rights of other owners in a common pool is permissible. Upon this argument we need not pass. One principle established by the Walls Case is that the Legislature may, for the purpose of conserving natural resources, regulate their production and use. The findings of the district court in this case support the reasonableness of the present statute on that basis. It is also urged that there is this vital difference in the facts: that in the Panhandle field the challenged prohibition will not prevent waste, or conserve the supply of sweet gas, since the sweet gas, if not used, will drain into the sour gas area, because of the lower pressures there. Moreover, it is insisted that, unlike the Walls Case, there is here in the record convincing evidence that the use of sweet gas in the manufacture of carbon black is not wasteful. Our decision in that case rested upon no particular theory of the nature of the carbon black industry. It was based simply upon the determination that the statute in question was not shown to have been an arbitrary exercise of legislative power. Such, likewise, is our judgment here.\n  Affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 2. * * *\n'(g) The term 'sour gas' shall mean any natural gas containing more than one and one-half (1 1\/2) grains of hydrogen sulphide per one hundred ( 100) cubic feet or more than thirty (30) grains of total sulphur per one hundred (100) cubic feet, or gas which in its natural state is found by the Commission to be unfit for use in generating light or fuel for domestic purposes.\n\n'(h) The term 'sweet gas' shall mean all natural gas except 'sour gas' and 'casinghead gas.\"  \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 3.

SILAS MASON CO.(1937)\nNo. 418\nArgued: Decided: March 29, 1937\n\n\n  Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Washington. [ Henneford v. Silas Mason Co.   \n300 \nU.S. 577\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 578]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. R. G. Sharpe, of Olympia, Wash., for appellants.\n  Mr. B. H. Kizer, of Spokane, Wash., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A statute of Washington taxing the use of chattels in that state is assailed in this suit as a violation of the commerce clause (Constitution of the United States, art. 1,  8) in so far as the tax is applicable to chattels purchased in another state and used in Washington thereafter. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 579]\n\u00a0\n  Plaintiffs (appellees in this court) are engaged either as contractors or as subcontractors in the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia river. In the performance of that work they have brought into the state of Washington machinery, materials, and supplies, such as locomotives, cars, conveyors, pumps, and trestle steel, which were bought at retail in other states. The cost of all the articles with transportation expenses added was $921,189.34. Defendants, the Tax Commission of Washington (appellants in this court) gave notice that plaintiffs had become subject through the use of this property to a tax of $ 18,423.78, 2 per cent. of the cost, and made demand for payment. A District Court of three judges, organized in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 \nU.S.C.  380 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  380)), adjudged the statute void upon its face, and granted an interlocutory injunction, one judge dissenting. 15 F.Supp. 958. The case is here upon appeal. 28 \nU.S.C.  380 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  380).\n  Chapter 180, page 706 of the Laws of Washington for the year 1935, consisting of twenty titles, lays a multitude of excise taxes on occupations and activities. Only two of these taxes are important for the purposes of the case at hand, the 'tax on retail sales,' imposed by title 3, and the 'compensating tax,' imposed by title 4 on the privilege of use. Title 3 provides that after May 1, 1935, every retail sale in Washington, with a few enumerated exceptions, 1 shall be subject to a tax of 2 per cent. of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 580]\n\u00a0\n the selling price. Title 4, with the heading 'compensating tax,' provides ( sections 31, 35) that there shall be collected from every person in the state 'a tax or excise for the privilege of using within this state any article of tangible personal property purchased subsequent to April 30, 1935,' at the rate of 2 per cent. of the purchase price, including in such price the cost of transportation from the place where the article was purchased. If those provisions stood alone, they would mean that retail buyers within the state would have to pay a double tax, 2 per cent. upon the sale and 2 per cent. upon the use. Relief from such a burden is provided in another section (section 32) which qualifies the use tax by allowing four exceptions. Only two of these exceptions (b and c) call for mention at this time. \n2\n Subdivision (b) provides that the use tax shall not be laid unless the property has been bought at retail. Subdivision (c) provides that the tax shall nto \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 581]\n\u00a0\n apply to the 'use of any article of tangible personal property the sale or use of which has already been subjected to a tax equal to or in excess of that imposed by this title whether under the laws of this state or of some other state of the United States.' If the rate of such other tax is less than 2 per cent., the exemption is not to be complete (section 33), but in such circumstances the rate is to be measured by the difference.\n  The plan embodied in these provisions is neither hidden nor uncertain. A use tax is never payable where the user has acquired property by retail purchase in the state of Washington, except in the rare instances in which retail purchases in Washington are not subjected to a sales tax. On the other hand, a use tax is always payable where the user has acquired property by retail purchase in or from another state, unless he had paid a sales or use tax elsewhere before bringing it to Washington. The tax presupposes everywhere a retail purchase by the user before the time of use. If he has manufactured the chattel for himself, or has received it from the manufacturer as a legacy or gift, he is exempt from the use tax, whether title was acquired in Washington or elsewhere. The practical effect of a system thus conditioned is readily perceived. One of its effects must be that retail sellers in Washington will be helped to compete upon terms of equality with retail dealers in other states who are exempt from a sales tax or any corresponding burden. Another effect, or at least another tendency, must be to avoid the likelihood of a drain upon the revenues of the state, buyers being no longer tempted to place their orders in other states in the effort to escape payment of the tax on local sales. Do these consequences which must have been foreseen, necessitate a holding that the tax upon the use is either a tax upon the operations of interstate commerce or a discrimination against such commerce obstructing or burdening it unlawfully? \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 582]\n\u00a0\n  1. The tax is not upon the operations of interstate commerce, but upon the privilege of use after commerce is at an end.\n  Things acquired or transported in interstate commerce may be subjected to a property tax, nondiscriminatory in its operation, when they have become part of the common mass of property within the state of destination. Wiloil Corp. v. Com. of Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169, 175\n, 55 S. Ct. 358, 360, 79 L.Ed 838; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 575\n, 54 L.Ed 883; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500, 519\n; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 137. This is so, indeed, though they are still in the original packages. Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, supra; Woodruff v. Parham, supra. For like reasons they may be subjected, when once they are at rest, to a nondiscriminatory tax upon use or enjoyment. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 267\n, 349, 87 A.L.R. 1191; Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., \n289 \nU.S. 249, 252\n, 592; Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 578. The privilege of use is only one attribute, among many, of the bundle of privileges that make up property or ownership. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra; Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124, 136\n-138, 48; Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 678\n, 764. A state is at liberty, if it pleases, to tax them all collectively, or to separate the faggots and lay the charge distributively. Id. Calling the tax an excise when it is laid solely upon the use (Vancouver Oil Co. v. Henneford, 183 Wash. 317, 49 P.(2d) 14) does not make the power to impose it less, for anything the commerce clause has to say of its validity, than calling it a property tax and laying it on ownership. 'A nondiscriminatory tax upon local sales * * * has never been regarded as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce and has no greater or different effect upon that commerce than a general property tax to which all those enjoying the protection of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 583]\n\u00a0\n state may be subjected.' Eastern Air Transport, Inc., v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 147, 153\n, 341. A tax upon the privilege of use or storage when the chattel used or stored has ceased to be in transit is now an impost so common that its validity has been withdrawn from the arena of debate. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra; Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., supra; Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, supra. Cf. Vancouver Oil Co. v. Henneford, supra.\n  The case before us does not call for approval or disapproval of the definition of use or enjoyment in the rules of the Commission. Those rules inform us that 'property is put to use by the first act after delivery is completed within the state by which the article purchased is actually used or is made available for use with intent actually to use the same within the state. The term 'made a available for use' means and includes the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property preparatory to actual use within the state, such as keeping, storing, withdrawing from storage, moving, installing or performing any act by which dominion or control over the property is assumed by the purchaser.' A tax upon a use so closely connected with delivery as to be in substance a part thereof might be subject to the same objections that would be applicable to a tax upon the sale itself. If the rules are too drastic in that respect or others, the defect is unimportant in relation to this case. Here the machinery and other chattels subjected to the tax have had continuous use in Washington long after the time when delivery was over. The plaintiffs are not the champions of any rights except their own.\n  2. The tax upon the use after the property is at rest is not so measured or conditioned as to hamper the transactions of interstate commerce or discriminate against them.\n  Equality is the theme that runs through all the sections of the statute. There shall be a tax upon the use, but sub- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 584]\n\u00a0\n ject to an offset if another use or sales tax has been paid for the same thing. This is true where the offsetting tax became payable to Washington by reason of purchase or use within the state. It is true in exactly the same measure where the offsetting tax has been paid to another state by reason of use or purchase there. No one who uses property in Washington after buying it at retail is to be exempt from a tax upon the privilege of enjoyment except to the extent that he has paid a use or sales tax somewhere. Every one who has paid a use or sales tax anywhere, or, more accurately, in any state, is to that extent to be exempt from the payment of another tax in Washington.\n  When the account is made up, the stranger from afar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence of ownership than the dweller within the gates. The one pays upon one activity or incident, and the other upon another, but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed. Equality exists when the chattel subjected to the use tax is bought in another state and then carried into Washington. It exists when the imported chattel is shipped from the state of origin under an order received directly from the state of destination. In each situation the burden borne by the owner is balanced by an equal burden where the sale is strictly local. 'There is no demand in (the) Constitution that the state shall put its requirements in any one statute. It may distribute them as it sees fit, if the result, taken in its totality, is within the state's constitutional power.' Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472, 480\n, 634, 84 A.L.R. 831. If the sales tax were abolished, the buyer in Washington would pay at once upon the use. He would have no longer an offsetting credit. While the sales tax is in force, he pays upon the sale, and pays at the same rate. For the owner who uses after buying from afar the effect is all one whether his competitor is taxable under one title or another. This common sense conclusion has ample precedent behind it. Alabama laid a tax on \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 585]\n\u00a0\n the sale of spirituous liquors, the products of sister states. Comparing the tax with others applicable to domestic products, the court upheld the statute. The methods of collection were different, but the taxes were complementary and were intended to effect equality. Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148. Louisiana laid a tax in lieu of local taxes on rolling stock operated within the state, but belonging to corporations domiciled elsewhere. The court compared the tax with the local taxes upon residents, and found discrimination lacking. General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367, 372\n, 373, 235. South Carolina laid a tax on the storage of gasoline brought from other states and held for use in local business. The statute (Act S.C. April 4, 1930, 36 St. at Large, p. 1390) was interpreted by the state court, Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 164 S.E. 588, 593, as covering 'all gasoline stored for use and consumption upon which a like tax has not been paid under other statutes.' Upon comparison of all the statutes, the impost was upheld. The taxpayers had 'failed to show that, whatever distinction there existed in form, there was any substantial discrimination in fact.' Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, supra.\n  Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seeling, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511, 101\n A.L.R. 55, is invoked by appellees as decisive of the controversy, but the case is far apart from this one. There a statute of New York had made provision for a minimum price to be paid by dealers in milk to producers in that state. Cf. Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 89\n A.L.R. 1469; Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n. The same statute provided that when milk from another state had been brought into New York, the dealer should be prohibited from selling it at any price unless in buying the milk from the out-of-state producer he had paid the price that would be necessary if he had bought within the state. New York was attempting to project its legislation within the borders of another state by regulating the price to be paid in that state for milk acquired there. She said in effect to farmers in Vermont: Your milk cannot be sold by dealers to whom you ship it in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 586]\n\u00a0\n New York unless you sell it to them in Vermont at a price determined here. What Washington is saying to sellers beyond her borders is something very different. In substance what she says is this: You may ship your goods in such amounts and at such prices as you please, but the goods when used in Washington after the transit is completed, will share an equal burden with goods that have been purchased here.\n  We are told that a tax upon the use, even though not unlawful by force of its effects alone, is vitiated by the motives that led to its adoption. These motives cause it to be stigmatized as equivalent to a protective tariff. But motives alone will seldom, if ever, invalidate a tax that apart from its motives would be recognized as lawful. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 44\n, 601; Fox v. Standard Oil Co., \n294 \nU.S. 87, 100\n, 101, 338, 339. Least of all will they be permitted to accomplish that result when equality and not preference is the end to be achieved. Catch words and labels, such as the words 'protective tariff,' are subject to the dangers that lurk in metaphors an symbols, and must be watched with circumspection lest they put us off our guard. A tariff, whether protective or for revenue, burdens the very act of importation, and if laid by a state upon its commerce with another is equally unlawful whether protection or revenue is the motive back of it. But a tax upon use, or, what is equivalent for present purposes, a tax upon property after importation is over, is not a clog upon the process of importation at all, any more than a tax upon the income or profits of a business. The contention would be futile that Washington in laying an ownership tax would be doing a wrong to nonresidents in allowing a credit for a sales tax already borne by the owner as a result of the same ownership. To contend this would be to deny that a state may develop its scheme of taxation in such a way as to rid its exactions of unnecessary oppression. In the statute in dispute such a scheme has \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 587]\n\u00a0\n been developed with sedulous regard for every interest affected. Yet a word of caution should be added here to avoid the chance of misconception. We have not meant to imply by anything said in this opinion that allowance of a credit for other taxes paid to Washington made it mandatory that there should be a like allowance for taxes paid to other states. A state, for many purposes, is to be reckoned as a self-contained unit, which may frame its own system of burdens and exemptions without heeding systems elsewhere. If there are limits to that power, there is no need to mark them now. It will be time enough to mark them when a taxpayer paying in the state of origin is compelled to pay again in the state of destination. This statute by its framework avoids that possibility. The offsetting allowance has been conceded, whether the concession was necessary or not, and thus the system has been divested of any semblance of inequality or prejudice. A taxing act is not invalid because its exemptions are more generous than the state would have been free to make them by exerting the full measure of her power.\n  Finally, there is argument that the tax now in question, though in form upon the use, was in fact upon the foreign sale, and not upon the use at all, the form being a subterfuge. The supposed basis for that argument is a reading of the statute whereby the use shall not be taxable if the chattel was manufactured by the user or received as a legacy or acquired in any way except through the medium of purchase, and a retail one at that. But the fact that the Legislature has chosen to lay a tax upon the use of chattels that have been bought does not make the tax upon the use a tax upon the sale. One could argue with as much reason that there would be a tax upon the sale if a property tax were limited to chattels so acquired. A legislature has a wide range of choice in classifying and limiting the subjects of taxation. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 577\n, 588]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 313. The choice is as broad where the tax is laid upon one or a few of the attributes of ownership as when laid upon them all. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 158\n, 159, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312. True, collections might be larger if the use were not dependent upon a prior purchase by the user. On the other hand, economy in administration or a fairer distribution of social benefits and burdens may have been promoted when the lines were drawn as they were. Such questions of fiscal policy will not be answered by a court. The Legislature might make the tax base as broad or as narrow as it pleased.\n  The interlocutory injunction was erroneously granted, and the decree must be\n  Reversed.\n  Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 19.

LOWRY(1937)\nNo. 474\nArgued: February 8, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeals from the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. J. Walter Le Craw, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant claims his conviction in a state court deprived him of his liberty contrary to the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. He assigns as error the action of the Supreme Court of Georgia in overruling his claim and refusing him a discharge upon habeas corpus. The petition for the writ, presented to the superior court of Fulton county, asserted the appellant was unlawfully detained by the appellee as sheriff under the supposed authority of a judgment pronouncing him guilty of attempting to incite insurrection, as defined in section 56 of the Penal Code (Code 1933 ,  26-902), and sentencing him to imprisonment \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n for not less than eighteen nor more than twenty years. Attached were copies of the judgment and the indictment and a statement of the evidence upon which the verdict and judgment were founded. The petition alleged the judgment and sentence were void and appellant's detention illegal because the statute under which he was convicted denies and illegally restrains his freedom of speech and of assembly and is too vague and indefinite to provide a sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt, and further alleged that there had been no adjudication by any court of the constitutional validity of the statute as applied to appellant's conduct. A writ issued. The appellee answered, demurred specially to, and moved to strike, so much of the petition as incorporated the evidence taken at the trial. At the hearing the statement of the evidence was identified and was conceded by the appellee to be full and accurate. The court denied the motion to strike, overruled the special demurrer and an objection to the admission of the trial record, decided that the statute, as construed and applied in the trial of the appellant did not infringe his liberty of speech and of assembly, but ran afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment because too vague and indefinite to provide a sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt, and ordered the prisoner's discharge from custody. The appellee took the case to the Supreme Court of Georgia, assigning as error the ruling upon his demurrer, motion, and objection, and the decision against the validity of the statute. The appellant, in accordance with the state practice, also appealed, assigning as error the decision with respect to his right of free speech and of assembly. The two appeals were separately docketed, but considered in a single opinion which reversed the judgment on the appellee's appeal and affirmed on that of the appellant,1 concluding: 'Under \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n the pleadings and the evidence, which embraced the record on the trial that resulted in the conviction, the court erred, in the habeas corpus proceeding, in refusing to remand the prisoner to the custody of the officers.'\n The federal questions presented, and the manner in which they arise, appear from the record of appellant's trial and conviction embodied in the petition, and from the opinions of the state Supreme Court in the criminal proceeding.\n At the July term, 1932, of the superior court of Fulton county an indictment was returned charging against the appellant an attempt to induce others to join in combined resistance to the lawful authority of the state with intent to deny, to defeat, and to overthrow such authority by open force, violent means, and unlawful acts; alleging that insurrection was intended to be manifested and accomplished by unlawful and violent acts. The indictment specified that the attempt was made by calling and attending public assemblies and by making speeches for the purpose of organizing and establishing groups and combinations of white and colored persons under the name of the Communist Party of Atlanta for the purpose of uniting, combining, and conspiring to incite riots and to embarrass and impede the orderly processes of the courts and offering combined resistance to, and, by force and violence, overthrowing and defeating the authority of the state; that by speech and persuasion, the appellant solicited and attempted to solicit persons to join, confederate with, and become members of the Communist Party and the Young Communist League and introduced into the state and circulated, aided, and assisted in introducing and circulating, booklets, papers, and other writings with the same intent and purpose. The charge was founded on section 56 of the Penal Code, one of four related sections. Section 55 defines insurrection, section 56 defines an attempt to incite insurrection, section 57 prescribes the death \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n penalty for conviction of the offenses described in the two preceding sections unless the jury shall recommend mercy, and section 58 penalizes, by imprisonment, the introduction and circulation of printed matter for the purpose of inciting insurrection, riot, conspiracy, etc. The sections are copied in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant was brought to trial and convicted. He appealed on the ground that, under the statute as construed by the trial court in its instructions to the jury, there was no evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment upon a broader and different construction of the act. \n3\n The appellant moved for a rehearing contending, inter alia, that, as so construed, the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The court refused to pass upon the constitutional questions thus raised, elaborated and explained its construction of the statute in its original opinion, and de- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n nied a rehearing. \n4\n The appellant perfected an appeal to this court claiming that he had timely raised the federal questions and we, therefore, had jurisdiction to decide them. We held we were without jurisdiction. \n5\n Upon his commitment to serve his sentence he sought the writ of habeas corpus.\n In the present proceeding the Superior Court and Supreme Court of Georgia have considered and disposed of the contentions based upon the Federal Constitution. The scope of a habeas corpus proceeding in the circumstances disclosed is a state and not a federal question and since the state courts treated the proceeding as properly raising issues of federal constitutional right, we have jurisdiction and all such issues are open here. We must, then, inquire whether the statute as applied in the trial denied appellant rights safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The evidence on which the judgment rests consists of appellant's admissions and certain documents found in his possession. The appellant told the state's officers that some time prior to his arrest he joined the Communist Party in Kentucky and later came to Atlanta as a paid organizer for the party, his duties being to call meetings, to educate and disseminate information respecting the party, to distribute literature, to secure members, and to work up an organization of the party in Atlanta; and that he had held or attended three meetings called by him. He made no further admission as to what he did as an organizer, or what he said or did at the meetings. When arrested, he carried a box containing documents. After he was arrested, he conducted the officers to his room where additional documents and bundles of newspapers and periodicals were found, which \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n he stated were sent him from the headquarters of the Communist Party in New York. He gave the names of persons who were members of the organization in Atlanta, and stated he had only five or six actual members at the time of his apprehension. The stubs of membership books found in the box indicated he had enrolled more members than he stated. There was no evidence that he had distributed any of the material carried on his person and found in his room, or had taken any of it to meetings, save two circulars or appeals respecting county relief which are confessedly innocuous.\n The newspapers, pamphlets, periodicals, and other documents found in his room were, so he stated, intended for distribution at his meetings. These the appellee concedes were not introduced in evidence. Certain documents in his possession when he was arrested were placed in evidence. They fall into five classes: First, receipt books showing receipts of small sums of money, pads containing certificates of contributions to the Communist Party's Presidential Election Campaign Fund, receipts for rent of a post office box, and Communist Party membership books; secondly, printed matter consisting of magazines, pamphlets, and copies of the 'Daily Worker,' styled the 'Central Organ of the Communist Party,' and the 'Southern Worker,' also, apparently, an official newspaper of the party; thirdly, two books, one 'Life and Struggles of Negro Toilers,' by George Padmore, and the other 'Communism and Christianism Analyzed and Contrasted from the Marxian and Darwinian Points of View,' by Rt. Rev. William Montgomery Brown, D.D.; fourthly, transcripts of minutes of meetings apparently held in Atlanta; fifthly, two circulars, one of which was prepared by the appellant and both of which had been circulated by him in Fulton county. All of these may be dismissed as irrelevant except those falling within the first and second \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n groups. No inference can be drawn from the possession of the books mentioned, either that they embodied the doctrines of the Communist Party or that they represented views advocated by the appellant. The minutes of meetings contain nothing indicating the purposes of the organization or any intent to overthrow organized government; on the contrary, they indicate merely discussion of relief for the unemployed. The two circulars, admittedly distributed by the appellant, had nothing to do with the Communist Party, its aims or purposes, and were not appeals to join the party but were concerned with unemployment relief in the county and included appeals to the white and negro unemployed to organize and represent the need for further county aid. They were characterized by the Supreme Court of Georgia as 'more or less harmless.'\n The documents of the first class disclose the activity of the appellant as an organizer, but, in this respect, add nothing to his admissions.\n The matter appearing upon the membership blanks is innocent upon its face however foolish and pernicious the aims it suggests. Under the heading 'What is the Communist Party?' this appears:\n'The Party is the vanguard of the working class and consists of the best, most Class conscious, most active, the most courageous members of that class. It incorporates the whole body of experience of the proletarian struggle, basing itself upon the revolutionary theory of Marxism and representing the general and lasting interests of the whole of the working class, the Party personifies the unity of proletarian principles, of proletarian will and of proletarian revolutionary action.\n\n'We are the Party of the working class. Consequently, nearly the whole of that class (in time of war and civil war, the whole of that class) should work under the guidance of our Party, should create the closest contacts with our Party.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n This vague declaration falls short of an attempt to bring about insurrection either immediately or within a reasonable time, but amounts merely to a statement of ultimate ideals. The blanks, however, indicate more specific aims for which members of the Communist Party are to vote. They are to vote Communist for:\n\n'1. Unemployment and Social Insurance at the expense of the State and employers.\n\n'2. Against Hoover's wage-cutting policy.\n\n'3. Emergency relief for the poor farmers without restrictions by the government and banks; exemption of poor farmers from taxes and from forced collection of rents or debts.\n\n'4. Equal rights for the Negroes and self-determination for the Blank Belt.\n\n'5. Against capitalistic terror: against all forms of suppression of the political rights of the workers.\n\n'6. Against imperialist war; for the defense of the Chinese people and of the Soviet Union.'\n\n None of these aims is criminal upon its face. As to one, the fourth, the claim is that criminality may be found because of extrinsic facts. Those facts consist of possession by appellant of booklets and other literature of the second class illustrating the party doctrines. The state contends these show that the purposes of the Communist Party were forcible subversion of the lawful authority of Georgia. They contain, inter alia, statements to the effect that the party bases itself upon the revolutionary theory of Marxism, opposes 'bosses' wars,' approves of the Soviet Union, and desires the 'smashing' of the National Guard, the C.M.T. C., and the R.O.T.C. But the state especially relies upon a booklet entitled 'The Communist Position on the Negro Question,' on the cover of which appears a map of the United States having a dark belt across certain Southern states and the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n phrase 'Self-Determination for the Black Belt.' The booklet affirms that the source of the Communist Slogan 'Right of Self-Determination of the Negroes in the Black Belt' is a resolution of the Communist International on the Negro question in the United States adopted in 1930, which states that the Communist Party in the United States has been actively attempting to win increasing sympathy among the negro population, that certain things have been advocated for the benefit of the Negroes in the Northern states, but that in the Southern portion of the United States the Communist slogan must be 'The Right of Self-Determination of the Negroes in the Black Belt.' The resolution defines the meaning of the slogan as:\n'(a) Confiscation of the landed property of the white landowners and capitalists for the benefit of the negro farmers ... Without this revolutionary measure, without the agrarian revolution, the right of self- determination of the Negro population would be only a Utopia or, at best, would remain only on paper without changing in any way the actual enslavement.'\n\n'(b) Establishment of the State Unity of the Black Belt. ... If the right of self-determination of the Negroes is to be put into force, it is necessary wherever possible to bring together into one governmental unit all districts of the South, where the majority of the settled population consists of negroes. ...\n\n'(c) Right of Self-Determination. This means complete and unlimited right of the negro majority to exercise governmental authority in the entire territory of the Black Belt, as well as to decide upon the relations between their territory and other nations, particularly the United States. ... First of all, true right of self-determination means that the negro majority and not the white minority in the entire territory of the administratively \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 252]\n\u00a0\n united Black Belt exercises the right of administering governmental, legislative, and judicial authority. At the present time all this power is concentrated in the hands of the white bourgeoisie and landlords. It is they who appoint all officials, it is they who dispose of public property, it is they who determine the taxes, it is they who govern and make the laws. Therefore, the overthrow of this class rule in the Black Belt is unconditionally necessary in the struggle for the negroes' right to self- determination. This, however, means at the same time the overthrow of the yoke of American imperialism in the Black Belt on which the forces of the local white bourgeoisie depend. Only in this way, only if the negro population of the Black Belt wins its freedom from American imperialism even to the point of deciding itself the relations between its country and other governments, especially the United States, will it win real and complete self-determination. One should demand from the beginning that no armed forces of American imperialism should remain on the territory of the Black Belt.'\n\n Further statements appearing in the pamphlet are:\n'Even if the situation does not yet warrant the raising of the question of uprising, one should not limit oneself at present to propaganda for the demand 'Right to Self-Determination', but should organize mass actions, such as demonstration, strikes, tax boycott movements,' etc.\n\n'One cannot deny that it is just possible for the negro population of the Black Belt to win the right to self-determination during capitalism; but it is perfectly clear and indubitable that this is possible only through successful revolutionary struggle for power against the American bourgeoisie, through wresting the negroes' right of self-determination from American imperialism. Thus, the slogan of right to self-determination is a real slogan of National Rebellion which, to be considered as such, need \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 253]\n\u00a0\n not be supplemented by proclaiming struggle for the complete separation of the negro zone, at least not at present.'\n\n There is more of the same purport, particularly references to the 'revolutionary trade unions in the South,' 'revolutionary struggle against the ruling white bourgeoisie,' and 'revolutionary program of the Communist Party.'\n There is no evidence the appellant distributed any writings or printed matter found in the box he carried when arrested, or any other advocating forcible subversion of governmental authority. There is no evidence the appellant advocated, by speech or written word, at meetings or elsewhere, any doctrine or action implying such forcible subversion. There is evidence tending to prove that the appellant held meetings for the purpose of recruiting members of the Communist Party and solicited contributions for the support of that party and there is proof of the doctrines which that party espouses. Appellant's intent to incite insurrection, if it is to be found, must rest upon his procuring members for the Communist Party and his possession of that party's literature when he was arrested.\n Section 55 of the Georgia Penal Code defines insurrection as 'combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State, with intent to the denial thereof, when the same is manifested or intended to be manifested by acts of violence.' \n6\n The appellant was not indicted under this section. Section 58 denounces the introduction, printing, or circulation, or assisting to print or circulate any document 'for the purpose of inciting insurrection.' The appellant was not indicted under this section.\n Section 56, under which the indictment is laid, makes no reference to force or violence except by the phrase \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 254]\n\u00a0\n 'combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State.' The Supreme Court evidently importing from the similar phraseology in section 55 the additional element contained in that section, namely, 'manifested or intended to be manifested by acts of violence,' has decided that intended resort to force is an essential element of the offense defined by section 56.\n To ascertain how the act is held to apply to the appellant's conduct we turn to the rulings of the state courts in his case. The trial court instructed the jury: 'In order to convict the defendant, ... it must appear clearly by the evidence that immediate serious violence against the State of Georgia was to be expected or advocated.' The jury rendered a verdict of guilty. In the Supreme Court the appellant urged that the evidence was wholly insufficient to sustain the verdict under the law as thus construed. That court sustained the conviction by construing the statute thus:\n'Force must have been contemplated, but, as said above, the statute does not include either its occurrence or its imminence as an ingredient of the particular offense charged. ... Nor would it be necessary to guilt that the alleged offender \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 255]\n\u00a0\n should have intended that an insurrection should follow instantly or at any given time, but it would be sufficient that he intended it to happen at any time, as a result of his influence, by those whom he sought to incite.'7\n\n Upon application for rehearing the court further elaborated its views as to the meaning of the statute:\n'Force must have been contemplated, but the statute does not include either its occurrence or its imminence as an ingredient of the particular offense charged. Nor would it be necessary to guilt that the alleged offender should have intended that an insurrection should follow instantly or at any given time, but as to this element it would be sufficient if he intended that it should happen at any time within which he might reasonably expect his influence to continue to be directly operative in causing such action by those whom he sought to induce.'8\n\n The affirmance of conviction upon the trial record necessarily gives section 56 the construction that one who seeks members for or attempts to organize a local unit of a party which has the purposes and objects disclosed by the documents in evidence may be found guilty of an attempt to incite insurrection.\n The questions are whether this construction and application of the statute deprives the accused of the right of freedom of speech and of assembly guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and whether the statute so construed and applied furnishes a reasonably definite and ascertainable standard of guilt.\n The appellant, while admitting that the people may protect themselves against abuses of the freedom of speech safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment by prohibiting incitement to violence and crime insists that legislative regulation may not go beyond measures forefending against 'clear and present danger' of the use of force against the state. For this position he relies upon our decisions under the Federal Espionage Acts9 and cognate state legislation. These made it criminal willfully to cause or to attempt to cause, or incite or attempt to incite, insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States or willfully to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States or to con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 256]\n\u00a0\n spire for these purposes. We sustained the power of the government or a state to protect the war operations of the United States by punishing intentional interference with them. We recognized, however, that words may be spoken or written for various purposes and that willful and intentional interference with the described operations of the government might be inferred from the time, place, and circumstances of the act. 'The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The legislation under review differs radically from the Espionage Acts in that it does not deal with a willful attempt to obstruct a described and defined activity of the government.\n The state, on the other hand, insists that our decisions uphold state statute making criminal utterances which have a 'dangerous tendency' towards the subversion of government. It relies particularly upon Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, 45 S.Ct. 625. There, however, we dealt with a statute which, quite unlike section 56 of the Georgia Criminal Code, denounced as criminal certain acts carefully and adequately described. We said:\n'And a State may penalize utterances which openly advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of government of the United States and the several States, by violence or other unlawful means. ... \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 257]\n\u00a0\n 'By enacting the present statute the State has determined, through its legislative body, that utterances advocating the overthrow of organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized in the exercise of its police power. That determination must be given great weight. Every presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of the statute. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 8 S.Ct. 273. And the case is to be considered 'in the light of the principle that the State is primarily the judge of regulations required in the interest of public safety and welfare'; and that is police 'statutes may only be declared unconstitutional where they are arbitrary or unreasonable attempts to exercise authority vested in the State in the public interest.\" \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, at page 668, 45 S.Ct. 625, 630\n\n\n\n And it was in connection with the statute there involved that the court quoted language relied upon below and in argument here from People v. Lloyd, 304 Ill. 23, 136 N.E. 505, to the effect that a state is not compelled to delay adoption of such preventive measures until the apprehended danger becomes certain. Out of excess of caution the distinction was again clearly drawn between acts of the order of the Espionage Act and the New York act under review.\n'... when the legislative body has determined generally, in the constitutional exercise of its discretion, that utterances of a certain kind involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be punished, the question whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely, in and of itself, to bring about the substantive evil, is not open to consideration. It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that the use of the language comes within its prohibition.\n\n'It is clear that the question in such cases is entirely different from that involved in those cases where the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 258]\n\u00a0\n statute merely prohibits certain acts involving the danger of substantive evil, without any reference to language itself, and it is sought to apply its provisions to language used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the prohibited results. There, if it be contended that the statute cannot be applied to the language used by the defendant because of its protection by the freedom of speech or press, it must necessarily be found, as an original question, without any previous determination by the legislative body, whether the specific language used involved such likelihood of bringing about the substantive evil as to deprive it of the constitutional protection.' \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, at pages 670, 671, 45 S.Ct. 625, 631.\n\n It is evident that the decision sustaining the New York statute furnishes no warrant for the appellee's contention that under a law general in its description of the mischief to be remedied and equally general in respect of the intent of the actor, the standard of guilt may be made the 'dangerous tendency' of his words.\n The power of a state to abridge freedom of speech and of assembly is the exception rather than the rule and the penalizing even of utterances of a defined character must find its justification in a reasonable apprehension of danger to organized government. The judgment of the Legislature is not unfettered. The limitation upon individual liberty must have appropriate relation to the safety of the state. Legislation which goes beyond this need violates the principle of the Constitution. If, therefore, a state statute penalize innocent participation in a meeting held with an innocent purpose merely because the meeting was held under the auspices of an organization membership in which, or the advocacy of whose principles, is also denounced as criminal, the law, so construed and applied, goes beyond the power to restrict abuses of freedom \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 259]\n\u00a0\n of speech and arbitrarily denies that freedom. \n11\n And, where a statute is so vague and uncertain as to make criminal an utterance or an act which may be innocently said or done with no intent to induce resort to violence or on the other hand may be said or done with a purpose violently to subvert government, a conviction under such a law cannot be sustained. Upon this view we held bad a statute of California (Pen.Code,  403a) providing that 'any person who displays a red flag, ... in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on any house, building or window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government ... is guilty of a felony.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n After pointing out that peaceful agitation for a change of our form of government is within the guaranteed liberty of speech, we said of the act in question: 'A statute which upon its face, and as authoritatively construed, is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.' \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, at page 369, 51 S.Ct. 532, 536, 73 A.L.R. 1484.\n\n 1. \nThe appellant had a constitutional right to address meetings and organize parties unless in so doing he violated some prohibition of a valid statute. The only prohibition he is said to have violated is that of section 56 forbidding incitement or attempted incitement to insurrection by violence. If the evidence fails to show that he did so incite, then, as applied to him, the statute unreasonably limits freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and violates the Fourteenth Amendment. We are of opinion that the requisite proof is lacking. From what has been said above with respect to the evidence offered at \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 260]\n\u00a0\n the trial, it is apparent that the documents found upon the appellant's person were certainly, as to some of the aims stated therein, innocent and consistent with peaceful action for a change in the laws or the Constitution. The proof wholly fails to show that the appellant had read these documents; that he had distributed any of them; that he believed and advocated any or all of the principles and aims set forth in them, or that those he had procured to become members of the party knew or approved of any of these documents.\n Thus, the crucial question is not the formal interpretation of the statute by the Supreme Court of Georgia but the application given it. In its application the offense made criminal is that of soliciting members for a political party and conducting meetings of a local unit of that party when one of the doctrines of the party, established by reference to a document not shown to have been exhibited to any one by the accused, may be said to be ultimate resort to violence at some indefinite future time against organized government. It is to be borne in mind that the Legislature of Georgia has not made membership in the Communist Party unlawful by reason of its supposed dangerous tendency even in the remote future. The question is not whether Georgia might, in analogy to what other states have done, so declare. \n13\n The appellant induced others to become members of the Communist Party. Did he thus incite to insurrection by reason of the fact that they agreed to abide by the tenets of the party, some of them lawful, others, as may be assumed, unlawful, in the absence of proof that he brought the unlawful aims to their notice, that he approved them, or that the fantastic program \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 261]\n\u00a0\n they envisaged was conceived of by any one as more than an ultimate ideal? Doubtless circumstantial evidence might affect the answer to the question if appellant had been shown to have said that the Black Belt should be organized at once as a separate state and that that objective was one of his principal aims. But here circumstantial evidence is all to the opposite effect. The only objectives appellant is proved to have urged are those having to do with unemployment and emergency relief which are void of criminality. His membership in the Communist Party and his solicitation of a few members wholly fails to establish an attempt to incite others to insurrection. Indeed, so far as appears, he had but a single copy of the booklet the state claims to be objectionable; that copy he retained. The same may be said with respect to the other books and pamphlets, some of them of more innocent purport. In these circumstances, to make membership in the party and solicitation of members for that party a criminal offense, punishable by death, in the discretion of a jury, is an unwarranted invasion of the right of freedom of speech.\n\n 2. \nThe statute, as construed and applied in the appellant's trial, does not furnish a sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt. The act does not prohibit incitement to violent interference with any given activity or operation of the state. By force of it, as construed, the judge and jury trying an alleged offender cannot appraise the circumstances and character of the defendant's utterances or activities as begetting a clear and present danger of forcible obstruction of a particular state function. Nor is any specified conduct or utterance of the accused made an offense.\n The test of guilt is thus formulated by the Supreme Court of the state. Forcible action must have been contemplated, but it would be sufficient to sustain a con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 262]\n\u00a0\n viction if the accused intended that an insurrection 'should happen at any time within which he might reasonably expect his influence to continue to be directly operative in causing such action by those whom he sought to induce.' If the jury conclude that the defendant should have contemplated that any act or utterance of his in opposition to the established order or advocating a change in that order, might, in the distant future, eventuate in a combination to offer forcible resistance to the state, or, as the state says, if the jury believe he should have known that his words would have 'a dangerous tendency' then he may be convicted. To be guilty under the law, as construed, a defendant need not advocate resort to force. He need not teach any particular doctrine to come within its purview. Indeed, he need not be active in the formation of a combination or group if he agitate for a change in the frame of government, however peaceful his own intent. If, by the exercise of prophesy, he can forecast that, as a result of a chain of causation, following his proposed action a group may arise at some future date which will resort to force, he is bound to make the prophesy and abstain, under pain of punishment, possibly of execution. Every person who attacks existing conditions, who agitates for a change in the form of government, must take the risk that if a jury should be of opinion he ought to have foreseen that his utterances might contribute in any measure to some future forcible resistance to the existing government he may be convicted of the offense of inciting insurrection. Proof that the accused in fact believed that his effort would cause a violent assault upon the state would not be necessary to conviction. It would be sufficient if the jury thought he reasonably might foretell that those he persuaded to join the party might, at some time in the indefinite future, resort to forcible resistance of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 263]\n\u00a0\n government. The question thus proposed to a jury involves pure speculation as to future trends of thought and action. Within what time might one reasonably expect that an attempted organization of the Communist Party in the United States would result in violent action by that party? If a jury returned a special verdict saying twenty years or even fifty years, the verdict could not be shown to be wrong. The law, as thus construed, licenses the jury to create its own standard in each case. In this aspect what was said in United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, at page 89, 41 S.Ct. 298, 300, 14 A.L.R. 1045, is particularly apposite:\n'Observe that the section forbids no specific or definite act. It confines the subject-matter of the investigation which it authorizes to no element essentially inhering in the transaction as to which it provides. It leaves open, therefore, the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against. In fact, we see no reason to doubt the soundness of the observation of the court below in its opinion to the effect that, to attempt to enforce the section would be the exact equivalent of an effort to carry out a statute which in terms merely penalized and punished all acts detrimental to the public interest when unjust and unreasonable in the estimation of the court and jury.'\n\n The decisions relied on by the state held the Sherman Law (15 U.S.C.A .  1-7, 15 note) furnished a reasonable standard of guilt because it made a standard long recognized by the common law the statutory test. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The statute, as construed and applied, amounts merely to a dragnet which may enmesh any one who agitates for a change of government if a jury can be persuaded that he ought to have foreseen his words would have some \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 264]\n\u00a0\n effect in the future conduct of others. No reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt is prescribed. So vague and indeterminate are the boundaries thus set to the freedom of speech and assembly that the law necessarily violates the guarantees of liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER dissenting.\n I am of opinion that the Georgia statute, as construed and applied by the Supreme Court of the state of Herndon's Case, prescribes a reasonably definite and ascertainable standard by which to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and does not encroach on his right of freedom of speech or of assembly.\n It plainly appears, I think, that the offense defined in the statute, and of which Herndon was convicted, was not that of advocating a change in the state government by lawful means, such as an orderly exertion of the elective franchise or of the power to amend the State Constitution, but was that of attempting to induce and incite others to join in combined forcible resistance to the lawful authority of the state.\n Section 55, 56, and 57 of the Penal Code of Georgia1 deal with insurrection, attempts to incite insurrection, and the punishment therefor, and are so closely related that all evidently have a bearing on the scope and meaning of any one of them. Section 55 denounces insurrection and defines it as 'any combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State, with intent to the denial thereof, when the same is manifested or intended to be manifested by acts of violence.' Section 56 denounces \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 265]\n\u00a0\n an attempt of incite insurrection and defines it as 'any attempt, by persuasion or otherwise, to induce others to join in any combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State.' Section 57 prescribes the punishment for each of these offenses.\n While section 56 does not in direct terms include force or violence as a feature of the 'combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State' the attempt to induce which it denounces, the Supreme Court of the state has construed the section, doubtless by reason of its relation to the others, as making intended resort to force or violence an essential element of such 'combined resistance.' \n2\n Therefore the section must be taken as if expressly embodying this construction. It was under section 56 that Herndon was indicted, tried, and convicted.\n By the indictment he was charged with attempting to induce others to join in combined resistance to the lawful authority of the state 'by open force and by violent means, and by unlawful acts,' the modes of attempted inducement being specified. Upon the trial the court instructed the jury that neither 'possession of literature insurrectionary in its nature,' nor 'engaging in academic or philosophical discussion of abstract principles of economics or political or other subjects, however, radical or revolutionary in their nature,' would warrant a conviction; and that a verdict of guilt could not be given unless it clearly appeared from the evidence that 'immediate serious violence against the State' was expected or advocated by the accused.\n In affirming the conviction the Supreme Court of the state held that under the statute 'force must have been contemplated,' but that it is not necessary to guilt that the accused 'should have intended that an insurrection \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 266]\n\u00a0\n should follow instantly or at any given time, but it would be sufficient that he intended it to happen at any time, as a result' of his persuasion- the intent of the statute being 'to arrest at its incipiency any effort to overthrow the state government, where it takes the form of an actual attempt to incite others to insurrection.'\n Then, coming to consider the sufficiency of the evidence, the Supreme Court stated: 'From what has been said, the question here is simply this: Did the evidence show that the defendant made any attempt to induce others to come together in any combined forcible resistance to the lawful authority of the state?' And the court concluded its consideration of this question by saying, 'The jury were amply authorized to infer that violence was intended, and that the defendant did attempt to induce others to combine in such resistance to the lawful authority of the state' (Italics supplied.)3\n The accused sought a rehearing, largely because of his understanding of what was said in the court's opinion respecting the expected time of the intended resort to force. A rehearing was denied, and in that connection the court said:4\n'The language used by this court should be considered with the usual reasonable implications. The phrase 'at any time' as criticized in the motion for rehearing was not intended to mean at any time in the indefinite future, or at any possible later time, however remote. An activity now could hardly be expected to be the direct producing cause of an insurrection after the lapse of a great period of time, and it was not the purpose of this court to suggest that as to the mental requisite any such intent would be a sufficient ingredient of an attempt to incite an insurrection. On the contrary, the phrase 'at \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 267]\n\u00a0\n any time' was necessarily intended, and should have been understood, to mean within a reasonable time; that is, within such time as one's persuasion or other adopted means might reasonably be expected to be directly operative in causing an insurrection. Accordingly, the statements by this court as quoted in the motion for rehearing are to be accepted in the following sense: Force must have been contemplated, but the statute does not include either its occurrence or its imminence as an ingredient of the particular offense charged. Nor would it be necessary to guilt that the alleged offender should have intended that an insurrection should follow instantly or at any given time, but as to this element it would be sufficient if he intended that it should happen at any time within which he might reasonably expect his influence to continue to be directly operative in causing such action by those whom he sought to induce. This statement considered with what was said in the original decision represents the view of this court as to the proper construction of the statute under consideration, and under the statute as thus interpreted, we say, as before, that the evidence was sufficient to authorize the conviction. In view of what has been said above, it would seem that all contentions made in the motion for rehearing should necessarily fail, based, as they are, upon an erroneous construction of our decision.' ( Italics supplied.)\n\n It thus is made quite plain that the case proceeded from beginning to end, and in both state courts, upon the theory that the offense denounced by the statute and charged in the indictment was that of attempting to induce and incite others to join in combined forcible resistance to the lawful authority of the state; that the jury returned a verdict of guilty upon that the theory; and that it was upon the same theory that the Supreme Court held \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 268]\n\u00a0\n the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence, and affirmed the conviction.\n The present appeal is not from that judgment of affirmance, but from a judgment denying a subsequent petition for habeas corpus. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n If it be assumed that on this appeal the evidence produced on the trial in the criminal case may be examined to ascertain how the statute was applied, I am of opinion, after such an examination, that the statute was applied as if the words 'combined resistance' therein were in letter and meaning 'combined forcible resistance.'\n The evidence, all of which is embodied in the present record, will be here stated in reduced volume without omitting anything material.\n Herndon is a negro and a member of the Communist Party of the U.S.A., which is a section of the Communist International. He was sent from Kentucky to Atlanta, Ga., as a paid organizer for the party. Atlanta is within an area where there is a large negro population, and the Communist Party has been endeavoring to extend its activities and membership to that population among others. Herndon's duties as an organizer were to call and conduct meetings, to disseminate information respecting the party, to distribute its literature, to educate prospects and secure members, to receive dues and contributions, and to work up a subordinate organization of the party. He called and conducted meetings which evidently were secret, solicited and secured members, and received dues and contributions. He and others, when becoming members, subscribed to an obligation saying 'The undersigned declares his adherence to the program and statutes of the Communist International and the Communist Party of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 269]\n\u00a0\n U.S.A., and agrees to submit to the discipline of the party and to engage actively in its work.'\n When arrested, he had under his arm a box in which he was carrying membership and collection books which he had been using and various pamphlets, books and documents, all pertaining to the structure, purposes, and activities of the party. Two or three of the papers had been prepared by him and disclosed that he was an active spirit in the 'Section Committee' and the 'Unemployment Committee,' both subordinate local agencies of the party. The membership books, besides showing names of those whom he had induced to become members and dates of their admission, contained extracts from the party statutes, some of which read:\n'A member of the Party can be every person from the age of eighteen up who accepts the program and statutes of the Communist International and the Communist Party of the U.S.A., who becomes a member of a basic organization of the Party, who is active in this organization, who subordinates himself to all decisions of the Comintern and of the Party, and regularly pays his membership dues.'\n\n'The strictest Party Discipline is the most solemn duty of all Party members and all Party organizations. The decisions of the CI and the Party Convention of the CC and of all leading committees of the Party, must be promptly carried out. Discussion of questions over which there have been differences must not continue after the decision has been made.'\n\n'The Party is the vanguard of the working class and consists of the best, most class conscious, most active, the most courageous members of that class. It incorporates the whole body of experience of the proletarian struggle, basing itself upon the revolutionary theory of Marxism and representing the general and lasting interests of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 270]\n\u00a0\n whole of the working class. The Party personifies the unity of proletarian principles, of proletarian will and of proletarian revoluntionary action.'\n\n The collection books contained the statement 'Every dollar collected is a bullet fired into the boss class.'\n The membership and collection books had been sent to Herndon from the main office of the party in New York for use by him, and he had been using them in securing members and in collecting dues and contributions. With the exception of two or three papers prepared by him and heretofore mentioned, the literature which he was carrying under his arm when arrested had been sent to him from the same office, together with many pamphlets, books, and other publications, for use and distribution by him in his work as an organizer. The literature which he had with him when arrested was produced in evidence and will now be described, chiefly by titles and extracts (italics supplied).\n'Appeal to Southern Young Workers.'\n\n'The Young Communist League is the champion not only of the young white workers but especially of the doubly oppressed negro young workers. The Young Communist League fights against the whole system of race discrimination and stands for full racial, political, economic and social equality of all workers.\n\n'The chief aim of the Young Communist League is to organize the young workers for a struggle against the bosses and against the whole profit system. ...\n\n'The Young Communist League fights for: ...\n\n'Full political, social and racial equality for the negro workers.\n\n'Against bosses' wars!

They live under a perpetual regime of white terror. ... They are absolutely at the mercy of every fiendish mob incited by the white landlords and capitalists.'\n\n'Communism and Christianism.'\n\n'Banish the Gods from the Skies and Capitalists from the Earth and make the World safe for Industrial Communism. ...\n\n'The trouble with every reformatory socialism of modern times is, that it undertakes the impossibility of changing the fruit of the capitalist state into that of the communistic one, without changing the political organism; but to do that is as impossible as to gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles. Hence an uprooting and replanting are necessary (a revolution not a reformation) which will give the world a new tree of state.\n\n'Capitalism no longer grows the fruits (foods, clothes and houses) which are necessary to the sustenance of all the world. Hence it must be dug up by the roots in order that a tree which is so organized that it will bear these necessities for the whole world may be planted in its place.\n\n'The people of Russia have accomplished this uprooting and replanting ( this revolution) in the case of their state, and those of every nation are destined to do the same in one way or another, each according to its historical and economic development, some with much violence, most, I hope, with but little.'\n\n'Communist Position on the Negro Question.'\n\n This is a booklet of several pages and bears on the front of its cover a map of the United States showing a dark \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 272]\n\u00a0\n belt stretching across considerable portions of Georgia and eight other southern states. Parts of the text are here copied:\n'The slogan of the right of self-determination occupies the central place in the liberation struggle of the Negro population in the Black Belt against the yoke of American imperialism. But this slogan, as we see it, must be carried out only in connection with two other basic demands. Thus, there are three basic demands to be kept in mind in the Black Belt, namely, the following:\n\n'(a) Confiscation of the landed property of the white landowners and capitalists for the benefit of the negro farmers. The land property in the hands of the white American exploiters constitutes the most important material basis of the entire system of national oppression and serfdom of the Negroes in the Black Belt. More than three-quarters of all Negro farmers here are bound in actual serfdom to the farms and plantations of the white exploiters by the feudal system of 'share cropping'. ...\n\n'Without this revoluntionary measure, without the agrarian revolution, the right of self-determination of the Negro population would be only a Utopia, or, at best, would remain only on paper without changing in any way the actual enslavement.\n\n'(b) Establishment of the State Unity of the Black Belt. At the present time this Negro zone-precisely for the purpose of facilitating national oppression-is artificially split up and divided into a number of various states which include distant localities having a majority of white population. If the right of self-determination of the Negroes is to be put into force, it is necessary wherever possible to bring together into one governmental unit all districts of the South where the majority of the settled population consists of negroes. Within \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 273]\n\u00a0\n the limits of this state there will of course remain a fairly significant white minority which must submit to the right of self-determination of the negro majority. ...\n\n'(c) Right of Self-Determination. This means complete and unlimited right of the negro majority to exercise governmental authority in the entire territory of the Black Belt, as well as to decide upon the relations between their territory and other nations, particularly the United States'. ...\n\n'Even if the situation does not yet warrant the raising of the question of uprising, one should not limit oneself at present to propaganda for the demand, 'Right to Self-Determination,' but should organize mass actions, such as demonstrations, strikes, tax boycott movements, etc.' ...\n\n'A direct question of power is also the demand of confiscation of the land of the white exploiters in the South, as well as the demand of the negroes that the entire Black Belt be amalgamated into a State unit.\n\n'Hereby, every single fundamental demand of the liberation struggle of the negroes in the Black Belt is such that-if once thoroughly understood by the negro masses and adopted as their slogan-it will lead them into the struggle for the overthrow of the power of the ruling bourgeoisie, which is impossible without such revoluntionary struggle. One cannot deny that it is just possible for the negro population of the Black Belt to win the right to self-determination during capitalism; but it is perfectly clear and indubitable that this is possible only through successful revoluntionary struggle for power against the American bourgeoisie, through wresting the negroes' right of self-determination from American imperialism. Thus, the slogan of right to self-determination is a real slogan of National Rebellion which, to be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 274]\n\u00a0\n considered as such, need not be supplemented by proclaiming struggle for the complete separation of the negro zone, at least not at present.\n\n'(d) Communists must fight in the forefront of the national liberation movement and must do their utmost for the progress of this mass movement and its revoluntionization. Negro Communists must clearly disssociate themselves from all bourgeois currents in the negro movement, must indefatigably oppose the spread of the influence of the bourgeois groups on the working negroes.' ...\n\n'Their constant call to the negro masses must be: Revoluntionary struggle against the ruling white bourgeoisie, through a fighting alliance with the revolutionary white proletariat! ...\n\n'We are Bolsheviks, members of a fighting Party of the working class, who know that the only road to the revoluntionary overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of Communism is through welding together the iron unity of class idealogy which penetrates into our ranks, as the prerequisite to the effective struggle against the class enemy physically.'\n\n There was no direct testimony that Herndon distributed the literature just described. No member of the Communist Party came forward to tell what he did in their meetings or in inducing them to become members. Nor does this seem strange when regard is had to the obligation taken by members and to the discipline imposed. Nevertheless there was evidence from which distribution by him reasonably could be inferred. It was shown that he was an active member, was sent to Atlanta as a paid organizer, and was subject to party discipline; also that he received the literature for distribution in the course of his work and had copies of it, together with cur- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 275]\n\u00a0\n rent membership and collection books, under his arm when he was arrested; and further that he had been soliciting and securing members, which was part of the work in which the literature was to be used. He had declared his 'adherence to the program and statutes' of the party and had taken like declarations from those whom he secured as members; and this tended strongly to show not only that he understood the party program and statutes as outlined in the literature, but also that he brought them to the attention of others whom he secured as members. Besides, at the trial he made an extended statement to the court and jury in his defense,6 but did not refer in any wise to the literature or deny that he had been using or distributing it. Thus there was in the evidence not merely some but adequate and undisputed basis for inferring that he had been using the literature for the purposes for which he received it. Evidently, and with reason, the jury drew this inference.\n It should not be overlooked that Herndon was a negro member and organizer in the Communist Party and was engaged actively in inducing others, chiefly southern negroes, to become members of the party and participate in effecting its purposes and program. The literature placed in his lands by the party for that purpose was particularly adapted to appeal to negroes in that section, for it pictured their condition as an unhappy one resulting from asserted wrongs on the part of white landlords and employers, and sought by alluring statements of resulting advantages to induce them to join in an effort to carry into effect the measures which the literature proposed. These measures included a revolutionary uprooting of the existing capitalist state, as it was termed; confiscation of the landed property of white landowners and capitalists for the benefit of negroes; es- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 276]\n\u00a0\n tablishment in the black belt of an independent state, possibly followed by secession from demonstrations, strikes, and tax boycotts in aid of this measure; adoption of a fighting the United States; organization of mass alliance with the revolutionary white proletariat; revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and establishment of Communism through effective physical struggles against the class enemy. Proposing these measures was nothing short of advising a resort to force and violence, for all know that such measures could not be effected otherwise. Not only so, but the literature makes such repelling use of the terms 'revolution,' 'national rebellion,' 'revolutionary struggle,' 'revolutionary overthrow,' 'effective physical struggle,' 'smash the National Guard,' 'mass strikes,' and 'violence,' as to leave no doubt that the use of force in an unlawful sense is intended.\n The purpose and probable effect of such literature, when under consideration in a prosecution like that against Herndon, are to be tested and determined with appropriate regard to the capacity and circumstances of those who are sought to be influenced. \n7\n In this instance the literature is largely directed to a people whose past and present circumstances would lead them to give unusual credence to its inflaming and inciting features.\n And so it is that examination and consideration of the evidence convince me that the Supreme Court of the state applied the statute, conformably to its opinion, as making criminal an attempt to induce and incite others to join in combined forcible resistance to the lawful authority of the state.\n That the constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech and assembly does not shield or afford protection for acts of intentional incitement to forcible resistance to the lawful authority of a state is settled by repeated deci- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 277]\n\u00a0\n sions of this Court;8 and the Georgia decisions are to the same effect. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Under the statute as construed and applied, it is essential that the accused intended to induce combined forcible resistance. The presence of the intent aggravates the inducement and brings it more certainly within the power of the state to denounce it as a crime than otherwise it would be. The Supreme Court of the state in both of its opinions was dealing with a statute and a charge in which the intent of the accused was an element of the offense. In the original opinion the court incautiously said 'it would be sufficient that he intended it (the combined and forcible resistance) to happen at any time.' In its opinion on rehearing it said the phrase 'at any time' had not been intended to mean any time in the indefinite future; and by way of avoiding such a meaning the court changed that part of the original opinion by making it read 'at any time within which he might reasonably expect his influence to continue to be directly operative in causing such action by those whom he sought to induce.' I do not perceive that this puts the standard of guilt at large or renders it inadmissibly vague. The accused must intend that combined forcible resistance shall proximately result from his act of inducement. There is no uncertainty in that. The intended point of time must be within the period during which he 'might reasonably expect' his inducement to remain directly operative in causing the combined forcible resistance. The words 'might reasonably expect' have as much precision as is admissible in such a matter, are not \n\n[301 \nU.S. 242, 278]\n\u00a0\n difficult to understand, and conform to decisions heretofore given by this Court in respect of related questions. \n10\n I therefore am of opinion that there is no objectionable uncertainty about the standard of guilt and that the statute does not in that regard infringe the constitutional guaranty of due process of law.\n Believing that the statute under which the conviction was had is not subject to the objections leveled against it, I think the judgment of the Supreme Court of the state denying the petition for habeas corpus should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 182 Ga. 582, 186 S.E. 429, 430. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] '55.

Gibson, of Richmond, Va., and John S. Barbour, of Fairfax, Va., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A statute of Virginia, known as the 'Milk and Cream Act,' is assailed by the appellants as invalid both under the Constitution of Virginia and under that of the United States.\n  The act is chapter 357 of the Acts of 1934. It recites the existence of demoralizing trade practices in the dairy industry, threatening to interrupt the supply of pure and wholesome milk for the inhabitants of the Commonwealth and producing an economic emergency so acute and destructive as to call for corrective measures. It establishes \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 610]\n\u00a0\n a milk commission with power to crete within the state natural market areas, and to fix the minimum and maximum prices to be charged for milk and cream therein. It authorizes the commission to exact a license from distributors subject to the act, and provides that in the absence of such a license sales shall be unlawful within the market areas. It imposes taxes or fees for the support of the commission and of local milk boards which are to be created to co-operate with the commission in making the plan effective. It warns (section 14) that none of its provisions 'shall apply or be construed to apply to foreign or interstate commerce, except in so far as the same may be effective pursuant to the United States Constitution and to the laws of the United States enacted pursuant thereto.' Finally it provides (section 16) that, 'if any section, clause, or sentence or paragraph shall be declared unconstitutional for any reason, the remainder of the act shall not be affected thereby.' A fuller summary of the statute is given in the opinion of the court below ((D.C.) 16 F. Supp. 575), to which reference is made. Other provisions will be noted in this opinion later.\n  The suit is for an injunction to restrain the members of the commission from enforcing the statute or the regulations made thereunder. One of the two plaintiffs (Highland Farms Dairy, Incorporated), which will be spoken of as 'Highland,' has a creamery for the pasteurizing and treatment of milk at Washington in the District of Columbia. For that purpose it buys milk from farmers in Virginia and Maryland. Its entire output of bottled milk it sells to the other plaintiff, Luther W. High, who has retail stores in Virginia and elsewhere for the sale of ice cream, milk and other dairy products. A regulation adopted by the commission on March 27, 1936, set up a market area, described as the Arlington- Alexandria Milk Market, within which High is engaged in business. Mini- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 611]\n\u00a0\n mum prices prescribed for that area are in excess of the prices at which Highland had been selling to High and at which High had sold to the consumers. Each went on selling at the old prices. Neither made application for a license. In June, 1936, the commission gave notice to High that it would proceed against him for an injunction if he refused compliance with its orders. No proceedings against Highland were begun or even threatened, the commission taking the position that Highland was not subject to the prohibitions of the statute, its sales and purchases in Virginia being transactions in interstate commerce. In spite of this disclaimer, Highland joined with High in suing to enjoin the enforcement of the act. A District Court of three judges, organized in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 \nU.S.C.  380 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  380)), gave judgment for the defendants, with a comprehensive opinion to which little can be added. 16 F.Supp. 575. The case is here upon appeal. 28 \nU.S. C.  380 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  380).\n  The power of a state to fix a minimum price for milk in order to save producers, and with them the consuming public, from price cutting so destructive as to endanger the supply, was affirmed by this Court in Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 89\n A.L.R. 1469, and in other cases afterwards. Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 251\n. Appellants are not asking us to undo what was there done. They take the ground, however, that the statute of Virginia is open to objections that were inapplicable to the statute of New York. The present grounds of criticism will be considered one by one.\n  1. The statute is not invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\n  The General Assembly of the Commonwealth in setting up the Milk Commission did not charge it with a duty to prescribe a scale of prices in every portion of the state. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 612]\n\u00a0\n The commission was to establish market areas, and with reference to each area was to determine, after a public hearing, whether there was need within such area that prices should be regulated. If it was satisfied of the need, it was to fix a scale accordingly. The argument for the appellants is that in this there was a grant of discretionary power overpassing the limits of lawful delegation.\n  The Constitution of the United States in the circumstances here exhibited has no voice upon the subject. The statute challenged as invalid is one adopted by a state. This removes objections that might be worthy of consideration if we were dealing with an act of Congress. How power shall be distributed by a state among its governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a question for the state itself. Nothing in the distribution here attempted supplies the basis for an exception. The statute is not a denial of a republican form of government. Constitution, art. 4,  4. Even if it were, the enforcement of that guarantee, according to the settled doctrine, is for Congress, not the courts. Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n; State of Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565, 36\n S.cT. 708; State of Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74, 79\n, 80, 50 S. Ct. 228, 230, 66 A.L.R. 1460. Cases such as Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, and Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 97\n A.L.R. 947, cited by appellants, are quite beside the point. What was in controversy there was the distribution of power between President and Congress, or between Congress and administrative officers or commissions, a controversy affecting the structure of the national government as established by the provisions of the national Constitution.\n  So far as the objection to delegation is founded on the Constitution of Virginia, it is answered by a decision of the highest court of the state. In Reynolds v. Milk Commission, 163 Va. 957, 179 S.E. 507, the Supreme Court of Appeals passed upon the validity of the statute now in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 613]\n\u00a0\n question. The commission sued distributors to enjoin them from selling milk at a price lower than the prescribed minimum, and the injunction was granted against the defendants' objection that the statute was invalid. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals the judgment was affirmed. To escape the force of that decision the argument is made that the question of unlawful delegation was not considered or decided. But the contrary is plainly indicated both in the opinion of the court and in that of its dissenting members. The prevailing opinion summarizes the arguments against the act, and among them is this (163 Va. 957, at page 976, 179 S.E. 507, 514), that there is 'the delegation to the commission of the power to enact legislation which is both prohibitory and penal in character and which will be operative only in such milk areas as the commission may define.' The dissenting opinion says (163 Va. 957, at page 980, 179 S.E. 507, 516): 'The commission may order milk to be sold at one price in Staunton, at another in Harrisonburg, and may leave Woodstock to shift for itself.' These statements are too clear to leave room for misconstruction. A judgment by the highest court of a state as to the meaning and effect of its own Constitution is decisive and controlling everywhere.\n  2. The statute is not invalid in its present application by reason of a provision for the cancellation of the prices established for a market, if cancellation is requested by a majority of the producers and distributors in the area affected. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n  The argument is made that the effect of that provision is to vest in unofficial agencies, capriciously selected, a power of repeal to be exercised at pleasure. The case \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 614]\n\u00a0\n of Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 42\n L.R.A.( N.S.) 1123, Ann.Cas.1914B, 192, is cited for the proposition that this cannot be done consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Delegation to official agencies is one thing, there being nothing in the concept of due process to require that a particular agency shall have a monopoly of power; delegation to private interests or unofficial groups with arbitrary capacity to make their will prevail as law may be something very different. Cf., however, Cusack Co. v. City of Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 531\n, L.R.A.1918A, 136, Ann.Cas.1917C, 594. Such is the appellants' argument when its implications are developed.\n  Without acceptance or rejection of the distinction in its application to this statute, we think it is enough to say that the power of cancellation has not been exercised or even threatened. The controversy in that regard is abstract and conjectural. Abrams v. Van Schaick, \n293 \nU.S. 188\n. Moreover, if a provision so subordinate were at any time to fail, the saving clause in section 16 would cause the residue to stand.\n  3. The statute does not lay a burden on interstate commerce.\n  Argument to the contrary is built upon the definition of the word 'distributor' contained in section 1. We learn from that section that distributors include 'persons wherever located or operating, whether within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, who purchase, market, or handle milk for resale as fluid milk in the Commonwealth of Virginia.' This definition, we are told, takes in the plaintiff Highland, who buys milk and sells it in interstate commerce, and does so with the expectation that upon arrival in Virginia the milk will be resold. But Highland is not subject to the provisions of the act, and so the Milk Commission has ruled. No matter what the definition of a distributor may be, sales are not affected by any restriction as to price unless made \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 615]\n\u00a0\n within the boundaries of a designated market area. The sections quoted in the margin point fairly to that conclusion. \n2\n Highland land in Washington may sell to High in Virginia, and High may buy from Highland, at any price they please. not till the milk is resold in Virginia within a market area will the price minimum apply, and then only to the price to be charged on the resale. Cf. Wiloil Corp. v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169, 175\n, 360; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n; Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511, 101\n A.L.R. 55. If there could be any doubt about this as a matter of construction, the doubt would be dispelled by the administrative practice and by the warning of the statute, expressed in section 14, that operations in interstate commerce shall not be deemed to be affected. So \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 616]\n\u00a0\n also as to the requirement of a license expressed in section 4.3 High needs a license to the extent that he sells at retail to consumers in Virginia. Highland does not need one, and the commission is not asking it to apply for one, because its business as now conducted with persons in Virginia is interstate exclusively. Clumsy draftsmanship may have spread a fog about the section when viewed in isolation or taken from its setting. The fog scatters when we recall the provisions of section 14 and the administrative practice. Appellants' fears are visionary.\n  4. The statute is not invalid for failing to prescribe the standards to be applied by the commission in granting licenses or refusing them.\n  The obvious purpose of the license is to provide the commission and the members of the local boards with a record of the distributors and producers subject to the act. Supervision and enforcement are thus likely to be easier. No inference is permissible that any one was intended to be excluded because of favor or caprice. People of State of New York ex rel. Lieberman v. Van De Carr, \n199 \nU.S. 552\n. Indeed the statute makes provision (section 6) that an order refusing to issue a license, or suspending or revoking one, may be reviewed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals. There is sedulous protection against oppression or abuse of power. One who is required to take out a license will not be heard to complain, in advance of application, that there is danger of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 608\n, 617]\n\u00a0\n refusal. Lehon v. Atlanta, \n242 \nU.S. 53, 56\n; Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 585. He should apply and see what happens.\n  Other arguments against the act are implicit in the arguments already summarized and answered. Expansion of the answer will serve no useful purpose.\n  The decree is affirmed.\n  Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER do not assent to so much of the opinion as attributes to the state a power to fix minimum and maximum prices to be charged in the sale of milk, their views on this question being reflected by what was said on their behalf oby Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS in Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 539\n-559, 516, 525, 89 A.L.R. 1469. In other respects they concur in the opinion. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision (section 3(i) reads as follows: 'The commission shall withdraw the exercise of its powers from any market upon written application of a majority of the producers (measured by volume) of milk produced and a majority of the distributors (measured by volume of milk distributed) in said market acting jointly.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3, subd. j: 'The commission, after public hearing and investigation, may fix the prices to be paid producers and\/or associations of producers by distributors in any market or markets, may fix the minimum and maximum wholesale and retail prices to be charged for milk in any market, and may also fix different prices for different grades of milk. In determining the reasonableness of prices to be paid or charged in any market or markets for any grade, quantity, or class of milk, the commission shall be guided by the cost of production and distribution, including compliance with all sanitary regulations in force in such market or markets, necessary operation, processing, storage and delivery charges, the prices of other foods, and the welfare of the general public.'\n  Section 3, subd. k: 'The commission may require all distributors in any market designated by the commission to be licensed by the commission for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act. The commission may decline to grant a license, or may suspend or revoke a license already granted upon due notice and after a hearing. The commission may classify licenses, and may issue licenses to distributors to process or store or sell milk to a particular city or village or to a particular market or markets within the Commonwealth.'\n  Section 1, par. 2: \"Market' means any city, town or village of the Commonwealth, or two or more cities and\/or towns and\/or villages and surrounding territory designated by the commission as a natural marketing area.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The section reads as follows: 'No distributor in a market in which the provisions of this act are in effect shall buy milk from producers, or others, for sale within the Commonwealth, or sell or distribute milk within the Commonwealth, unless such distributor is duly licensed under the provisions of this act. It shall be unlawful for a distributor to buy milk from or sell milk to a distributor who is not licensed as required by this act. It shall be unlawful for any distributor to deal in, or handle milk if such distributor has reason to believe it has previously been dealt in, or handled, in violation of the terms and provisions of this act.' \n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHILL V. UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 171\nArgued: January 11, 1937Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n  Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and John Dickinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n  Mr. Seth W. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The relator, Weiner, was convicted in a federal District Court for violating a decree entered against him and numerous others by that court in a suit in equity brought by the United States under the Sherman Anti- Trust Act, Title 15 \nU.S.C.  1, 2, 4 (15 \nU.S.C.A.  1, 2, 4). He, with others, was charged [ Hill v. United States   \n300 \nU.S. 105\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 105\n, 106]\n\u00a0\n\nby information with the commission of several specified acts in violation of the decree, constituting criminal contempts. Upon a trial before the court sitting without a jury, he was found guilty and sentenced for certain of the contempts to imprisonment for six months in the House of Detention, and for other contempts for two years additional in the penitentiary. Upon his application and consent, the first part of the sentence was increased from six months in the House of Detention to a year and a day in the penitentiary, but to run concurrently with the two years' imprisonment.\n  On June 5, 1935, he was committed to the penitentiary. At the end of eleven months, he applied by petition to another federal District Court to be discharged on habeas corpus, on the ground that the first court was without power to sentence him for a period of more than six months; and, having served that long, that he was entitled to be set at liberty.\n  The District Court accepted that view, granted the writ, and ordered the relator discharged. 11 F.Supp. 195. Upon appeal, the court below affirmed the order. (C.C.A.) 84 F.(2d) 27.\n  The case involves a consideration of sections 21, 22, and 24 of the Clayton Act, Title 28 \nU.S.C.  386, 387, and 389 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  386, 387, 389).1 Section 21, so far as pertinent, provides that any person who shall willfully disobey any lawful decree of the federal District Court by doing any act or thing thereby forbidden to be done by him, if of a character to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute \n\n[300 \nU.S. 105\n, 107]\n\u00a0\n of the United States or laws of any state in which the act was committed, shall be proceeded against as thereafter provided. Section 22 provides for trial by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury. If found guilty, punishment is to be either by fine or imprisonment or both, in the discretion of the court, 'but in no case shall the fine to be paid to the United States exceed, in case the accused is a natural person, the sum of $ 1,000, nor shall such imprisonment exceed the term of six months.' Section 24, however, provides that 'nothing herein contained ( 21, 22, 23, 25 ( in sections 386 to 388 and 390 of this title)) shall be construed to relate to contempts * * * committed in disobedience of any lawful * * * decree * * * entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf \n\n[300 \nU.S. 105\n, 109]\n\u00a0\n in the matter of punishment so arbitrary as to deny due process of law to relator. Whatever may be the restraint against discriminatory legislation imposed by the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment, it is not encountered by the legislation here. The constitutional power of Congress to prescribe greater punishment for an offense involving the rights and property of the United States than for a like offense involving the rights or property of a private person reasonably cannot be doubted. Compare Pace v. Alabama, \n106 \nU.S. 583\n.\n  Judgment reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 21. Any person who shall willfully disobey any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any district court of the United States or any court of the District of Columbia by doing any act or thing therein, or thereby forbidden to be done by him, if the act or thing so done by him be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States or under the laws of any State in which the act was committed shall be proceeded against for his said contempt as hereinafter provided. (Title 28 \nU.S.C.  386 (28 \nU.S.C.A .  386)).\n  Sec. 22. * * * In all cases within the purview of this Act (sections 381 to 383, 386 to 390 of this title, section 412 of Title 18, section 52 of Title 29 and sections 12 to 27 of Title 15), such trial may be by the court, or, upon demand of the accused, by a jury. * * * \n  If the accused be found guilty, judgment shall be entered accordingly, prescribing the punishment, either by fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court. Such fine shall be paid to the United States or to the complainant or other party injured by the act constituting the contempt, or may, where more than one is so damaged, be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct, but in no case shall the fine to be paid to the United States exceed, in case the accused is a natural person, the sum of $1,000, nor shall such imprisonment exceed the term of six months. (Title 28 U.S.C.  387 (28 U.S.C.A.  387)).\n  Sec. 24. Nothing herein contained (that is in  21, 22, 23, 25 ( sections 386 to 388 and 390 of this title)) shall be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within section twenty-one of this Act ( section 386 of this title), may be punished in conformity to the usages at law and in equity prevailing on October 15, 1914. (Title 28 U.S.C.  389 ( 28 U.S.C.A.  389)).\n of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within section twenty-one (section 386 of this title ), may be punished in conformity to the usages at law and in equity prevailing on October 15, 1914.' If section 24 applies, the sentence was within the statutory authority of the court.\n  First. The court below held, and relator here contends, that the limitation of imprisonment to six months is not affected by the provisions of section 24. A similar question was before this Court in United States v. Goldman, \n277 \nU.S. 229, 489\n, and was there decided contrary to the views of the court below. In that case, an information was presented by the United States to a federal District Court, charging Goldman and others with criminal contempts committed by acts in violation of an injunction decreed by that court in an equity suit brought by the United States. The information was dismissed on the ground that under section 25 of the Clayton Act (28 U.S.C.A.  390), the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. This Court reversed. Section 25 provides that no proceeding for contempt shall be instituted unless begun within one year of the act complained of; but we held that the specific exception contained in section 24'nothing herein contained'applied to all provisions of the act relating to prosecutions for criminal contempts, and therefore applied to section 25, 'as well as to the other sections,' and that the one-year limitation prescribed by section 25 was without application to a case brought for the disobedience of a decree entered in a suit prosecuted by the United States.\n  That decision controls here. The object of section 24 clearly was to limit the application of the provisions of section 22, and the other sections named, to prosecutions for contempt arising out of cases instituted by private litigants.\n  Second. We find nothing in the further contention that this view of the statute results in a discrimination \n\n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOFFMAN V.

Anderson, both of Washington, D.C ., for petitioner.\n  Mr. Leland Walker, of Somerset, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The First National Bank, Boswell, Pa., was declared insolvent January 26, 1932. Shortly thereafter a receiver took charge. [ Hoffman v. Rauch   \n300 \nU.S. 255\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 255\n, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n  January 21, 1932, the bank's cashier, without her consent, sold four Liberty bonds ($100 each), belonging to Mrs. Rauch and held by it for safekeeping, to the Lohrs. The purchase price was charged to their deposit account.\n  Mrs. Rauch died June 2, 1932. Claiming a preference, respondent, her administrator, refused the receiver's offer of a general claim against the estate and brought suit. Upon a directed verdict the administrator obtained judgment as a preferred creditor. The court was of opinion 'that the assets of the bank were augmented when the bank received from its customer the price agreed upon for said bonds and, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to participate in the distribution of the assets of the defendant bank as a preferred creditor.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed with an opinion which states: 'With the District Judge, we think that the proceeds of these bonds augmented the assets of the bank. They certainly reduced its liability to others.'\n  Petitioner maintans that the bank's assets were not increased through sale of the bonds; that nothing arose therefrom which in original or changed form can be traced into the hands of the receiver.\n  Respondent submits that since the bank used the bonds in discharge of a liability it 'was thereby saved the use of its own funds for that purpose and the assets of the bank at the time of closing were therefore larger in amount than they otherwise would have been. A discharge or reduction of a liability produces a corresponding increase in assets. For every debit there must be a credit.'\n  Obviously nothing of value was added to the bank's property. Nothing new came into its treasury. A credit entry against an outstanding obligation represented the only possible benefit. Its total liabilities were not reduced since a new obligation arose to pay to the owner the value of the bonds. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 255\n, 257]\n\u00a0\n  Here it is accepted doctrine that when a claim is made for preference against funds held by the receiver of a national bank the burden is upon the claimant to establish his title; he must definitely trace something of value which belonged to him, or the avails therefrom, into the receiver's possession.

Also, a mere showing that the bank wrongly used property of another in discharging its indebtedness does not suffice to establish a preferred claim against the receiver.\n  Accordingly, we must hold that the courts below were in error and reverse the challenged judgment.\n  The applicable legal principles were much discussed in Blakey, Receiver, v. Brinson, \n286 \nU.S. 254, 82\n A.L.R. 1288; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Pottorff, Receiver, supra; Jennings, Receiver, et al. v.

In Old Company's Lehigh, Inc., v. Meeker, Receiver, et al., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 227\n, at page 229, 393, we asserted: 'What was done by the Mamaroneck bank on January 14, 1933, did not involve in its doing the creation of a special deposit or an augmentation of the assets. What was done had no effect except to diminish liabilities by reducing the indebtedness due to a depositor.' And Adams, Receiver, v.

We said (\n294 \nU.S. 231, 239\n, 402): 'Evidence is lacking that it was withdrawn in such a form or for such purposes as to be represented by any assets forming part of the estate today.'\n  Respondent was not entitled to a preference.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for United States as amicus curiae.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The controversy is one as to the number of dollars in present currency that will discharge a covenant for rent in leases antedating the reduction of the gold content of the dollar, the covenant being phrased in the manner hereinafter stated.\n  At various times between 1881 and 1897 thirteen leases were executed by the Holyoke Water Company, the petitioner, to the American Writing Paper Company, Inc., the respondent, for the enjoyment in perpetuity of water-power rights and privileges in consideration of an annual rental. With variations immaterial for present purposes, the provision for rental is the same in all the leases. By concession the following form has been accepted as typical: The grantee shall yield and pay unto the grantor as rent 'a quantity of gold which shall be equal in amount to fifteen hundred ($1500) dollars of the gold coin of the United States of the standard of weight and fineness of the year 1894, or the equivalent of this commodity in United States currency.' In 1894 and continuously thereafter till January 31, 1934, the statutory gold content of the dollar was twenty-five and eight tenths grains of gold, nine tenths fine. Since January 31, 1934, by force of the Gold Reserve Act of that year (48 Stat. 337) and the order of the President thereunder (Presidential Proclamation No. 2072 (31 \nU.S.C. A.  821 note)) the gold content of the dollar has been fixed to consist of fifteen and five twenty-firsts grains of gold, nine tenths fine. Before that reduction a Joint Resolution of the Congress, dated June 5, 1933 (48 Stat. 112 (31 \nU.S.C.A.  462, 463)), had declared that every obligation payable in money of the United States, whether theretofore or thereafter incurred, should be discharged upon payment, dollar for \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 334]\n\u00a0\n dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment was legal tender for public or private debts, irrespective of any provision contained therein whereby the obligee was given a right to require payment in gold or in a particular kind of coin or currency, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby. The precise terms of the Resolution and its recitals will be considered more at length hereafter.\n  In June, 1934, the dollar having been then devalued, the lessee corporation became insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they matured. Taking advantage of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 \nU.S.C.A.  207) it filed a petition for reorganization which the Court of Bankruptcy approved. The lessor (petitioner here) intervened in that proceeding and prayed that the amount due to it for rent under the several water-power leases be inquired into and determined. On behalf of the lessee the contention was that by force of the Joint Resolution the debt was dischargeable, dollar for dollar, in the then prevailing currency. On behalf of the lessor the contention was that the market price of fine gold at the time of the default and later was $35 an ounce, or $31.50 for an ounce nine tenths fine, and that payment should be made upon that basis for as many ounces of such gold as were contained in the stipulated dollars at the execution of the leases. In pressing that contention, the lessor did not deny that the law declines to give effect to contracts whereby debts are made payable in gold coin, or in currency varying in amount with the gold basis of the dollar. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co ., \n294 \nU.S. 240, 95\n A.L.R. 1352. What was argued was rather this, that the covenant here in question was not for the payment of a debt, but for the sale of a commodity, or if viewed as a covenant for payment, that the standard was the commodity value of the bullion, not the value of the coin as money, the difference being thought to be sufficient to change the applicable rule. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 335]\n\u00a0\n The District Court held in favor of the lessee, and computed the indebtedness accordingly. In re American Writing Paper Co., 11 F.Supp. 518; see (D.C.) 9 F.Supp. 451. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 83 F.(2d) 398. Because of the importance of the question we granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 526\n.\n  1. The obligation was one for the payment of money, and not for the delivery of gold as upon the sale of a commodity.\n  The lessor was a water power company, engaged in that business and not in any other. There is no pretense that it was stipulating for gold to be used in art or industry. What it wished was currency, or bullion susceptible of being converted into currency, the lessee to make the choice. The alternative forms of payment shed light upon each other. They will be considered in succession.\n  By the first term of the alternative, there may be payment of the rent in the form of 'a quantity of gold which shall be equal in amount to $ 1500 of the gold coin of the United States of the standard of weight and fineness of the year 1894.' In this form there is no call for a stated number of ounces of fine gold, as if a goldsmith were providing for the uses of his business. The call is for gold that shall be as heavy and as fine as a stated number of gold dollars, with the result that delivery in such dollars is a payment in strict accordance with the letter of the contract. We must consider the situation of the parties, their business needs and expectations, in gauging their intention. When these are kept in view, the gold is seen to be a standard with which to stabilize the value of the dollar; the dollar not a yardstick with which to measure the quantity of the gold. To read the leases otherwise is to permit the realities of the transaction, its substance and essential purpose, to be obscured by forms and phrases. Long ago it was said by a distinguished member of this court, commenting upon a different statute, but one analogous in purpose: 'If the contract \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 336]\n\u00a0\n is for the delivery of a chattel or a specific commodity or substance, the law does not apply. If it is bona fide for so many carats of diamonds or so many ounces of gold as bullion, the specific contract must be performed ( assuming, of course, that contracts for the delivery of bullion are not prohibited by law). But if terms which naturally import such a contract are used by way of evasion, and money only is intended, the law reaches the case.' Per Bradley, J., in Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 566. Here what was intended was to assure the payment of a money debt in dollars of a value as constant as that of gold. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at page 302, 413, 95 A.L.R. 1352; cf. Feist v. Socie te Intercommunale Belge D'Electricite (1934) A.C. 161, 172, 173. The fact is of little moment that currency is characterized as a commodity in the verbiage of the covenant as long as it is currency. Cf. Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557, 561\n, 562, 550, 551. Weasel words will not avail to defeat the triumph of intention when once the words are read in the setting of the whole transaction. So read, the end to be achieved is shown forth unmistakably as a payment, not a sale.\n  This conclusion would be necessary though the first of the alternative forms of payment stood alone in the indentures. The necessity becomes even plainer when the first is considered in conjunction with the second. The lessee at its option may pay the equivalent of the gold 'in United States currency.' The presence of this alternative gives a quietus to the argument that the lessor was desirous of the gold as a commodity and was bargaining therefor. If there had been any such desire, the choice as to the forms of payment would never have been left to the lessee, as by implication of law it was, for a debtor, if methods of performance are alternative, may choose whichever one he pleases. 3 Williston, Contracts,  1407; Restatement of the Law of Contracts, vol. 1, p. 493. In point of fact, there were statutes in existence \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 337]\n\u00a0\n at the time of the default in payment that made delivery of gold impossible. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at pages 295, 296, 410, 411, 95 A.L.R. 1352; Nortz v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 317, 327\n, 328, 430, 431. 79 L.Ed. 907, 95 A.L.R. 1346; Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 55 S. Ct. 432, 437, 95 A.L.R. 1335. The lessee would perforce have had to avail itself of the second term of the alternative, if it had been able to pay at all. But if both modes of payment had been preserved, the second equally with the first would have been effective to discharge the obligation. Payment in currency, quite as much as payment in coin or in bullion, was not only performance under the law, but performance under the contract, provided only that the value of the currency was equal, when paid, to the value of the gold. Whether that proviso has been abrogated is next to be considered.\n  2. A contract for the payment of gold as the equivalent of money, and a fortiori a contract for the payment of money measurable in gold, is within the letter of the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, and equally within its spirit.\n  The Resolution, for convenience of reference, is printed in the margin. \n1\n Its history has been traced in Norman \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 338]\n\u00a0\n v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra. There is no need to repeat what has been already done so thoroughly. The Resolution touches gold as well as coin or currency whenever transactions in either are within the evil to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 339]\n\u00a0\n be remedied. We learn from the preamble that 'provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby, obstruct the power of the Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States, and are inconsistent with the declared policy of the Congress to maintain at all times the equal power of every dollar, coined or issued by the United States, in the markets and in the payment of debts.' Accordingly, all such provisions are declared to be against public policy, and every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, though it contain such provisions, shall be payable, dollar for dollar, in legal tender at the time of payment. Transactions for the sale of delivery of gold for industrial purposes are not within the evil to be remedied, and so are not within the statute. Cf. Executive Order of April 5, 1933, No. 6102, and August 28, 1933, No. 6260 ( 12 \nU.S.C.A.  95 note); Orders of the Secretary of the Treasury, December 28, 1933 and January 15, 1934; Emergency Banking Relief Act of March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, 2,  3 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  248(n). An obligation to make delivery upon a bona fide sale is not fairly to be classified as an obligation 'payable in money' (Joint Resolution,  1, subdivision (b), 31 \nU.S.C.A.  463(b), or so we now assume. But very definitely, the evil does include transactions whereby gold, coined or uncoined, is to be delivered in satisfaction of a debt expressed in terms of dollars, payment, not sale, being then the end to be achieved. As definitely, indeed more obviously, the evil includes transactions whereby a debt is to be discharged, not in bullion, but in dollars, if the number of the dollars is to be increased or diminished in proportion to the diminution or the increase of the gold basis of the currency. Both forms of obligation are illustrations of the very mischief that Congress sought to hit.\n'Approved, June 5, 1933, 4.40 p.m.'\n\n  3. The argument is made that in the case now before us the currency called for by the contract is stated too \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 340]\n\u00a0\n indefinitely to be translated, dollar for dollar, as required by the Resolution, into the legal tender of the hour. But the difficulty is quite imaginary. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. There is application for the maxim here. If the currency to be paid by the lessee is to be the equivalent of gold, and if the gold is to be the equivalent of a stated number of gold dollars of a particular weight and fineness, then the covenant to pay the currency is tantamount to a covenant to pay the dollars, and dollars of the stated standard. This is the obligation that respondent took upon itself when it became a party to these leases. It is, however, the very obligation that has been outlawed by the statute as a menace to the maintenance of our monetary system. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at pages 306, 311, 415, 417, 95 A.L.R. 1352. 'Dollar for dollar' the obligation for the payment of money conforming to the standard of the covenant is to be discharged with money of the standard established by the law.\n  4. The argument is made that covenants of this particular form are so rare and exceptional that the protection of the monetary system does not require their suppression, and that arbitrary suppression is inconsistent with the Fifth Amendment. How exceptional or rare they are, we have no means of ascertaining. For anything proved in the record or subject to judicial notice they may be illustrations, even if verbal variants, of a type common in the petitioner's business and indeed in many others. But the power of the Congress is not dependent upon the results of such a census. A particular covenant, if viewed in isolation, may have a slight, perhaps a trivial, influence upon the effectiveness and symmetry of a new monetary policy. The aggregate of many covenants, each contributing its mite, may bring the system to destruction. Rivulets in combination make up a stream of tendency that may attain engulfing power. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 324\n, 341]\n\u00a0\n No principle of constitutional law, no dictate of fair dealing, lays a duty upon the Congress to single out for special treatment an individual or a few among the members of a common mass. Cf. Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 201\n. One cannot even say with reason that the effects of this particular covenant are to be classified as negligible. The lessee as the recipient of principal or income must accept payment from its debtors in the depreciated currency. It is injured, at least appreciably, if it is required to pay its creditors in dollars of a different standard. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at page 315, 419, 95 A.L.R. 1352. Receipts and disbursements are no longer on a common basis.\n  5. In last analysis, the case for the petitioner amounts to little more than this, that the effect of the Resolution in its application to these leases is to make the value of the dollars fluctuate with variations in the weight and fineness of the monetary standard, and thus defeat the expectation of the parties that the standard would be constant and the value relatively stable. Such, indeed, is the effect, and the covenant of the parties is to that extent abortive. But the disappointment of expectations and even the frustration of contracts may be a lawful exercise of power when expectation and contract are in conflict with the public welfare. 'Contracts may create rights of property, but, when contracts deal with a subject-matter which lies within the control of the Congress, they have a congenital infirmity.' Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at pages 307, 308, 416, 95 A.L.R. 1352. To that congential infirmity this covenant succumbs.\n  The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.\n  Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Joint Resolution\n'To assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States.\n\n'Whereas the holding of or dealing in gold affect the public interest, and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction; and\n\n'Whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby, obstruct the power of the Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States, and are inconsistent with the declared policy of the Congress to maintain at all times the equal power of every dollar, coined or issued by the United States, in the markets and in the payment of debts.

McGohey, of New York City, for the State of New York, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Upon the filing of the jurisdictional statement, the appellee moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the decision of the federal question now raised was not necessary to the determination of the cause. Rule 12, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 16]\n\u00a0\n par. 3, 28 \nU.S.C.A. following section 354. Further consideration of the motion was postponed to the hearing upon the merits.\n  The record is brief. The suit was brought against the executor of the estate of Herbert W. Hanan, deceased, to recover a deficiency judgment upon a bond secured by a mortgage which had been foreclosed in an earlier suit in which the mortgaged property had been sold and an application for a deficiency judgment had been refused. The judgment in the present suit dismissed the amended complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n  The amended complaint alleged that in 1907 the John H. Hanan Realty Company, with John H. Hanan, had executed a bond for $118,000, and as collateral security the John H. Hanan Realty Company had made a mortgage covering certain premises in the city of New York; that later the bond and mortgage were assigned to John H. Hanan; that in 1920 John H. Hanan, together with Herbert W. Hanan (defendant's testator) and Addison G. Hanan, had executed their joint and several bond to the guardians of the estates of certain infants in the sum of $60,000 and as collateral security therefor John H. Hanan had assigned to the obligees the bond and mortgage first mentioned; and that thereafter the bond of John H. Hanan, Herbert W. Hanan, and Addison G. Hanan had been assigned, together with the bond and mortgage first mentioned, to the plaintiff.\n  A copy of the bond in suit was annexed. It recited that it was executed as additional security for the payment of the first mentioned bond and mortgage, upon which the principal sum of $60,000 remained unpaid, and that the time for payment had been extended as provided in a contemporaneous agreement. The condition of the obligation was the payment of that sum with interest as the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 17]\n\u00a0\n same should become due and payable according to the terms and conditions of the bond and mortgage first mentioned and the extension agreement.\n  The amended complaint further alleged that the John H. Hanan Realty Company had failed to comply with the terms of the bond and mortgage first mentioned and had failed to pay the taxes on the mortgaged premises or the interest on the bond; that thereupon, in September, 1933, the plaintiff had brought an action to foreclose the mortgage and that the defendant herein was a party to that action; that pursuant to judgment therein the mortgaged premises were sold and the proceeds were applied on account of the indebtedness due the plaintiff; that the referee's report of sale was confirmed; that thereafter a motion was 'duly made for a deficiency judgment' which was denied and the foreclosure action was discontinued as to the defendant herein by the filing of a stipulation; that the deficiency due the plaintiff was $58,523.35 upon which $554.01 had been received by the plaintiff from the receiver in the foreclosure action, leaving due $57,969.34 which the decedent, Herbert W. Hanan, became bound to pay.\n  The amended complaint and the motion to dismiss for the insufficiency of its allegations contained no mention of a federal question. The trial court granted the motion with the mere statement that, 'The mortgage moratorium laws apply to the facts alleged in the said complaint.' The judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the Appellate Division without opinion. 246 App.Div. 781, 285 N.Y.S. 527. The Court of Appeals granted leave to appeal and in May, 1936, affirmed the judgment, also without opinion. 271 N.Y. 564, 3 N.E.(2d) 186. In the entire progress of the cause to this point of determination by the highest court of the State, the record discloses no reference to a federal question. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 18]\n\u00a0\n  In June, 1936, upon motion, the Court of Appeals amended its remittitur by adding the following: 'A question under the Federal Constitution was presented and necessarily passed upon by this court. The plaintiff contended that chapter 794 of the Laws of the State of New York, enacted in 1933, Ex.Sess., as amended (sections 1083-a and 1083-b of Civil Practice Act), impair the obligations of contracts, and thus violate article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States. This court held that such laws do not violate said provision of article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States.' 271 N.Y. 662, 3 N.E.( 2d) 473, 474.\n  It is solely upon this statement in the amended remittitur that we are asked to review the judgment and to pass upon the constitutionality of the state statute. We are not aided by any discussion by the state court of the question thus described, or by its explication or construction of the statute cited, or by a statement of the particular application of the statute to which the paragraph in the amended remittitur is addressed.\n  Before we may undertake to review a decision of the court of a State it must appear affirmatively from the record, not only that the federal question was presented for decision to the highest court of the State having jurisdiction but that its decision of the federal question was necessary to the determination of the cause. Lynch v. New York, \n293 \nU.S. 52, 54\n, 17, and cases there cited. Whether these requirements have been met is itself a federal question. As this Court must decide whether it has jurisdiction in a particular case, this Court must determine whether the federal question was necessarily passed upon by the state court. That determination must rest upon an examination of the record. A certificate or statement by the state court1 that a fed- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 19]\n\u00a0\n eral question has been presented to it and necessarily passed upon is not controlling. While such a certificate or statement may aid this Court in the examination of the record, it cannot avail to foreclose the inquiry which it is our duty to make or to import into the record a federal question which otherwise the record wholly fails to present.\n  In Commercial Bank of Cincinnati v. Buckingham's Executors, 5 How. 317, this Court was asked to decide a question which was said to be presented under the contract clause with respect to the validity of a statute of Ohio. The Supreme Court of that State entered upon its record an elaborate certificate stating that the validity of the statute was drawn in question upon the ground that as applied to the charter of the plaintiffs in error it 'impaired the obligations thereof, and was repugnant to the constitution of the United States, and that the decision of this court (the Ohio court) was in favor of the validity of the said act of the legislature as so applied.' Notwithstanding the certificate, the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Id., 5 How. 317 at page 343. The Court said: 'It is not enough, that the record shows that 'the plaintiff in error contended and claimed' that the judgment of the court impaired the obligation of a contract, and violated the provisions of the constitution of the United States, and 'that this claim was overruled by the court'; but it must appear, by clear and necessary intendment, that the question must have been raised, and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 20]\n\u00a0\n must have been decided, in order to induce the judgment. Let us inquire, then, whether it appears on the face of this record, that the validity of a statute of Ohio, 'on the ground of its repugnancy to the constitution or laws of the United States,' was drawn in question in this case.' Id., 5 How. 317, at page 341.\n  Pursuing that essential inquiry, the Court found that the question decided by the state court was one of the construction of the statute and not of its validity.\n  In Lawler v. Walker, 14 How. 149, the Supreme Court of Ohio certified that the validity of statutes of the State had been drawn in question as being in violation of the Federal Constitution and that the court had held the statutes to be valid. The certificate in that case was found to be vague and indefinite but the Court also re-stated the above- quoted ruling of Commercial Bank of Cincinnati v. Buckingham's Executors, supra. While in Parmelee v. Lawrence, 11 Wall. 36, 39, the certificate was made by the presiding judge of the state court and not by the court itself, we took occasion to say: 'We will add, if this court should entertain jurisdiction upon a certificate alone in the absence of any evidence of the question in the record, then the Supreme Court of the State can give the jurisdiction in every case where the question is made by counsel in the argument. The office of the certificate, as it respects the Federal question, is to make more certain and specific what is too general and indefinite in the record, but is incompetent to originate the question within the true construction of the 25th section (of the Judiciary Act).' Id., 11 Wall. 36, at page 39.\n  This statement was quoted with approval in Powell v. Brunswick County, \n150 \nU.S. 433, 439\n.\n  The case of Brown v. Atwell, \n92 \nU.S. 327\n, affords another illustration of the rule. The judgment was rendered in the Court of Appeals of New York and an entry was made in its record that on the argument of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 21]\n\u00a0\n appeal it was claimed by the appellant that the Act of Congress of 1836 (5 Stat. 117), known as the Patent Act, governed the effect of the several transfers relating to the letters patent appearing in the case, and that the court had decided against the claims urged under that act. This Court observed that, until the certificate of the Court of Appeals, it nowhere appeared in the record that any question was raised as to the effect of the patent laws upon the title under consideration. And the Court said (Id ., \n92 \nU.S. 327\n, at pages 329, 330):\n'We have often decided that it is not enough to give us jurisdiction over the judgments of the State courts for the record to show that a Federal question was argued or presented to that court for decision. It must appear that its decision was necessary to the determination of the cause, and that it was actually decided, or that the judgment as rendered could not have been given without deciding it.

City Deposit Bank Co., \n200 \nU.S. 405, 412\n, 290, as follows: 'It is elementary that the certificate of a court of last resort of a state may not import a Federal question into a record where otherwise such question does not arise; it is equally elementary that such a certificate may serve to elucidate the determination whether a Federal question exists.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 22]\n\u00a0\n  Thus the true function of a certificate or statement of a state court, by way of amendment of, or addition to, the record, is to aid in the understanding of the record, to clarify it by defining the federal question with reasonable precision and by showing how the question was raised and decided, so that this Court upon the record as thus clarified may be able to see that the federal question was properly raised and was necessarily determined. Our decisions in cases where certificates have been found useful should be read in the light of that fundamental consideration. In Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 223\n; as explained in Consolidated Turnpike Company v. Norfolk, etc., R. Co ., \n228 \nU.S. 596, 599\n, 606, there was 'a record disclosure of the existence of the Federal question,' which was also certified. In the latter case it was assumed that the certificate, made by order of the state court, operated to show that some federal question was decided, but on examining the record this Court found the question to be unsubstantial and denied rehearing, the case having previously been dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Id., \n228 \nU.S. 596\n, at page 603, 33 S. Ct. 605. The record in Cincinnati Packet Company v. Bay, \n200 \nU.S. 179, 182\n, showed that the federal question had been raised and the certificate aided in disclosing that the question was not treated as having been raised too late under the local procedure, a point upon which the state court was the judge. Applying the rule, in Rector v. City Deposit Bank Co., supra, the Court concluded that as the suit was brought by a trustee in bankruptcy by virtue of the authority conferred upon him by the act of Congress the certificate made 'clear the fact, if it were otherwise doubtful, that rights under the bankrupt law were relied upon and passed upon below.' See, also, Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238, 243\n, 244. It was in the light of these decisions that the question was presented in Whitney v. People of California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 360\n-362, 642, 643. The writ of error had been dismissed \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 23]\n\u00a0\n for want of jurisdiction (\n269 \nU.S. 530\n) and a motion for rehearing was granted. \n269 \nU.S. 538\n. The Court of Appeal of the State, as an addition to the record, entered an order stating that the question whether the California Criminal Syndicalism Act (St.Cal. 1919, p. 281) and its application were repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution was considered and passed upon by the court. While this Court said that the record did not show that the defendant had raised or the state court had decided a federal question except as it appeared from that order, the record did disclose facts indicating the presence of the federal question which the order of the state court said was actually presented and decided, and accordingly jurisdiction was entertained. And it has been in recognition of the established principle governing the exercise of our jurisdiction, and not as a departure from it, that we have said that opportunity might be afforded upon seasonable application to obtain a certificate from the state court where it appeared that an appropriate certificate might lead to a better understanding of the record. See Lynch v. New York, supra; International Steel Co. v. Surety Co., \n297 \nU.S. 657, 662\n, 622.\n  In some of the cases cited above, we found from our examination of the record that, notwithstanding the certificate, the decision of the state court rested upon an adequate non-federal ground and hence we were without jurisdiction. See Commercial Bank of Cincinnati v. Buckingham's Executors, supra; Brown v. Atwell, supra; Powell v. Brunswick County, supra. A similar result follows where, even assuming that the state court has formally determined a federal question, it does not appear to have been a substantial one. See Consolidated Turnpike Company v. Norfolk, etc., R. Co., supra. In other cases an examination of the record has left the Court in doubt as to what has actually been determined. That is the situation in the present case. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 24]\n\u00a0\n  The appellee points to the provision of section 1078 of the Civil Practice Act of New York (enacted long before the so-called moratorium acts) that, after final judgment for the plaintiff in a foreclosure action, no other action shall be maintained to recover any part of the mortgage debt without leave of the court in which the former action was brought. In the instant case the amended complaint does not allege that such leave was obtained. We are also advised of decisions by the state court, prior to the one here sought to be reviewed, construing chapter 794 of the Laws of New York of 1933, Ex.Sess., as amended (sections 1083-a and 1083-b of the Civil Practice Act) to which the amended remittitur refers. That Act ( section 1083-a) forbids a judgment for any residue of the debt, remaining unsatisfied after sale of the mortgaged property, except as therein provided. Provision is made for an application by the creditor in the foreclosure action for leave to enter a deficiency judgment, and thereupon the court is to determine the fair and reasonable market value of the mortgaged premises and is to make an order directing the entry of a deficiency judgment, which is to be for an amount equal to that remaining due less the market value as determined or the sale price of the property whichever shall be the higher; and if no motion for a deficiency judgment is thus made, the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are to be regarded as full satisfaction of the mortgage debt 'and no right to recover any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist.' Section 1083-b provides that in actions, other than foreclosure actions, to recover for an indebtedness secured solely by a mortgage on real property and originating simultaneously with such mortgage and secured thereby, against any one 'directly or indirectly or contingently liable therefor,' the party against whom the money judgment is demanded shall be entitled to set off the reasonable market value of the mortgaged property less prior liens. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 25]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals had sustained the constitutional validity of this legislation which would seem to be applicable to an action upon a collateral bond such as that described in the amended complaint herein. See Klinke v. Samuels, 264 N.Y. 144, 190 N.E. 324; City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Ardlea Incorporation, 267 N.Y. 224, 196 N.E. 34.\n  With these recent decisions in mind, it may be, as has been suggested, that the Court of Appeals considered the federal question, which it described in the amended remittitur as relating to the validity of sections 1083-a and 1083-b, to be no more than a challenge of the requirement that the right to a deficiency judgment should be heard and determined in the forclosure action, and sustained the validity of that requirement, without reviewing, or deeming it necessary to review, the questions which could have been raised, and if properly raised could have been brought to this Court in the foreclosure action to which both the plaintiff and defendant herein had been parties. Whether this view of the action of the state court is the correct one, we are unable satisfactorily to determine. If its decision was in truth based upon the theory that by a proper construction of the statute or for any other reason the extent of the deficiency or the right to recover it had been finally determined in a prior litigation, there was no longer a necessity to inquire whether the statute would be constitutional in its application to a different case-a case lacking the feature of any prior determination-and an answer to that inquiry would be superfluous, even if attempted.\n  In the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct errors in the judgment under review but to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. We have applied this principle to cases coming from state courts where supervening changes had occurred since the entry of the judgment, and where the record failed adequately to state the facts underlying \n\n[300 \nU.S. 14\n, 26]\n\u00a0\n the decision of the federal question. See Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600, 607\n, 578; Villa v. Van Schaick, \n299 \nU.S. 152\n; decided December 7, 1936. We have afforded an opportunity for appropriate presentation of the question by an amendment of the record as the state court might be advised. Villa v. Van Schaick, supra. We think that a similar opportunity should be accorded here in order that uncertainty may be removed and that the precise nature of the federal question, how it was raised and the grounds of its disposition, may be definitely set forth, so that we may be able to decide whether a substantial question within our jurisdiction has necessarily been determined.\n  For that purpose the judgment is vacated and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.\n  It is so ordered. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the insufficiency of a certificate by the chief justice or presiding justice of the state court, see Mississippi & M.

Tuozzo, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Robert B. Honeyman, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Upon the prior appeal, the cause was remanded for further proceedings to the end that uncertainty might be removed and that the precise nature of the federal question, how it was raised, and the grounds of its disposition, might be definitely set forth. \n300 \nU.S. 14, 26\n, 57 S.Ct. 350. The Court of Appeals of the state has heard reargument and has defined the federal question which it has decided. 275 N.Y. 382, 9 N.E. 2d 970, 974. The court affirmed a judgment which dismissed the amended complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The case comes here on appeal which appellee moves to dismiss for the want of jurisdiction.\n The bond in suit is a collateral bond 'which binds the obligor indirectly to pay the existing mortgage indebtedness.' The amended complaint set forth the obligation of the bond and the breach of condition. It alleged that an action, to which defendant was a party, had been brought to foreclose the mortgage; that pursuant to judgment therein the mortgaged premises were sold and the proceeds were applied on account of the indebtedness; and that in the foreclosure action a motion was duly made for a deficiency judgment which was denied. Section 1083-a of the New York Civil Practice Act forbids a judgment for any residue of the debt remaining unsatisfied after sale of the mortgaged property except as therein provided. Section 1083-b governs actions, other than foreclosure actions, to recover judgment for any indebtedness secured solely by a mortgage upon real property, 'against any person or corporation directly or indirectly or contingently liable therefor.' The state court has held that section 1083-a is intended to provide 'an exclusive procedure for the entry of a judgment for any residue of a debt secured by a mortgage after sale of the mortgaged \n\n[302 \nU.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n premises.' The state court has also ruled that the defendant was a party to the foreclosure action and upon proper proof the final judgment therein 'might have awarded payment by him of the residue of the debt remaining unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged property, and 'application of the proceeds, pursuant to the directions contained therein.\" The foreclosure action was discontinued as to him only after a motion for a deficiency judgment was denied.\n Appellant challenges the validity of sections 1083-a and 1083-b. As to the federal question involved in the present suit, the state court has said: 'We are not advised whether in the foreclosure action the plaintiff challenged the validity of section 1083-a. Even if the plaintiff did properly challenge in that action the validity of section 1083-a, we could not upon this appeal consider that challenge, for no order or judgment in that action is before us for review. On this appeal we review only the decision that after denial of a deficiency judgment in the foreclosure action upon a motion made pursuant to section 1083-a, the plaintiff is not entitled to maintain an action to recover upon the bond which the defendant's testator, Herbert W. Hanan, signed as obligor. The challenge to the constitutional validity of the statute raises the constitutional question whether the obligations of the contract are impaired and article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States violated by the provisions of sections 1083-a and 1083-b, which provide that during the emergency period an action to recover a money judgment for any indebtedness secured by mortgage may not be maintained after the mortgaged premises have been sold under a judgment of foreclosure and sale, unless the right to a deficiency judgment has been determined in the foreclosure action. We decided that question against the appellant after the original argument. We adhere to that decision now.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n In view of this ruling as to the exclusive procedure for which section 1083-a provides, it appears that the federal question now raised is simply whether the state legislation which requires that the right to a deficiency judgment must be determined in the foreclosure action violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. Article 1, section 10. That question relates to the distribution of jurisdiction in the state courts. The Federal Constitution does not undertake to control the power of a state to determine by what process legal rights may be asserted or legal obligations be enforced, provided the method of procedure gives reasonable notice and affords fair opportunity to be heard before the issues are decided. The question of the validity of the state legislation could have been raised in the foreclosure action and brought to this court in accordance with the applicable rules.\n The requirement that the right to a deficiency judgment should be determined in the foreclosure action as against one who was a party to that action raises no substantial federal question.

The suits were brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. That court, on motion of petitioner, deeming the presence of the United States to be indispensable, dismissed the bills as amended. Thereupon, by permission of the court, second-amended bills were filed. Petitioner renewed his motions to dismiss, which the court then denied. A special appeal was allowed by the court below, and resulted in an affirmance of the decree of the trial court. 66 App.D.C. 128, 85 F.(2d) 294. The allegations of the three second-amended bills of complaint differ in some particulars; but whether these differences will affect the extent or measure of the rights of the respective respondents or the final disposition of the suits so as to require unlike decrees, we do not determine. They are not such as to necessitate diverse rulings in respect of the question which now is presented for decision. In this view, we confine our statement, except as otherwise noted, to the allegations of the bill of complaint in the Fox Case, No. 266.\n  Petitioner, as Secretary of the Interior, has charge of the administration of the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388), as amended. In 1906, the then Secretary of the Interior approved a reclamation project known as the 'Sunnyside Unit of the Yakima Project'; and purchased from the Washington Irrigation Company the Sunnyside Canal, together with the water appropriations and irrigation system connected therewith. At the time of the purchase, certain arid and unirrigated lands described in the bill, thereafter and now owned by respondents, were within the unit embraced by the project.\n  The then owners of the lands, predecessors of respondents in title, and other owners of similar lands, incorporated the Sunnyside Water Users Association under the lands within the reclamation project, and lands within \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 89]\n\u00a0\n the reclamation project, and agreed to take water from the project to irrigate such lands.\n  The association, on May 7, 1906, entered into a contract with the United States, the recitals of which in substance, so far as pertinent, are that these lands are desert and arid in character and will remain so unless the waters of the Yakima river and its tributaries be impounded and the flow regulated and controlled; that the Secretary contemplates the construction of irrigation works under the Reclamation Act for the irrigation and reclamation of these lands; that the incorporators and shareholders of the association are required to be owners and occupants of lands within the area to be irrigated, and already are in some cases appropriators of water for the irrigation thereof; that they are required to initiate rights to the use of water from the proposed irrigation works as soon as may be, and complete the acquisition thereof as prescribed by the Secretary, 'which rights shall be, and thereafter continue to be, forever appurtenant to designated lands owned by such shareholders.'\n  Following these recitals, it was agreed that only those who became members of the association should be accepted as applicants for rights to the use of water; that the aggregate amount of such rights should not exceed the number of acres of land capable of irrigation by the total quantity of water available-namely, the quantity now appropriated by shareholders of the association and the quantity to be delivered from all sources in excess of the water now appropriated; that the Secretary should determine the number of acres capable of such irrigation, 'to be based upon and measured and limited by the beneficial use of water'; that water rights should be paid for in ten annual installments; that the association guarantees payment for that part of the cost of the irrigation works apportioned to its shareholders-times \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 90]\n\u00a0\n and methods of payment being stipulated in detail; that rights to water where the same have vested were to be defined, determined, and enjoyed in accordance with the Reclamation Act and other acts of Congress on the subject of the acquisition and enjoyment of such rights, and by the laws of the state of Washington.\n  Some time after the execution of the foregoing contract, the predecessors in title of respondents, upon officially-approved forms, made applications for water rights for the irrigation of the lands here involved. By the terms of the applications, the measure of the water right for the land was stated to be that quantity which shall be beneficially used for the irrigation thereof, not exceeding the share proportionate to irrigable acreage of the water supply actually available, to be paid for ( in ten annual installments) in an amount which was fixed in each application. \n1\n The applicants agreed that the construction charge and the annual charges for operation and maintenance should be and were made a lien upon the lands and all water rights then or thereafter appurtenant or belonging thereto, together with all improvements thereon.\n  It further is alleged that a former Secretary of the Interior determined that the total cost of the water rights for all the lands in the unit would be $52 per acre, and that such sum would be sufficient to return to the reclamation fund the total cost of the project; that, pursuant to the terms of the Reclamation Act, he fixed the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 91]\n\u00a0\n construction charge for the land here involved at that amount per acre, and issued public notice and order accordingly; that thereafter the successive Secretaries of the Interior uniformly construed the Reclamation Act and the contractual obligations, to the effect that the owners of the lands had purchased a sufficient quantity of water to beneficially and successfully irrigate their lands, to be determined by representatives of the Secretary having physical charge of the water distribution, from a factual investigation and personal examination of the lands and the crops growing thereon and the water requirements thereof.\n  Pursuant thereto, it was determined by representatives of the successive Secretaries that 4.84 acre feet of water per annum per acre was necessary to beneficially and successfully irrigate respondents' lands; that, thereupon, the Secretaries of the Interior, through their representatives, have, for a period of more than twenty years, delivered to such lands the necessary quantity of water; that after the construction of the irrigation system and reservoirs of sufficient capacity to beneficially and successfully irrigate all lands within the unit, an act of Congress was passed providing that no increase of construction charges could be made after they had been fixed by public notice and order, except by agreement between the secretary and a majority of the water-right applicants (Act Aug. 13, 1914,  4, 43 \nU.S.C.A.  469). On September 24, 1914, the then Secretary of the Interior issued a public notice and order, declaring that there would be no increase in the construction charges against the lands.\n  Respondents and their predecessors, it is alleged, have fully complied with the terms of the Reclamation Act and all obligations in connection with their water rights, and have paid to the government all sums due on account of construction charges, and all operation and maintenance charges, and have acquired vested water \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 92]\n\u00a0\n rights sufficient to beneficially and successfully irrigate their lands- namely, 4.84 acre feet of water per acre per annum; and that such water rights are appurtenant to their lands.\n  The bill further alleges that in 1930 the Commissioner of Reclamation desired to construct the Cle Elum Reservoir to store water for the irrigation of lands in the Kittitas Reclamation District and other lands, the canal and distributing system in that district being then in process of construction. But finding that the cost of the reservoir would exceed, by $1,000,000, the amount which would be returned to the reclamation fund, and without consulting respondents or other water users in the Sunnyside Unit of the Yakima Project, the Commissioner charged the sum of $1,000,000 to that unit and district, and informed the Secretary to that effect. Neither respondent nor any other water users in that unit or district ever agreed to this arrangement; but the then Secretary certified to the President that provision had been made for the repayment to the reclamation fund of the total cost of the reservoir, and that $1,000,000 thereof was to be obtained by rentals from the Sunny-side Division of the Yakima Project.\n  The bill further alleges that the Secretary and other officials agreed with designated persons to attempt to force and coerce respondents, and other water users in the district, to induce the district to agree to pay the additional sum; otherwise, to force and coerce them to sign water- rental applications or be deprived of a portion of the water owned by them. In pursuance thereof, public notice was given and an order issued limiting their rights to 3 acre feet per acre, and exacting a specified rental charge for additional water. Respondents and the other water users were notified that they would be deprived of all water in excess of the 3 acre feet per acre unless they made application for ad- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 93]\n\u00a0\n ditional water in a form and manner prescribed. Respondents and the other water-right users, however, refused to make such applications.\n  It is further alleged that 3 acre feet of water per acre is not, never has been, and will not in the future be sufficient to beneficially irrigate respondents' lands; but would leave a large part thereof barren and nonproductive, thereby forcing about half of their lands to bear construction, maintenance charges, taxes, and assessments upon the whole thereof. The bill shows that irreparable loss and damage will result if the order of the Secretary is enforced; and that respondents have no adequate or complete remedy at law, but that effective relief can be administered only by a court of equity. The prayer is for a decree requiring the Secretary to vacate, set aside and hold for naught the notices and orders set forth in and attached to the bill, and that respondents be restored to their former rights and privileges.\n  The bill goes into greater detail in respect of the facts; but the foregoing general statement of the allegations is enough for present purposes. Succinctly stated, the case comes to this: The United States, under the Reclamation Act, constructed an irrigation system for the purpose of storing and distributing water for irrigation of arid lands. Respondents own water rights under the system for lands of that kind; and these lands require artificial irrigation to render them productive. So far as these respondents are concerned, the government did not become the owner of the water rights, because those rights by act of Congress were made 'appurtenant to the land irrigated';2 and by a Washington statute, in force at least since 1917, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 94]\n\u00a0\n were 'to be and remain appurtenant to the land.'3 Moreover, by the contract with the government, it was the land owners who were 'to initiate rights to the use of water,' which rights were to be and 'continue to be forever appurtenant to designated lands owned by such shareholders.'\n  Respondents had made all stipulated payments and complied with all obligations by which they were bound to the government, and, long prior to the issue of the notices and orders here assailed, had acquired a vested right to the perpetual use of the waters as appurtenant to their lands. Under the Reclamation Act, supra, as well as under the law of Washington, 'beneficial use' was 'the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.' And by the express terms of the contract made between the government and the Water Users Association in behalf of respondents and other shareholders, the determination of the Secretary as to the number of acres capable of irrigation was 'to be based upon and measured and limited by the beneficial use of water.' Predecessors of petitioner, accordingly, had decided that 4.84 acre feet of water per annum per acre was necessary to the beneficial and successful irrigation of respondents' lands; and upon that decision, for a period of more than twenty years prior to the wrongs complained of, there was delivered to and used upon the lands that quantity of water. \n4\n Although the government diverted, stored, and distributed the water, the contention of petitioner that thereby ownership of the water or water rights became vested in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 95]\n\u00a0\n the United States is not well founded. Appropriation was made not for the use of the government, but, under the Reclamation Act, for the use of the landowners; and by the terms of the law and of the contract already referred to, the water rights became the property of the landowners, wholly distinct from the property right of the government in the irrigation works. Compare Murphy v. Kerr (D.C.) 296 F. 536, 544, 545. The government was and remained simply a carrier and distributor of the water ( Id.), with the right to receive the sums stipulated in the contracts as reimbursement for the cost of construction and annual charges for operation and maintenance of the works. As security therefore, it was provided that the government should have a lien upon the lands and the water rights appurtenant thereto-a provision which in itself imports that the water rights belong to another than the lienor, that is to say, to the landowner.\n  The federal government, as owner of the public domain, had the power to dispose of the land and water composing it together or separately; and by the Desert Land Act of 1877 (c. 107, 19 Stat. 377), if not before, Congress had severed the land and waters constituting the public domain and established the rule that for the future the lands should be patented separately. Acquisition of the government title to a parcel of land was not to carry with it a water right; but all nonnavigable waters were reserved for the use of the public under the laws of the various arid-land states.

And in those states, generally, including the state of Washington, it long has been established law that the right to the use of water can be acquired only by prior appropriation for a beneficial use; and that such right when thus obtained is a property right, which, when acquired for irrigation, becomes, by state law and here by express provi- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 96]\n\u00a0\n sion of the Reclamation Act as well, part and parcel of the land upon which it is applied.\n  We are thus brought to the decisive question-Is the United States an indispensable party defendant? If so, the suits, however meritorious, must fail, since no rule is better settled than that the United States cannot be sued except when Congress has so provided; and here that has not been done. Petitioner's contention that the United States is an indispensable party defendant and, as it cannot be sued, the suits should have been dismissed, is based upon the propositions, as we understand them, that the United States is the owner of the water rights; that respondents' claims rest entirely upon executory contracts; and that the relief sought is the substantial equivalent of specific performance of these contracts.\n  The fallacy of the contention is apparent, because the thus-far undenied allegations of the bill, as already appears, demonstrate that respondents have fully discharged all their contractual obligations; that their water rights have become vested; and that ownership is in them and not in the United States. The motion to dismiss concedes the truth of these allegations; but even if they were denied, we should still be obliged to indulge the presumption, in favor of the jurisdiction of the trial court, that respondents might be able to prove them. United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 218\n, 219; cf. Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 \nU.S. 204, 213\n et seq.. In support of his contention, petitioner relies upon American Falls Res. Dist. No. 2 v. Crandall (C.C.A.) 82 F.(2d) 973; but that decision, in so far as it is not in harmony with the view which we have just taken, must be disapproved.\n  The suits do not seek specific performance of any contract. They are brought to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing an order, the wrongful effect of which will be to deprive respondents of vested property rights not only acquired under Congressional acts, state \n\n[300 \nU.S. 82\n, 97]\n\u00a0\n laws and government contracts, but settled and determined by his predecessors in office. That such suits may be maintained without the presence of the United States has been established by many decisions of this court, of which the following are examples: Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172, 176; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 619\n, 344; Goltra v. Weeks, \n271 \nU.S. 536, 544\n, 615, 616; Work v. Louisiana, \n269 \nU.S. 250, 254\n, 94; Payne v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 238\n. These decisions cite other cases to the same effect. The recognized rule is made clear by what is said in the Stimson Case:\n'If the conduct of the defendant constitutes an unwarrantable interference with property of the complainant, its resort to equity for protection is not to be defeated upon the ground that the suit is one against the United States. The exemption of the United States from suit does not protect its officers from personal liability to persons whose rights of property they have wrongfully invaded. * * * And in case of an injury threatened by his illegal action, the officer cannot claim immunity from injunction process. * * *\n\n'The complainant did not ask the court to interfere with the official discretion of the Secretary of War, but challenged his authority to do the things of which complaint was made. The suit rests upon the charge of abuse of power, and its merits must be determined accordingly; it is not a suit against the United States.'\n\n  The decree of the court below is affirmed.\n  Affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 640\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Parks Case the quantity of water applied for was stated to be three acre-feet of water per annum per acre, or as much more as will be required to successfully irrigate the land.

Mathews, of Sioux City, Iowa, U.S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., and James S. Howie, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 292]\n\u00a0\n  Messrs. Ralph K. Pierson, of Compton, Cal., and Byron J. Walters, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This suit was brought by appellee in the District Court for Southern California, three judges sitting, to restrain appellants, state officers, from enforcing the provisions of the Caravan Act, Cal.Stat. 1935, c. 402, ( page 1453), as a forbidden burden on interstate commerce, and as an infringement of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. From a decree granting the relief prayed, the case comes here on appeal under sections 238(3), 266, Judicial Code, as amended ( 28 \nU.S.C.A.  345(3), 380).\n  The challenged statute defines 'caravaning' as the transportation, 'from without the State of any motor vehicle operated on its own wheels, or in tow of another motor vehicle, for the purpose of selling or offering the same for sale * * * to any purchaser' located within or without the state. Sections 2 and 3 prohibit caravaning without attaching to each vehicle so transported a special permit issued by the State Motor Vehicle Department, for which a fee of $15 is exacted. A permit is valid only for the trip or trips specified in it, and for a period of ninety days ( section 4). Section 6 directs that the fees collected be paid into the general fund in the state treasury, and declares that they are 'intended to reimburse the State treasury for the added expense which the State may incur in the administration and enforcement of this act and the added expense of policing the highways over which such caravaning may be conducted, so as to provide for \n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 293]\n\u00a0\n the safety of traffic on such highways where caravaning is being conducted.'\n  Appellee, a resident of Los Angeles, California, carries on his business there as a dealer in automobiles. He purchases used automobiles in other states and transports them from the place of purchase to points on the California boundary line, thence over state highways to Los Angeles, and sometimes to other places, where he offers them for sale. He conducts from 20 to 25 per cent. of the total movement in such traffic. Some of his vehicles are coupled together in twos, and move in caravans or fleets, sometimes aggregating more than 30 cars. He gave testimony, which appellants sharply challenge, that from 30 to 40 per cent. move singly and not in company with any other vehicle. A permit is required for each car, whether it moves alone or as part, of a fleet. The District Court found that such movement of vehicles in caravans of more than four create special traffic difficulties, but that the movement of four or less 'constitutes no police problem'; that there is considerable like traffic carried on wholly within the state, for which the fee of $15 is not exacted and for which no similar or other fee is required; and that the demanded fee for each car moving in the interstate traffic is excessive and bears no reasonable relation to the increased cost of policing. It concluded, as the appellee contends here, that the statute denies to appellee due process and equal protection, and places a forbidden burden on, and discriminates against, interstate commerce.\n  We find it necessary to consider only the contention that the licensing provisions burden interstate commerce. We do not discuss appellants' suggestion that, contrary to the finding below, there is no evidence of comparable traffic moving intrastate, and hence no discrimination against interstate commerce by the failure of the act to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 294]\n\u00a0\n exact a fee of those engaged in intrastate commerce. It is not denied that the permit fee, imposed upon those engaged in interstate commerce, burdens this commerce, but appellants urge that it is a permissible charge for the use of the state highways and for the cost of policing the traffic, including the cost of administering the Act.\n  In Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407\n, recently before this Court, the Caravaning Act of New Mexico, containing some features similar to the present act, was likewise assailed as burdening interstate commerce by the imposition of a fee, of $7.50 for each vehicle moving by its own power, and $5 for each vehicle towed by another when moving in caravan. The statute made the privilege of using the highway conditional upon payment of the fee. The fees collected were devoted in part to highway purposes. We held that the fees were a charge for the use of the highways, not shown by the taxpayer to be unreasonable, which the state might lawfully demand. Compare Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 624\n; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 249\n, 250, 231.\n  To justify the exaction by a state of a money payment burdening interstate commerce, it must affirmatively appear that it is demanded as reimbursement for the expense of providing facilities, or of enforcing regulations of the commerce which are within its constitutional power. Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 170, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 381; Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 259\n; Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama, \n296 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 196. This may appear from the statute itself, Morf v. Bingaman, supra; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 703, or from the use of the money collected, to defray such expense. Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169, 173\n, 144; see Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 168\n, 169; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Pub. Serv. Comm., \n295 \nU.S. 285\n, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 295]\n\u00a0\n 289, 710; compare Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 249\n.\n  Here appellant does not show that the fees collected are used to meet the cost of the construction or maintenance of its highways. Section 6 of the challenged act, which directs that the permit fees be paid into the general fund of the state treasury, is to be contrasted with other California statutes relating to motor vehicles, which exact license fees and taxes and direct that they be paid, at least in part, into special funds devoted to highway purposes. Motor Fuel License Act,  13, Cal.Stat. 1923, c. 267 (page 575), as amended, Cal.Stat.1935, c. 624 (page 1760); Vehicle Code,  776, 781, Cal.Stat.1935, c. 27 (pages 244, 246); Cal.Stat. 1935, c. 362,  9(a), 9(d) (page 1314). See Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 188\n-190, 381, 382. Appellants point to no statute appropriating any part of the general fund of the state treasury for highway purposes and the Street and Highways Code,  183, Cal.Stat.1935, c. 29 (page 265), provides: 'With the exception of money authorized by law to be deposited in the State highway general fund, all money available for the acquisition of real property or interests therein for State highways, or for the construction, maintenance or improvement of State highways or highways in State parks shall be deposited in the State highway fund.'\n  Hence we must look to the statute itself to ascertain the purposes for which the permit fees are collected. On this point it is explicit. It declares (section 6) that they are intended to reimburse the state treasury for the added expense of administering the Caravan Act and policing the caravaning traffic. This negatives any inference of the purpose of the collection which might otherwise be drawn from the statute, and from its provision that the permit is prerequisite to the use of the highways. Compare Morf v. Bingaman, supra. It is true that this declaration is not an appropriation of the moneys collected \n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 296]\n\u00a0\n and it does not foreclose the use of the fund for highway maintenance, should the state elect to do so. But until such appropriation is made the statute itself states the legislative purpose, and precludes state officials from asserting that the fees are collected for any other.\n  The burden rests on appellee to show that the fee is excessive for the declared purpose. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 624\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 250\n, 231; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 407, 410\n, 757. But the trial court has found that it is excessive and the finding is amply supported by evidence. In 1934, 9,663 cars were caravaned, and in the first eleven months of 1935, 14,000. This supports the inference of the trial court that 15,000 cars are brought into the state, annually, for sale under the conditions defined in the act. There was testimony that the expense involved in issuing caravaning permits is 'about $5.00 per car,' although it appeared that the permit fee for local pleasure, cars, numbering 1,960, 000, was $3 per year, of which only 35 per cent. ($1.05) is devoted to administrative expenses.\n  The Caravan Act became effective September 15, 1935. A permit granted under it is confined to a limited movement from the state boundary to the immediate point of destination. The undisputed evidence shows that prior to the passage of the measure two new district inspectors were appointed solely on account of caravaning, and fourteen new highway patrolmen were 'assigned,' partially because of caravaning and its effect on traffic. The chief of the California highway patrol, in summarizing this testimony, said that he had put on 'approximately six additional men over the whole state because there were caravans on the road, and I anticipate putting on more men.' They receive a monthly salary of $170, which may eventually be increased to $225. The District Court found that the evidence indi- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 290\n, 297]\n\u00a0\n cated that a total of ten men at a salary of $200 a month, and at an aggregate cost of $24,000 a year, would be adequate to police the traffic, whereas the permit fees from 15,000 cars would yield an annual return of $ 225,000.\n  We cannot say that the evidence does not support the conclusion of the trial court that the cost of policing would be amply met by a license fee of one-third of the amount so charged. The administrative expense of issuing the permits appears not to have been included, but the testimony that that expense was about $5.00 per car does not bridge the arithmetical gap, and does not impeach the court's conclusion that the permit fee bears no reasonable relation to the total cost of regulation, to defray which it is collected. It rightly held that the licensing provisions of the statute impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n  On this record we are not required to consider whether the provisions of section 2 which make it unlawful 'to operate three or more vehicles or groups of vehicles in caravan unless a space of at least one hundred fifty feet shall at all times be maintained between each vehicle or group of vehicles being so caravaned' may be enforced if applied, independently of the licensing provisions, in a statute nondiscriminatory in its operation.\n  Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIOWA CITY LIGHT & POWER CO. v.

Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This is an appeal from the final decree of a specially constituted District Court of three judges for the Southern District of New York denying an interlocutory injunction and dismissing the appellant's bill for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. \n1\n The suit was brought to restrain enforcement of an order issued November 18, 1935, by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 21 of the Shipping Act 1916,2 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 141]\n\u00a0\n requiring the appellant to file with the Secretary on December 16, 1935, a copy or summary of its books and records for the period September 1 to November 12, 1935, which should show each commodity carried from the United States to a foreign country, with point of shipment, point of destination, and rate charged or collected, the effective date of the rate, and transshipment and terminal charges and rules affecting rates or value of the service rendered. The order recites that it appears full information as to rates in connection with transportation of certain property from the United States to foreign countries by carriers by water in foreign commerce subject to the Shipping Act 1916 is necessary to the proper administration of the regulatory provisions of the act and that the appellant is engaged in such transportation.\n  The complaint sets forth five causes of action. The first is that the order is invalid because Congress did not intend by the Legislative Appropriation Act of 19323 to authorize the President to abolish the Shipping Board and transfer its functions to an executive officer such as the Secretary of Commerce and that if Congress did so intend the act is unconstitutional as attempting to make the head of an executive department also a judicial officer \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 142]\n\u00a0\n and a legislative officer of the United States and in failing to set up an adequate declaration of policy or standard of action, and, further, that the President promulgated the order of transfer without adequate hearings or findings of fact on which to base it.\n  The second cause of action is that the Secretary's order is invalid as in substance the attempt of a competitor to regulate or stabilize the appellant's rates and to compel it to charge rates fixed by a shipping monopoly of which appellant's competitor is a member. The charge is that before the order was issued the Secretary had transferred all his Shipping Board functions to one Peacock, who was president of a private shipping corporation (the United States Merchant Fleet Corporation) which was actively operating vessels in competition with those of appellant and was a member of a conference or shipping combination whose interests were opposed to those of appellant, which is an independent or nonconference operator; and that the order had been issued for the financial benefit of the competitor. The further allegation is that the constitutional separation of powers between legislative, judicial, and executive branches and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution forbid the exercise of regulatory or quasi judicial functions such as were entrusted to the United States Shipping Board by persons or agencies having the interests described and require that the Secretary's order be held for naught.\n  The third cause of action is that the order was issued not for a public purpose authorized by Congress but in furtherance of a concerted plan to compel the appellant, an independent nonconference carrier, either to join a conference or shipping monopoly, or else suffer damage by disclosure to competitors of current business records showing rates charged and commodities transported. The Secretary's order is alleged to have been issued to promote and foster a monopoly of appellant's competitors. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 143]\n\u00a0\n  The fourth cause of action is that the order is an unjust discrimination against appellant which is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment because it requires appellant to file a record of actual transactions whereas the Secretary requires appellant's competitors, the conference lines or members of the shipping combination, merely to file general rate schedules for the future which are not always observed and need not be observed. Further, that the order issued under section 21 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  820) entails penalties for disobedience whereas orders issued by the Secretary to appellant's competitors were not issued under section 21 or any other section of the act, carried no penalties for nonobservance, and called only for information which those competitors were already required by law to file under section 15 of the Shipping Act of 19164 because of their having joined in a conference or shipping combination.\n  The fifth cause of action is that the order should be enjoined because the Secretary rejected appellant's offer to file records on condition that they would not be communicated to appellant's competitors to the damage of appellant and because the Secretary stated his purpose was to turn the records over to the public which would result in fostering unfair competition and ruin appellant's business. It is charged that appellant cannot comply with the order without prejudice or losing its equitable, legal, and constitutional rights.\n  An injunction affidavit was filed by the appellant and two reply affidavits by the United States. We find it unnecessary to consider them, as we are of opinion that the decree dismissing the bill must be affirmed.\n  The grounds of complaint fall into two general classes. Upon the assumption that the powers and duties of the Shipping Board were effectively transferred to the Secre- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 144]\n\u00a0\n tary of Commerce the claim is that the order was beyond the statutory authority conferred by the Shipping Act, amounted to an illegal search and seizure, and was invalid because arbitrary and unreasonable. But, in addition, it is asserted that transfer of the Board's powers and duties to the Secretary was unauthorized by action of Congress and, if so authorized, was in violation of the Constitution.\n  First. The order is plainly within the terms of section 21 of the Shipping Act 1916 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  820), which provides: 'The board may require any common carrier by water, or other person subject to this chapter, or any officer, receiver, trustee, lessee, agent, or employee thereof, to file with it any periodical or special report, or any account, record, rate, or charge, or any memorandum of any facts and transactions appertaining to the business of such carrier or other person subject to this chapter. Such report, account, record, rate, charge, or memorandum shall be under oath whenever the board so requires, and shall be furnished in the form and within the time prescribed by the board. Whoever fails to file any report, account, record, rates, charge, or memorandum as required by this section shall forfeit to the United States the sum of $100 for each day of such default.'\n  The appellant suggests that the section grants power merely to subpoena records, reports, and information, to be exercised only in hearings upon complaints of violation of the act. This view ignores the fact that section 27 explicitly authorizes the issuance of subpoenas,5 including subpoenas duces tecum, for hearings upon alleged violations. It is inconceivable that this is mere tautology. The purpose of section 21 is not far to seek. Other sections forbid allowance of rebates, require the filing of agreements fixing or regulating rates, granting special rates, accommodations or privileges, which may be disapproved, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 145]\n\u00a0\n canceled, or modified if the Board finds them unjustly discriminatory or violative of the act, prohibit undue or unreasonable preferences or the cutting of established rates and unjust discrimination between shippers or ports. \n6\n To enable it to perform its functions the Board may well need such information as that which the section gives it power to demand. Indeed the order recites that in this instance such information is so required.\n  Despite its recitals of legitimate purpose, the order, so the complaint alleges, sprang from illegal motives, namely, to regulate and stabilize freight rates for the benefit of carriers belonging to steamship conferences, to compel appellant to join a conference, and to create a monopoly in transoceanic shipping.\n  Aside from the principle that if the order is justified by a lawful purpose, it is not rendered illegal by some other motive in the mind of the officer issuing it,7 the allegations of the complaint are mere conclusions unsupported by any facts pleaded and are, therefore, insufficient. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n  The argument that the order amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure, forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, is answered by the fact that it does not call for the production or inspection of any of appellant's books or papers. 9 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 146]\n\u00a0\n  The complaint asserts the appellant is the only carrier which has been required, pursuant to section 21, to file a record of rates actually charged. The section, however, plainly authorizes the making of such an order directed to a single carrier. Nevertheless, the appellant charges such action is unreasonable and arbitrary and violates the Fifth Amendment. The bill itself discloses the conference carriers have filed schedules of their rates and the act requires that if any contract for a change of those rates is made the new rates may be charged only after the Board has approved the agreement. \n10\n The gravamen of the complaint does not appear to be that the appellant is required to supply information not furnished by the conference lines or different information from that which the conference lines file with the Secretary, but that the conference lines are not compelled to adhere to the rates named in their schedules. There is, however, no showing that this circumstance injures the appellant. The data called for related to rates charged in the past-rates fixed by the appellant without constraint; and the bill makes no charge that compliance with the order will in anywise restrict the appellant's freedom to deviate from those past rates in the future. The case made by the bill fails to exhibit discrimination in fact as between appellant and its competitors, much less arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination.\n  Second. It is earnestly contended that title 4 of the legislative appropriation act of June 30, 1932, as amended,11 did not authorize the abolition of the Shipping Board and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Commerce by executive order. Title 3 of the act (section 306) reorganized the Shipping Board and it is said that Congress would not have taken this action had it \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 147]\n\u00a0\n intended to include the Shipping Board within the scope of section 402 of the act, which defines executive agencies the President may abolish or whose functions he may transfer as 'any commission, * * * board, bureau, division, service, or office in the executive branch of the Government.' That this is true is attested by the fact that section 406 withheld from the President the authority to abolish or transfer the functions of the Shipping Board. But when the act was amended March 3, 1933,12 the prohibition was omitted and the phrase 'independent establishment' was added to the enumeration of executive agencies in section 402. After these changes were made the President, by Executive Order No. 6166, dated June 10, 1933, made the transfer. As required by the act of June 30, 1932, he transmitted a copy of the order to the Congress which adjourned a few days after its receipt. Whatever doubt may be entertained as to the intent of Congress that the Shipping Board should be subject to transfer by the President, and, if so, whether the order lay before Congress the requisite number of days to satisfy the statutory mandate, Congress appears to have recognized the validity of the transfer and ratified the President's action by the appropriation Acts of April 7, 1934,13 March 22, 1935,14 and May 15, 1936,15 all of which make appropriations to the Department of Commerce for salaries and expenses to carry out the provisions of the Shipping Act as amended and refer to the executive order. The appellant insists that these references were casual and are not to be taken as ratifying the President's action. We need not shop to consider the argument since, by the Mer- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 148]\n\u00a0\n chant Marine Act of 1936,16 section 204(a), 46 \nU.S.C.A.  1114(a), the functions of the former Shipping Board are referred to as 'now vested in the Department of Commerce pursuant to section 12 of the President's Executive order (No. 6166.)'\n  It remains to deal with the contentions that Congress lacked the power either to transfer or to ratify the transfer of the duties of the Shipping Board to the Secretary of Commerce by delegating to the President authority so to do by executive order, subject to the approval of Congress, and that the President, in exercising the power delegated to him, exceeded his authority because he acted without notice and hearing and failed in the order adequately to specify the grounds for his action. We find it unnecessary to decide the questions sought to be raised in this connection. On June 29, 1936, Congress adopted the Merchant Marine Act. By section 204( a) of that statute (46 \nU.S.C.A.  1114(a) it was provided: 'All the functions, powers and duties vested in the former United States Shipping Board by the Shipping Act, 1916, * * * and amendments, * * * and now vested in the Department of Commerce pursuant to section 12 of the President's Executive order of June 10, 1933, are hereby transferred to the United States Maritime Commission.' The Commission is created by the act. By section 204(b), 46 \nU.S.C.A.  1114(b) it is authorized to adopt all necessary rules and regulations to carry out the powers, duties, and functions vested in it by the act. October 21, 1936, after organization, the Commission promulgated an order (General Order No. 2)17 in which it declared: '* * * all orders, * * * which have been issued or authorized by * * * the Department of Commerce, in the exercise of the functions, powers, and duties transferred \n\n[300 \nU.S. 139\n, 149]\n\u00a0\n to this Commission by the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and which are in effect at the time of such transfer, shall continue in effect, insofar as not in conflict with said Act, until modified, terminated, superseded, or repealed by this Commission or by operation of law; * * *'\n  We are of opinion that the act of 1936 and the Commission's order render moot the constitutional questions sought to be raised by the appellant even though we assume, without deciding, that the Secretary of Commerce had no power to issue the order of November 18, 1935. That order was administrative in character. It determined no rights and prescribed no duties of the appellant as an ocean carrier. It demanded the filing of data. No notice or hearing was prerequisite to its issue. It was still in fieri when the United States Maritime Commission came into existence. By virtue of the action of that Commission it is continued in force and the appellant is commanded to obey it. The appellant concedes that if the order was within the constitutional and statutory powers of the Shipping Board, and had been made by that Board, there could be no question of its validity. As it has become an outstanding administrative order of a Commission having the powers and duties formerly vested in the Shipping Board the appellant is in no position to contend that, as it now affects the appellant, the order is void because issued in the alleged unconstitutional exercise of the powers of the Shipping Board by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  The decree is affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 14 F.Supp. 407.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of Sept. 7, 1916, c. 451,  21, 39 Stat. 728, 736, 46 \nU.S.C.  820 (46 U.S.C.A.  820). The suit was instituted under section 31 of the Shipping Act, 39 Stat. 738, 46 U.S.C.  830 (46 U.S.C.A.  830), whereby the venue and procedure in suits to restrain enforcement of an order of the Shipping Board is made the same as in similar suits respecting orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States as amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the constitutional validity of a tax imposed by the state of West Virginia upon the gross receipts of respondent under contracts with the United States.\n Respondent, the Dravo Contracting Company, is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the general contracting business, with its principal office and plant at Pittsburgh in that state, and is admitted to do business in the state of West Virginia. In the years 1932 and 1933, respondent entered into four contracts with the United States for the construction of locks and dams in the Kanawha river and locks in the Ohio river, both navigable streams. \n1\n The State Tax Commissioner assessed respondent for the years 1933 and 1934 in the sum of $135,761.51 (taxes and penalties) upon the gross amounts received from the United States under these contracts.\n Respondent brought suit in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of West Virginia \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n to restrain the collection of the tax. The case was heard by three judges ( 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380) and upon findings the court entered a final decree granting a permanent injunction. 16 F.Supp. 527. The case comes here on appeal.\n The statute is known as the Gross Sales and Income Tax Law. Code of West Virginia 1931, c. 11, art. 13,  1 et seq., amended effective May 26, 1933. Acts 1933, 1st Ex.Sess., c. 33. It provides for 'annual privilege taxes' on account of 'business and other activities.' The clause in question here is as follows: 'Upon every person engaging or continuing within this state in the business of contracting, the tax shall be equal to two per cent. of the gross income of the business.' \n2\n Acts W.Va.1933, 1st Ex.Sess., c. 33,  2(e).\n The tax was in addition to other state taxes upon respondent, to wit, the license tax on foreign corporations (Code of West Virginia, c. 11, art. 12,  69, 71) and ad valorem taxes upon real and personal property of the contractor within the state.\n The questions presented are: (1) Whether the state had territorial jurisdiction to impose the tax; and (2) whether the tax was invalid as laying a burden upon the operations of the federal government.\n After hearing, we directed reargument and requested the Attorney General of the United States to present the views of the government upon the two questions above stated. Reargument has been had, and the government has been heard.\n First. As to territorial jurisdiction. Unless the activities which are the subject of the tax were carried on within the territorial limits of West Virginia, the state had no jurisdiction to impose the tax. Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina ex rel. Maxwell, \n283 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 134 S., 51 S. Ct. 385, 388, 389; Shaffer v. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S.Ct. 221, 227; Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, 50 S.Ct. 455. The question has two aspects: (1) As to work alleged to have been done outside the exterior limits of West Virginia; and (2) as to work done within those limits but (a) in the bed of the rivers, (b) on property acquired by the federal government on the banks of the rivers, and (c) on property leased by respondent and used for the accommodation of his equipment.\n\n 1. \nA large part of respondent's work was performed at its plant at Pittsburgh. The stipulation of facts shows that respondent purchased outside the state of West Virginia materials used in the manufacture of the roller gates, lock gates, cranes, substructure racks and spur rims, structural steel, patterns, hoisting mechanism and equipment, under each of its contracts, and fabricated the same at its Pittsburgh plant. The roller gates and the appurtenant equipment were preassembled at respondent's shops at Pittsburgh, and were there inspected and tested by officers of the United States government. The materials and equipment fabricated at Pittsburgh were there stored until time for delivery, and the appropriate units as prepared for shipment were then transported by respondent to the designated sites in West Virginia and there installed. The United States knew at the time the contracts were made that the above- described work was to be performed at the plaintiff's main plant. The contracts provided for partial payments as the work progressed, and that all the material and work covered by the partial payments should thereupon become 'the sole property of the government.' Payments by the government were made from time to time accordingly.\n It is clear that West Virginia had no jurisdiction to lay a tax upon respondent with respect to this work done in Pennsylvania. As to the material and equipment there fabricated, the business and activities of respond- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n ent in West Virginia consisted of the installation at the respective sites within that state, and an apportionment would in any event be necessary to limit the tax accordingly. Hans Rees' Sons v. North Carolina, supra.\n\n 2. \nAs to work done within the exterior limits of West Virginia, the question is whether the United States has acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the respective sites. Wherever the United States has such jurisdiction the state would have no authority to lay the tax. Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra.\n\n\n (a)\n As to the beds of the Kanawha and Ohio rivers. The present question is not one of the paramount authority of the Federal Government to have the work performed for purposes within the federal province ( Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 \nU.S. 141, 163\n, 21 S.Ct. 48; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 61\n, 62 S., 33 S.Ct. 667; Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, \n229 \nU.S. 82, 88\n, 33 S.Ct. 679, 680, Ann.Cas.1915A, 232), or whether the tax lays a burden upon governmental operations; it is simply one of territorial jurisdiction.\n The title to the beds of the rivers was in the state. Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 230; Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 26\n, 14 S.Ct. 548; Port of Seattle v. Oregon-Washington R.R. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 41 S.Ct. 237, 239; Borax Consolidated v. Los Angeles, \n296 \nU.S. 10, 15\n, 16 S., 56 S.Ct. 23, 26. It was subject to the power of Congress to use the lands under the streams 'for any structure which the interest of navigation, in its judgment, may require.' Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, supra. But, although burdened by that servitude, the state held the title. Gibson v. United States, \n166 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 272 S., 17 S.Ct. 578; Port of Seattle v. Oregon-Washington R.R. Co., supra; Borax Consolidated v. Los Angeles, supra. There does not appear to have been any acquisition by the United States of title to those lands, unless, as respondent urges, the occupation of the beds for the purpose of the improvements constituted an acquisition of title. But as the occupation was simply the exercise of the dominant \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n right of the federal government (Gibson v. United States, supra, \n166 \nU.S. 269\n, at page 276, 17 S.Ct. 578) the servient title continued as before. No transfer of that title appears. The Solicitor General conceded in his argument at bar that the state of West Virginia retained its territorial jurisdiction over the river beds, and we are of the opinion that this is the correct view.\n\n\n (b)\n As to lands acquired by the United States by purchase or condemnation for the purposes of the improvements. Lands were thus acquired on the banks of the rivers from individual owners and the United States obtained title in fee simple. Respondent contends that by virtue of article 1, section 8, clause 17, of the Federal Constitution, the United States acquired exclusive jurisdiction. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Clause 17 provides that Congress shall have power 'to exercise exclusive Legislation' over 'all Places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.' 'Exclusive legislation' is consistent only with exclusive jurisdiction. Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, at page 652, 50 S.Ct. 455, 456. As we said in that case, it is not unusual for the United States to own within a state lands which are set apart and used for public purposes. Such ownership and use without more do not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state. They lands 'remain part of her territory and within the operation of her laws, save that \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n the latter cannot affect the title of the United States or embarrass it in using the lands or interfere with its right of disposal.' Id., at page 650 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 455, 456. Clause 17 governs those cases where the United States acquires lands with the consent of the Legislature of the state for the purposes there described. If lands are otherwise acquired, and jurisdiction is ceded by the state to the United States, the terms of the cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed, that is, consistently with the carrying out of the purpose of the acquisition, determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction. Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co. v. Lowe, \n114 \nU.S. 525, 527\n, 538 S., 539, S.Ct. 995, 997; Palmer v. Barrett, \n162 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 403 S., 16 S.Ct. 837; Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439, 451\n, 49 S.Ct. 227, 229; United States v. Unzeuta, \n281 \nU.S. 138, 142\n, 50 S.Ct. 284, 285; Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra.\n Are the locks and dams in the instant case 'needful buildings' within the purview of clause 17? The state contends that they are not. If the clause were construed according to the rule of ejusdem generis, it could be plausibly contended that 'needful buildings' are those of the same sort as forts, magazines, arsenals, and dockyards; that is, structures for military purposes. And it may be that the thought of such 'strongholds' was uppermost in the minds of the framers. Elliot's Debates, volume 5, pp. 130, 440, 511; Cf. Story on the Constitution, volume 2,  1224. But such a narrow construction has been found not to be absolutely required and to be unsupported by sound reason in view of the nature and functions of the national government which the Constitution established.\n In Sharon v. Hill (C.C.) 24 F. 726, 730, 731, Justice Field (sitting with Judge (Sawyer) considered the provision to be applicable to a court building and custom house on land which had been purchased with the consent of the state. In Battle v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 36, 37\n, 28 S.Ct. 422, 423, we held that 'post offices are among the 'other needful \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n buildings\" within clause 17. See, also, United States v. Wurtzbarger (D.C.) 276 F. 753, 755; Arlington Hotel v. Fant, supra. Locks and dams for the improvement of navigation, which are as clearly within the federal authority as post offices, have been regarded as 'needful buildings.' United States v. Tucker (D.C.) 122 F. 518, 522, We take that view. We construe the phrase 'other needful buildings' as embracing whatever structures are found to be necessary in the performance of the functions of the federal government.\n The Legislature of West Virginia by general statute had given its consent to the acquisition by the United States, but questions are presented as to the construction and effect of the consent. The provision is found in section 3 of chapter 1, article 1, of the Code of West Virginia of 1931. The full text is set out in the margin. \n4\n By the first paragraph the consent of the state is given 'to the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n acquisition by the United States, or under its authority, by purchase, lease, condemnation, or otherwise, of any land acquired, or to be acquired in this State by the United States, from any individual, body politic or corporate, for sites for ... locks, dams, ... or any needful buildings or structures or proving grounds, or works for the improvement of the navigation of any watercourse ... or for any other purpose for which the same may be needed or required by the government of the United States.' By the second paragraph provision is made for gifts by municipalities to the United States of land for any of the purposes described in the first paragraph. The third paragraph cedes to the United States 'concurrent jurisdiction with this State in and over any land so acquired ... for all purposes.' The jurisdiction so ceded is to continue only during the ownership of the United States and is to cease if the United States \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n fails for five consecutive years to use any such land for the purposes of the grant.\n By a further provision in section 45 the state reserves the right to execute process within the limits of the land acquired, 'and such other jurisdiction and authority over the same as is not inconsistent with the jurisdiction ceded to the United States by virtue of such acquisition.'\n The contention is made that the third paragraph of section 3 as to 'concurrent jurisdiction' was not in the Code of 1923, but was a later addition (1931), and should not be taken as qualifying the first paragraph. But the third paragraph was added before the acquisition here in question, and 'any land so acquired' manifestly refers to the acquisitions previously described which expressly embraced all such acquisitions in the future. The suggestion that the third paragraph applies only to the lands given by municipalities to the United States under the second paragraph is without force. The third paragraph appears to have been taken from the provision, in the same language, of section 19 of the Code of Virginia of 1919, which was not qualified by any intervening provision as to municipalities. See Code of West Virginia, 1931, c. 1, art. 1,  3, Revisers' Note. The revisers say it was added to 'make more definite the provisions as to jurisdiction.' Id. We are not referred to any decision of the Supreme Court of West Virginia construing this paragraph.\n Reference is also made to the provision of section 4 as to service of process. This is said to be unnecessary if only concurrent jurisdiction is granted. But this provision \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 146]\n\u00a0\n was a part of the former statute (1923) and cannot be taken as derogating from the force of the explicit amendment by the later addition in the third paragraph of the present section 3. And apparently to prevent misunderstanding, there was an amendment at the same time of the provision now in section 4 by the addition of the last clause6 in order to make the reservation of the state's jurisdiction 'more comprehensive.' Code of West Virginia, 1931, c. 1, art. 1,  4, Revisers' Note.\n The third paragraph of section 3 carefully defines the jurisdiction ceded by the state, and there is no permissible construction which would ignore this definite expression of intention in considering the effect upon jurisdiction of the consent given by the first paragraph.\n But it is urged that if the paragraph be construed as seeking to qualify the consent of the state, it must be treated as inoperative. That is, that the state cannot qualify its consent, which must be taken as carrying with it exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of clause 17. The point was suggested by Justice Story in United States v. Cornell, Fed.Cas.No.14, 867, 2 Mason 60, 65, 66, but the construction placed upon the consent in that case made decision of the point unnecessary. There the place (Fort Adams in Newport Harbor) had been purchased with the consent of the state, to which was added a reservation for the service of civil and criminal process. Justice Story held that such a reservation was not incompatible with a cession of exclusive jurisdiction to the United States, as the reservation operated 'only as a condition' and 'as an agreement of the new sovereign to permit its free exercise as quoad hoc his own process.' Reservations of that sort were found to be frequent in grants made by the states to the United States in order to avoid the granted places being made a sanctuary for fugitives from justice. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 147]\n\u00a0\n Story on the Constitution, volume 2,  1225. Reference is made to statements in the general discussion in the opinion in Fort Leavenworth R. R. Co. v. Lowe, supra, but these are not decisive of the present question. The decision in that case was that the state retained its jurisdiction to tax the property of a railroad company within the Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation, as federal jurisdiction had not been reserved when Kansas was admitted as a state and, when the state subsequently ceded jurisdiction to the United States, there was saved to the state the right 'to tax railroad, bridge, and other corporations, their franchises and property, on said reservation.' The terms of the cession in this respect governed the extent of the federal jurisdiction. See Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra. There are obiter dicta in other cases, but the point now raised does not appear to have been definitely determined.\n It is not questioned that the state may refuse its consent and retain jurisdiction consistent with the governmental purposes for which the property was acquired. The right of eminent domain inheres in the federal government by virtue of its sovereignty, and thus it may, regardless of the wishes either of the owners or of the states, acquire the lands which it needs within their borders. Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 372 S.. In that event, as in cases of acquisition by purchase without consent of the state, jurisdiction is dependent upon cession by the state, and the state may qualify its cession by reservations not inconsistent with the governmental uses. Story on the Constitution, volume 2,  1227; Kohl v. United States, supra, \n91 \nU.S. 367\n, at page 374; Fort Leavenworth R.R. Co. v. Lowe, supra; Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra; United States v. Unzeuta, supra. The result to the federal government is the same whether consent is refused and cession is qualified by a reservation of concurrent jurisdiction, or consent to the acquisition is granted with a like \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 148]\n\u00a0\n qualification. As the Solicitor General has pointed out, a transfer of legislative jurisdiction carries with it not only benefits, but obligations, and it may be highly desirable, in the interest both of the national government and of the state, that the latter should not be entirely ousted of its jurisdiction. The possible importance of reserving to the state jurisdiction for local purposes which involve no interference with the performance of governmental functions is becoming more and more clear as the activities of the government expand and large areas within the states are acquired. There appears to be no reason why the United States should be compelled to accept exclusive jurisdiction or the state be compelled to grant it in giving its consent to purchases.\n Normally, where governmental consent is essential, the consent may be granted upon terms appropriate to the subject and transgressing no constitutional limitation. Thus, as a state may not be sued without its consent and 'permission is altogether voluntary,' it follows 'that it may prescribe the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued.' Beers use of Platenius v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529; Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 442 S., 20 S.Ct. 919. Treaties of the United States are to be made with the advice and consent of the Senate, but it is familiar practice for the Senate to accompany the exercise of this authority with reservations. Hyde, International Law, volume 2,  519. The Constitution provides that no state without the consent of Congress shall enter into a compact with another state. It can hardly be doubted that in giving consent Congress may impose conditions. See Arizona v. California, \n292 \nU.S. 341, 345\n, 54 S.Ct. 735, 736\n\n\n Clause 17 contains no express stipulation that the consent of the state must be without reservations. We think that such a stipulation should not be implied. We are unable to reconcile such an implication with the freedom of the state and its admitted authority to refuse \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 149]\n\u00a0\n or qualify cessions of jurisdiction when purchases have been made without consent, or property has been acquired by condemnation. In the present case, the reservation by West Virginia of concurrent jurisdiction did not operate to deprive the United States of the enjoyment of the property for the purposes for which it was acquired, and we are of the opinion that the reservation was applicable and effective.\n [c] As to property leased by respondent and used for the accommodation of its equipment. There can be no question as to the jurisdiction of the state over this area.\n We conclude that, so far as territorial jurisdiction is concerned, the state had authority to lay the tax with respect to the respondent's activities carried on at the respective dam sites.\n Second. Is the tax invalid upon the ground that it lays a direct burden upon the federal government? The Solicitor General, speaking for the government, supports the contention of the state that the tax is valid. Respondent urges the contrary.\n The tax is not laid upon the government, its property, or officers. Dobbins v. Erie County Commissioners, 16 Pet. 435, 449, 450.\n The tax is not laid upon an instrumentality of the government. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S.Ct. 171; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1; Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S.Ct. 121; People of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, \n299 \nU.S. 401\n, 57 S.Ct. 269. Respondent is an independent contractor. The tax is nondiscriminatory.\n The tax is not laid upon the contract of the government. Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, 9 Wheat. 738, at page 867; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468, 475; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 581\n, 582 S., 586, 15 S.Ct. 673, 691; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, \n105 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 466 S.; \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 150]\n\u00a0\n Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 646\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380; Williams v. City of Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 418\n, 419 S., 33 S.Ct. 116, 119; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, supra; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S.Ct. 125, 71 A.L.R. 1260; Panhandle Oil Company v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 222\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 452, 56 A.L.R. 583; Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 574\n, 51 S.Ct. 601, 602; Graves v. Texas Company, \n298 \nU.S. 393, 401\n, 56 S.Ct. 818, 822. The application of the principle which denies validity to such a tax has required the observing of close distinctions in order to maintain the essential freedom of government in performing its functions, without unduly limiting the taxing power which is equally essential to both nation and state under our dual system. In Weston v. Charleston, supra, and Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, taxes on interest from government securities were held to be laid on the government's contract, upon the power to borrow money, and hence were invalid. But we held in Willcuts v. Bunn, supra, that the immunity from taxation does not extend to the profits derived by their owners upon the sale of government bonds. We said (Id., at page 225 of 282 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 125, 127, 71 A.L.R. 1260): 'The power to tax is no less essential than the power to borrow money, and, in preserving the latter, it is not necessary to cripple the former by extending the constitutional exemption of taxation to those subjects which fall within the general application of non- discriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government.' Many illustrations were given.\n In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, supra, a specific state tax was imposed on each message sent by an officer of the United States on public business over the lines of the Telegraph Company. In holding the tax to be invalid, the Court leaned heavily upon the fact that the Company had accepted the terms of the Act of Congress of 1866 (14 Stat. 221) authorizing the use of the military and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 151]\n\u00a0\n post roads and requiring in return that government messages have priority over all other business, and be transmitted at rates fixed annually by the Postmaster General. The Court considered that the Company had thus become an agent of the government for the transmission of messages on public business. See, to the same effect, Leloup v. Port of Mobile, supra. The same point was taken in Williams v. City of Talladega, supra, involving a local license fee applicable to the same Telegraph Company. The Court said that the tax was laid upon 'the privilege of carrying on a business a part of which is that of a governmental agency constituted under a law of the United States and engaged in an essential part of the public business, communication between the officers and departments of the Federal government.' The emphasis put in these cases upon the effect of the acceptance of the obligation of the act of Congress shows that they cannot be regarded as sustaining the board claim of immunity here advanced.\n In Panhandle Oil Company v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, supra, and Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, supra, the taxes were held to be invalid as laid on the sales to the respective governments; the one being a state tax on a sale to the United States, and the other a federal tax on the sale to a municipal corporation of Massachusetts. A similar result was reached in Graves v. Texas Company, supra. These cases have been distinguished and must be deemed to be limited to their particular facts. Thus, in Wheeler Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572, 579\n, 50 S.Ct. 419, 421, the federal tax on transportation as applied to lumber which the vendor had engaged to sell to a county for public bridges and to deliver f.o.b. at the place of destination at a stated price, was held to be laid not on the sale but on the transportation. Although the transportation was with a view to a definite sale, it was held to be not part of the sale, but preliminary to it, and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 152]\n\u00a0\n 'wholly the vendor's affair.' In Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 383\n, 57 S.Ct. 239, 241, the federal tax as applied to tobacco purchased by a state for use in a state hospital was sustained as a tax upon the manufacture of the tobacco and not upon the sale. Hence, the Court said, 'the effect upon the purchaser was indirect and imposed no prohibited burden.'\n In Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 51 S.Ct. 273, 274, 75 A.L.R. 9, the Court sustained a state tax upon the gross receipts of an independent contractor carrying the mails. The taxpayer operated an automotive stage line. Two-thirds of his gross receipts, upon the whole of which he was taxed, were derived from carriage of United States mails and the remainder from carriage of passengers and freight. The Court found that the property used in earning these receipts was devoted chiefly to carrying the mails, and that without his contract with the government the stage line could not be operated profitably. In upholding the tax upon his gross receipts, we distinguished Panhandle Oil Company v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, supra, saying: 'There was no tax upon the contract for such carriage; the burden laid upon the property employed affected operations of the Federal Government only remotely. ... The facts in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 56 A.L.R. 583, and New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State Board, \n280 \nU.S. 338\n, 50 S.Ct. 111, were held to establish direct interference with or burden upon the exercise of a federal right. The principles there applied are not controlling here.'\n These decisions show clearly the effort of the Court in this difficult field to apply the practical criterion to which we referred in Willcuts v. Bunn, supra, and again in Graves v. Texas Company, supra. There is no ineluctable logic which makes the doctrine of immunity with respect to government bonds applicable to the earnings of an independent contractor rendering services to the gov- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 153]\n\u00a0\n ernment. That doctrine recognizes the direct effect of a tax which 'would operate on the power to borrow before it is exercised' (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra), and which would directly affect the government's obligation as a continuing security. Vital considerations are there involved respecting the permanent relations of the government to investors in its securities and its ability to maintain its credit; considerations which are not found in connection with contracts made from time to time for the services of independent contractors. And in dealing with the question of the taxability of such contractors upon the fruits of their work, we are not bound to consider or decide how far immunity from taxation is to be deemed essential to the protection of government in relation to its purchases of commodities, or whether the doctrine announced in the cases of that character which we have cited deserves revision or restriction.\n The question of the taxability of a contractor upon the fruits of his services is closely analogous to that of the taxability of the property of the contractor which is used in performing the services. His earnings flow from his work; his property is employed in securing them. In both cases, the taxes increase the cost of the work and diminish his profits. Many years ago the Court recognized and enforced the distinction between a tax laid directly upon a government contract or an instrumentality of the United States and a tax upon the property employed by an agent or contractor in performing services for the United States. 'Taxation of the agency is taxation of the means; taxation of the property of the agent is not always, or generally, taxation of the means.' Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 591. In expounding the grounds for the conclusion that the property of the contractor was taxable, the Court envisaged the serious consequences which would follow if immunity \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 154]\n\u00a0\n were maintained. In Union P. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 33, 36, the Court said:\n'It may, therefore, be considered as settled that no constitutional implications prohibit a State tax upon the property of an agent of the government merely because it is the property of such an agent. A contrary doctrine would greatly embarrass the States in the collection of their necessary revenue without any corresponding advantage to the United States. A very large proportion of the property within the States is employed in execution of the powers of the government. It belongs to governmental agents, and it is not only used, but it is necessary for their agencies. United States mails, troops, and munitions of war are carried upon almost every railroad. Telegraph lines are employed in the National service. So are steamboats, horses, stage-coaches, foundries, ship-yards, and multitudes of manufacturing establishments. They are the property of natural persons, or of corporations, who are instruments or agents of the General government, and they are the hands by which the objects of the government are attained. Were they exempt from liability to contribute to the revenue of the States it is manifest the State governments would be paralyzed. While it is of the utmost importance that all the powers vested by the Constitution of the United States in the General government should be preserved in full efficiency, and while recent events have called for the most unembarrassed exercise of many of those powers, it has never been decided that State taxation of such property is impliedly prohibited. ...\n\n'It is, therefore, manifest that exemption of Federal agencies from State taxation is dependent, not upon the nature of the agents, or upon the mode of their constitution, or upon the fact that they are agents, but upon the effect of the tax; that is, upon the question whether the tax does in truth deprive them of power to serve the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 155]\n\u00a0\n government as they were intended to serve it, or does hinder the efficient exercise of their power. A tax upon their property has no such necessary effect. It leaves them free to discharge the duties they have undertaken to perform. A tax upon their operations is a direct obstruction to the exercise of Federal powers.'\n\n The dissenting opinion of Justice Bradley (with whom Justice Field concurred) while considering that the state tax was invalid as applied to property of the Union Pacific Railroad because of its special relation to the government which had chartered it, emphasized the distinction between such a situation as he conceived it and one where the government has entered into a contract for services to aid in the discharge of governmental functions. His observations are strikingly pertinent here. ( Id. at pages 41, 42 of 18 Wall.): 'The case differs toto coelo from that wherein the government enters into a contract with an individual or corporation to perform services necessary for carrying on the functions of government-as for carrying the mails, or troops, or supplies, or for building ships or works for government use. In those cases the government has no further concern with the contractor than in his contract and its execution. It has no concern with his property or his faculties independent of that. How much he may be taxed by, or what duties he may be obliged to perform towards, his State is of no consequence to the government, so long as his contract and its execution are not interfered with. In that case the contract is the means employed for carrying into execution the powers of the government, and the contract alone, and not the contractor, is exempt from taxation or other interference by the State government.'\n The question of immunity from taxation of the earnings of an independent contractor under a government contract arose in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 156]\n\u00a0\n 514, 46 S.Ct. 172. The services were rendered to a political subdivision of a state and the contractor's earnings were held to be subject to the federal income tax. That was a pivotal decision, for we had to meet the question whether the earnings of the contractor stood upon the same footing as interest upon government securities or the income of an instrumentality of government. It is true that the tax was laid upon net income. But if the tax upon the earnings of the contractor had been regarded as imposing a direct burden upon a governmental agency, the fact that the tax was laid upon net income would not save it under the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra. And if the doctrine of the immunity of interest upon government bonds had been deemed to apply, the tax would have been equally bad whether the tax was upon net or gross income. The ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, related to net income. The uniform ruling in such a case has been that the interest upon government securities cannot be included in gross income for the purpose of an income tax computed upon net income. The pith of the decision in the case of Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell is that government bonds and contracts for the services of an independent contractor are not upon the same footing. The decision was a definite refusal to extend the doctrine of cases relating to government securities, and to the instrumentalities of government, to earnings under contracts for labor.\n The reasoning upon which that decision was based is controlling here. We recognized that in a broad sense 'the burden of federal taxation necessarily sets an economic limit to the practical operation of the taxing power of the states, and vice versa.' 'Taxation by either the state or the federal government affects in some measure the cost of operation of the other.' As 'neither government may destroy the other or curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers,' we said that the limi- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 157]\n\u00a0\n tation upon the taxing power of each, so far as it affects the other, 'must receive a practical construction which permits both to function with the minimum of interference each with the other; and that limitation cannot be so varied or extended as seriously to impair either the taxing power of the government imposing the tax ... or the appropriate exercise of the functions of the government affected by it.' Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, at pages 523, 524, 46 S.Ct. 172, 174.\n We said further that the nature of the governmental agencies or the mode of their Constitution could not be disregarded in passing on the question of tax exemption, as it was obvious that an agency might be of such a character or so intimately connected with the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty by the one government 'that any taxation of it by the other would be such a direct interference with the functions of government itself as to be plainly beyond the taxing power.' And it was on that principle that 'any taxation by one government of the salary of an officer of the other, or the public securities of the other, or an agency created and controlled by the other, exclusively to enable it to perform a governmental function,' was prohibited. We concluded that a nondiscriminatory tax upon the earnings of an independent contractor derived from services rendered to the government could not be said to be imposed 'upon an agency of government in any technical sense,' and could not 'be deemed to be an interference with government, or an impairment of the efficiency of its agencies in any substantial way.' Id. at pages 524, 525, of 269 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 172, 175.\n While the Metcalf Case was one of a federal tax, the reasoning and the practical criterion it adopts are clearly applicable to the case of a state tax upon earnings under a contract with the federal government.\n As we have observed, the fact that the tax in the present case is laid upon the gross receipts, instead of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 158]\n\u00a0\n net earnings, is not a controlling distinction. Respondent invokes our decisions in the field of interstate commerce, where a tax upon the gross income of the taxpayer derived from interstate commerce has long been held to be an unconstitutional burden. Philadelphia & Southern M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 126; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 329 S., 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748; Fisher's Blend Station v. Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650, 655\n, 656 S., 56 S.Ct. 608, 610.\n But the difference is plain. Persons have a constitutional right to engage in interstate commerce free from burdens imposed by a state tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it or the receipts as such derived from it. Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), \n230 \nU.S. 352, 400\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. Interstate commerce is not an abstraction; it connotes the transactions of those engaged in it, and they enjoy the described immunity in their own right. Here, respondent's activities at the dam sites are local and not in interstate commerce. Respondent has no constitutional right to immunity from nondiscriminatory local taxation, and the mere fact that the tax in question burdens respondent is no defense. The defense is that the tax burdens the government, and respondent's right is at best a derivative one. He asserts an immunity which, if it exists, pertains to the government and which the government disclaims.\n In Alward v. Johnson, supra, as already noted, the tax was upon gross receipts, and these were derived from a contract for carrying the mails, but the tax was upheld. It there appeared that the tax was in lieu of taxes upon the property and had been treated by the state court as a property tax. But if the tax as actually laid upon the gross receipts placed a direct burden upon the federal government so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because it was in lieu of a tax upon property, or was so characterized. See \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 159]\n\u00a0\n Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 509\n, 510 S., 47 S.Ct. 179, 183, 49 A.L.R. 713.\n In Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, 36 S.Ct. 298, 299, we sustained the tax upon the gross premiums received by a company as surety upon bonds running to the United States for 'internal revenue, customs, United States government officials, United States government contracts and banks for United States deposits,' and 'bonds given in courts of the United States in litigation there pending.' While the challenged tax was 'an exaction for the privilege of doing business,' we held it to be valid as 'mere contracts between private corporations and the United States do not necessarily render the former essential governmental agencies, and confer freedom from state control.' Id., \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, at pages 320, 323, 36 S.Ct. 298, 300. The premiums, of course, were paid by those who were required to obtain the bonds, but the fact that the contracts were with the United States and that the tax was laid upon gross receipts from the writing of such contracts, did not make the tax an invalid exaction.\n In both the Alward Case and that of the Fidelity & Deposit Company, the argument, pressed here, that the state withheld for its use 'a part of every dollar' received by the taxpayer, was equally pertinent and equally unavailing.\n The contention ultimately rests upon the point that the tax increases the cost to the government of the service rendered by the taxpayer. But this is not necessarily so. The contractor, taking into consideration the state of the competitive market for the service, may be willing to bear the tax and absorb it in his estimated profit rather than lose the contract. In the present case, it is stipulated that respondent's estimated costs of the respective works, and the bids based thereon, did not include, and there was not included in the contract price paid to respondent, any specified item to cover the gross receipts \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 160]\n\u00a0\n tax, although respondent knew of the West Virginia act imposing it, and respondent's estimates of cost did include 'compensation and liability insurance, construction bond and property taxes.'\n But if it be assumed that the gross receipts tax may increase the cost to the government, that fact would not invalidate the tax. With respect to that effect, a tax on the contractor's gross receipts would not differ from a tax on the contractor's property and equipment necessarily used in the performance of the contract. Concededly, such a tax may validly be laid. Property taxes are naturally, as in this case, reckoned as a part of the expense of doing the work. Taxes may validly be laid not only on the contractor's machinery, but on the fuel used to operate it. In Trinityfarm Construction Company v. Grosjean, \n291 \nU.S. 466\n, 54 S.Ct. 469, 470, the taxpayer entered into a contract with the federal government for the construction of levies in aid of navigation, and gasoline was used to supply power for taxpayer's machinery. A state excise tax on the gasoline so used was sustained. The Court said that if the payment of the state taxes imposed on the property and operations of the taxpayer 'affects the federal government at all, it at most gives rise to a burden which is consequential and remote and not to one that is necessary, immediate or direct.' But a tax of that sort unquestionably increases the expense of the contractor in performing his service and may, if it enters into the contractor's estimate, increase the cost to the government. The fact that the tax on the gross receipts of the contractor in the Alward Case, supra, might have increased the cost to the government of the carriage of the mails did not impress the Court as militating against its validity.\n There is the further suggestion that if the present tax of 2 per cent. is upheld, the state may lay a tax of 20 per cent. or 50 per cent., or even more, and make it difficult or impossible for the government to obtain \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 161]\n\u00a0\n the service it needs. The argument ignores the power of Congress to protect the performance of the functions of the national government and to prevent interference therewith through any attempted state action. In Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad, supra, the Court pointedly referred to the authority of Congress to prevent such an interference through the use of the taxing power of the state. 'It cannot,' said the Court, 'be so used, indeed, as to defeat or hinder the operations of the National Government; but it will be safe to conclude, in general, in reference to persons and state corporations employed in government service, that when Congress has not interposed to protect their property from state taxation, such taxation is not obnoxious to that objection.' See Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 585; Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Pennsylvania, supra.\n We hold that the West Virginia tax so far as it is laid upon the gross receipts of respondent derived from its activities within the borders of the state does not interfere in any substantial way with the performance of federal functions, and is a valid exaction. The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I regret that I am unable to concur in the Court's opinion. I should not set forth my views in detail were I not convinced the decision runs counter to the settled rule that a state may not, by taxation, burden or impede the United States in the exercise of its delegated powers. The judgment seems to me to overrule, sub silentio, a century of precedents, and to leave the application of the rule uncertain and unpredictable.\n The doctrine which forbids a state to interfere with the exercise of federal powers does not have its origin in the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 162]\n\u00a0\n common-law exemption of the sovereign from regulation or taxation. It springs from the necessity of maintaining our dual system of government. \n1\n 'The attempt to use it (the power of taxation) on the means employed by the government of the Union, in pursuance of the Constitution, is itself an abuse, because it is the usurpation of a power which the people of a single state cannot give. We find, then, on just theory, a total failure of this original right (of the states) to tax the means employed by the government of the Union, for the execution of its powers.' \n2\n 'The immunity is derived from the Constitution in the same sense and upon the same principle that it would be if expressed in so many words.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n This immunity was defined by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436: 'The States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden or in any manner control, the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government.'\n In its application the principle forbids taxation by a state of property of the federal government,4 or of the office or salary of any of its officers. 5 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 163]\n\u00a0\n I agree that the gross receipts tax laid by West Virginia upon the appellee's transactions with the United States is not upon the government as such, upon its property, or upon its officers.\n The government need not perform all its functions by the use of its property and the activity of its officers, but may establish agencies to these ends. Such an agency, created not for private gain but wholly devoted to governmental purposes and wholly owned by the United States, is as free from state taxation on its property and its activities as the government itself; and the exemption extends to the salaries of its officers. \n6\n In the exertion of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, the United States may, in its discretion, erect corporations for private gain and employ them as its instrumentalities. \n7\n No tax can be laid upon their franchises or operations, 8 but their local property9 is subject to nondiscriminating state taxation. In contrast, the bestowal of benefits, rights, privileges, or immunities, or the imposition of duties by federal law upon a natural person or a corporation does not convert him or it into a federal agency exempt from uniform state excise or \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 164]\n\u00a0\n property taxes. \n10\n Where the United States, by contract, constitutes a person or corporation its agent to fulfill a governmental obligation, a state tax upon such an agent is forbidden if it falls upon the avails of the operation in which the government has an interest, or is an excise or privilege tax upon the agent's operations;11 but a general and uniform state property tax which falls only upon the agent's property used in the performance of the contract is valid. \n12\n The opinion of the court adverts to these distinctions, but, since admittedly the appellee is not an agency or instrumentality of the United States, a discussion of taxes laid upon the operations as contrasted with those imposed upon the property of such an agency or instrumentality is beside the point upon which the case turns. \n 13\n\u00a0\n\n I agree that the challenged tax is not, in terms, laid upon the contract of the government, but I am of opinion that it directly burdens and impedes the operations of the United States within the reason and scope of the principle of immunity and according to the application of that principle in numerous decisions of the court. If this be so, the fact that the exaction is not in terms upon the contract with the government, the appellee \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 165]\n\u00a0\n is an independent contractor, the tax is nondiscriminatory, or that it is not excessive in amount cannot serve to exculpate the statute from the charge that it transgresses the rule. These considerations, as repeatedly held, are irrelevant where the tax falls directly, immediately, and palpably upon an operation of the federal government or a means chosen for the exercise of its powers. Many illustrations are available of exactions which plainly burden and impede in some degree the lawful operations of the United States. As the opinion of the court indicates, a tax in terms laid upon the contract would do so; such as an excise for the privilege of making the contract or performing it,14 a stamp tax upon the documents evidencing the contract, or a requirement that the contract be recorded and a tax be paid upon its recordation. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The court has, moreover, repeatedly held a tax nominally upon one who contracts with the government was in effect and in fact imposed upon the operations of the latter. Thus an excise upon a telegraph company which, under contract with the United States, transmits government messages, whether the tax be at a given sum per message16 or in the form of a license tax upon all business, private and governmental,17 is prohibited because it imposes a burden upon the operations of the United States. The cases so holding are sought to be distinguished by the circumstance that the telegraph companies carrying the messages of the United States were by federal statute given the privilege of using the post roads; and it is said that this in some way gave them a peculiar status which rendered their gross receipts un- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 166]\n\u00a0\n taxable. But that was not the basis of decision. The ground of immunity was that the tax was in effect on the government's transactions in the exertion of its lawful powers. Thus in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 \nU.S. 460\n, at page 465, it was said 'The tax is the same on every message sent, and because it is sent. ... Clearly if a fixed tax for every two thousand pounds of freight carried is a tax on the freight, or for every measured ton of a vessel a tax on tonnage, or for every passenger carried a tax on the passenger, or for the sale of goods a tax on the goods, this must be a tax on the messages. ... As to the government messages, it is a tax by the State on the means employed by the government of the United States to execute its constitutional powers, and, therefore, void. It was so decided in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 ( 4 L.Ed. 579), and has never been doubted since.'\n That the privileges granted telegraph companies by federal law, had no bearing upon the validity of the tax is shown by Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530\n, 8 S.Ct. 961 and Attorney General of Massachusetts v. Western Telegraph Co., \n141 \nU.S. 40\n, 11 S.Ct. 889, in which state taxes on the property and franchises of companies, operating under the same statute as the Telegraph Company in the Texas Case were sustained because not on the transactions between the carrier and the United States.\n Stock issued by the United States evidencing indebtedness to the holder cannot be taxed ad valorem by a state. \n18\n A tax upon the assets of a corporation is bad if obligations of the United States are included in the assessment. \n19\n A gross income tax is invalid to the extent \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 167]\n\u00a0\n that it is laid on income from federal securities. \n20\n The reason is that 'the tax ... is a tax upon the contract subsisting between the government and the individual. It bears directly upon that contract, while subsisting and in full force. The power operates upon the contract the instant it is framed and must imply a right to affect that contract.' The government's obligation is for the payment both of principal and interest, and an exaction which bears upon either of these features of the obligation is prohibited.\n Certificates of indebtedness issued by the United States, payable at a future date, with interest, issued to creditors for supplies furnished by them to the nation, cannot be taxed by a state. They differ from the gross receipts here taxed only in the respect that they were issued to secure payment of past-due contractual obligations, whereas the cash paid the appellee was in solution of a present obligation of like nature. Of the taxability of these certificates it was said:21 'But we fail to perceive ... that such certificates, issued as a means of executing constitutional powers of the government other than of borrowing money, are not as much beyond control and limitation by the States through taxation, as bonds or other obligations issued for loans of money.'\n Many sorts of imposts, however, which bear merely upon the obligee of a government contract for the exercise of a privilege having no relation to the contractual nexus between him and the government have been sus- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 168]\n\u00a0\n tained. So, a franchise or privilege tax measured by assets or by income is not rendered void by the circumstance that the taxpayer's assets or income include federal securities or interest thereon. \n22\n And a law which imposes an excise upon the privilege of transmission of property at death may include federal securities in the estate by which the tax is measured. 23 Upon the like reasoning a tax upon moneys and credits in the assessment of which uncollected government checks are included is valid. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n There can be no difference in reason, or in practical effect, between taxation of government contracts to repay borrowed funds or written promises to pay for goods previously furnished and a contract to pay for goods and services as furnished, or any other form of contract whereby the government exercises its granted powers. The federal power to contract for supplies or services is as necessary and as fundamental as the power to borrow money. Thus it has been said, speaking of a tax upon government obligations:25 'If the states and corporations throughout the Union possess the power to tax a contract for the loan of money, what shall arrest this principle in its application to every other contract? What measure can government adopt, which will not be exposed to its influence?'\n If the government, as guardian of an incompetent Indian, leases land to a mining company on a royalty consisting of a percentage of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of ores mined, a state ad valorem tax assessed to the lessee on the ores mined and in storage upon the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 169]\n\u00a0\n leased land before any sale or segregation of the equitable interests of the government as guardian, is void as burdening and impeding an operation of the government. \n26\n A sales tax on commodities sold to the government, though laid upon the seller at a given rate per unit sold, is also bad as directly burdening the government's transactions. 27 A tax on storage or withdrawal from storage essential to the sale of a commodity contracted to be delivered to the United States is in the same class as a tax on sales to the government. \n28\n On the other hand, a sales tax upon articles purchased by a government contractor,29 or a net income tax laid upon his income, is valid. \n30\n The reason is that exactions of the latter sort do not impinge upon or directly affect the transaction between him and the government; do not affect the government's choice of means for executing its powers.\n While a gross income tax upon receipts derived from a government contract would in itself be bad, if the exaction is in lieu of all property taxes and intended as a property tax, measured by receipts of the property, it is valid. \n 31\n\u00a0\n\n Over a century ago the court said:32 'Can a contractor for supplying a military post with provisions, be restrained from making purchases within any state, or from transporting the provisions to the place at which the troops were stationed? or could he be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 170]\n\u00a0\n fined or taxed for doing so? We have not yet heard these questions answered in the affirmative. It is true, that the property of the contractor may be taxed, as the property of other citizens. ... But we do not admit, that the act of purchasing, or of conveying the articles purchased, can be under state control.'\n There is no distinction between a sales tax on goods sold to the federal government and a gross receipts tax upon the furnishing of goods and services under a contract with the government. As was said in Panhandle Oil Company v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 221\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 452, 56 A.L.R. 583: 'The right of the United States to make such purchases is derived from the Constitution. The petitioner's right to make sales to the United States was not given by the State and does not depend on state laws; it results from the authority of the national government under the Constitution to choose its own means and sources of supply. While Mississippi may impose charges upon petitioner for the privilege of carrying on trade that is subject to the power of the State, it may not lay any tax upon transactions by which the United States secures the things desired for its governmental purposes.'\n As in the Panhandle Case, so in the present, the receipt of the thing contracted for constitutes the transaction by which the tax is measured and on which the burden rests. We may thus paraphrase what was there said: To use the value and amount of the goods and services furnished to the United States as a measure of the tax is in substance and effect to tax the transaction itself. The amount of the tax rises and falls in direct ratio to the contract value of the goods and services rendered to the government. This is to tax the sale; and that is to tax the United States.\n The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, proposes a single test of the constitutionality of a state tax upon the operations of the United States, or the means chosen for \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 171]\n\u00a0\n the execution of its powers. That test is whether the taxing statute discriminates against the government and in favor of other taxpayers. He frankly admits that if the proposed criterion be adopted we must overrule Indian Motocycle Company v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570\n, 51 S.Ct. 601; Panhandle Oil Company v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, supra; and Graves v. Texas Company, \n298 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 818. He professes himself, as I am, unable to distinguish a sales tax or a tax upon storage preliminary to sale to the United States from a gross receipts tax upon goods and services furnished the government. In a brief filed as amicus curiae in Graves v. Texas Company, supra, he urged the court to hold such a tax imposed on gasoline under contract to the United States invalid as an unconstitutional impediment and burden upon the operations of the government. 33 It is said that these cases have been distinguished. But in the cases distinguished from them the tax was found to be one on the property of a contractor with the United States, or on its net income, not on the gross receipts of his contract with the government. To distinguish them from the present case is not to rely upon any principle, but upon the mere name or label given to a tax. Such distinctions only serve to confuse.\n I do not think the Solicitor General in brief or argument answered the question propounded by the court in the present case; whether the tax is invalid as laying a burden upon the operations of the federal government. He responds that the tax is valid in spite of the fact that it lays such a burden. Thus he states: 'We have indicated that a tax upon the contractor, the sole result of which is to increase the cost to the sovereign by the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 172]\n\u00a0\n amount of the normal tax burden, presents no interference with its operations.' Again he says that the imposition of the tax in question 'is in no sense a threat to the capacity of the government to perform its functions.'\n Thus it appears that, in his view, a nondiscriminatory state tax is to be judged not by the 'burden' it imposes, but by the extent of its 'interference' with the functioning of government. If this be the test, no tax, however great, can prevent such functioning, so long as the United States' taxing and borrowing powers remain adequate to meet the ordinary expenses of its operations and the added cost of state taxes thereon. The adoption of any such theory would require the overruling not only of the three decisions the Solicitor General singles out for deletion, but literally scores of others, beginning with McCulloch v. Maryland and ending with Graves v. Texas Co., \n298 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 818, decided at the 1935 term in accordance with the views then earnestly pressed upon us by the Solicitor General.\n It is not clear to what extent the court's opinion adopts the doctrine advocated by the government. It is said merely that the appellee is an independent contractor, that the tax is nondiscriminatory and is not laid upon the contract of the government; and it is suggested that if in the view of Congress the burden of such a tax becomes too heavy, Congress has the means of redress. Whether one or all of these factors is requisite to justify the exaction we are not told.\n The cases on which the opinion especially relies do not justify sustaining this tax. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S.Ct. 172, throws no light upon the problem presented. A contractor employed to advise a state and its municipal subdivisions sought exemption from a federal tax upon net income. The law imposing the tax did not discriminate against the receipts from the contract, but treated them as part of the gross income upon which \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 173]\n\u00a0\n the taxable net income was to be calculated. In accordance with all of this court's applicable decisions, the tax was held not to be upon the state or its contract with the taxpayer, not upon an instrumentality or means chosen by the state for executing its powers, not directly upon the amount of the taxpayer's compensation received from the state. The exaction was not as here, of a proportion of each dollar paid by the government. It was upon net income remaining after allowable deductions from gross.\n The decision in Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Pennsylvania, \n240 \nU.S. 319\n, 36 S.Ct. 298, relied on as sustaining the instant exaction, neither rules nor aids in the decision of the present cause. There a foreign surety company was required by law to pay an annual fee equal to 2 per cent. of its gross premiums, in order to be admitted to do business in Pennsylvania. Under a federal statute surety companies desiring to execute bonds running to the United States were required to obtain written authority from the Attorney General so to do. The Fidelity Company obtained such authority and became surety in Pennsylvania on a number of bonds insuring the faithful performance of official duties by federal employees. It challenged so much of the state tax as was laid upon the premiums received for writing these bonds. The challenge was not sustained. The claim that the company, by obtaining leave to execute bonds running to the United States, had become a federal instrumentality, was properly overruled. \n34\n But it is said that, in sustaining the tax, the court held that an exaction on the gross receipts of government contracts is valid. A moment's reflection will show that this is incorrect. The premiums received by the surety company were received from its clients; those for whom it wrote the bonds. It received no compensation from the United States and its transactions in essence were with \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 174]\n\u00a0\n citizens of the state of Pennsylvania as such. They did not differ from transactions with federal officers and employees whereby the latter procured any other sort of goods or service. \n35\n Of course, the mere fact that a contractual relation, that of suretyship, was created between the Fidelity Company and the United States, was not in and of itself sufficient to relieve the company of the burden of paying a local tax for the privilege of doing business with its customers.\n Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509\n, 51 S.Ct. 273, 75 A.L.R. 9, is cited as an instance where a gross receipts tax incident upon the consideration paid the contractor by the United States was sustained. Examination of the case demonstrates that the contrary is true. Alward was engaged in operating an automotive stage line between points in California. In his business he employed automotive property and used the state highways. In classifying property for taxation the state separately classified property of persons carrying on such a business as his and laid a tax on this class of property, in lieu of all other taxes, at the rate of 4 1\/2 per cent. of gross receipts. Other classes of property were taxed at a percentage of value. As the major portion of Alward's gross receipts arose from a contract for carrying United States mails, he insisted that the tax was invalid because, by virtue of his contract with the government, he became a federal agency immune from taxation upon his gross receipts.\n This Court found that the Supreme Court of California had declared the tax one upon property in cases having no relation to its incidence upon federal instrumentalities or means. It further found that the challenged classification for taxation of automotive property used in a business transacted on the public roads was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The case was likened to those arising \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 175]\n\u00a0\n under the commerce clause in which the intrastate property of an interstate carrier was either directly taxed or was taxed by use of a percentage of gross receipts in lieu of all other taxes, including property taxes, in order to reach a fair measure of the taxable value of the carrier's intrastate property. Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330\n, 43 S.Ct. 366; Hopkins v. Southern California Tel. Co., \n275 \nU.S. 393\n, 48 S.Ct. 180. It was pointed out that the tax was not on gross receipts as such, and did not bear upon the contract between the taxpayer and the government. In the instant case, the tax is admittedly an excise for revenue imposed in addition to property taxes and foreign corporation fees paid by the appellee.\n It may be considered, though I do not think with reason, that the conclusion of the court that the tax was a property tax and not a tax upon gross receipts as such was erroneous, but, even if this be conceded, it cannot be contended that the case stands as authority for the proposition that a gross receipts tax as such upon the earnings of a government contractor, from his government contract, is not a burden or impediment upon the operations of the United States within the rule of federal immunity.\n Much stress is laid by the Solicitor General upon the decision in Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 383\n, 57 S.Ct. 239, 240, and he suggests that the views therein stated be adopted in the present case in preference to those embodied in the Panhandle Oil Case, supra. The suggestion implies, contrary to the fact, that the two decisions are contradictory. The Liggett & Myers Company, a manufacturer of tobacco sold a portion of its product to a state. The company resisted the collection of a federal internal revenue tax laid 'upon all tobacco and snuff manufactured in or imported into the United States, and hereafter sold by the manufacturer or importer, or removed for consumption or sale' at a flat rate in cents \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 176]\n\u00a0\n per pound 'to be paid by the manufacturer or importer thereof.' Upon analysis of the statute it was concluded that the tax was upon the manufacture, and that payment was merely postponed until removal or sale. The tax did not vary in amount with the price received for the tobacco, and was not in terms upon its sale. Upon this ground the Indian Motocycle Co. Case and the Panhandle Case were distinguished.\n It may be conceded that often it is difficult to determine whether a tax is laid upon the local operations of a manufacturer or contractor or upon the actual sale of his product. But such distinctions must be made. Indeed, the court itself is required to make such a one in the instant case in determining that payment for what the appellee manufactured for the government in Pittsburgh, Pa., did not constitute a gross receipt in West Virginia under the contract. The court has repeatedly been confronted with the problem whether a tax was in fact on the sale of a commodity or upon some prior dealing with it by the producer or supplier. While the distinctions drawn may seem somewhat nice, examination of the facts carries conviction that the distinctions are substantial. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n It is suggested that the appellee's status as an independent contractor lifts the ban from the tax. This is to ignore the direct bearing of the exaction on the transaction between the contractor and the government. The fact that the tax is laid upon him who contracts with the government rather than upon the contract as such, or the government itself, is immaterial. Every purchaser of government obligations is an independent con- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 177]\n\u00a0\n tractor with the government. If the fact that the taxpayer is an independent contractor were significant, it would have validated every tax laid upon the ownership of government obligations or upon the interest received therefrom. \n37\n It has been held that ores produced by an independent contractor for the government, though still in his possession, cannot be taxed by a state;38 and that a license tax upon an independent contractor cannot be measured by the gross receipts from his transactions with the government. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n What was said by Mr. Justice Bradley, dissenting in Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 38, when read in the light of its context, has no bearing upon the issue here presented. In McCulloch v. Maryland, in holding that a tax upon the operations of the United States Bank invaded the federal immunity, Chief Justice Marshall said: 'It ( the immunity) does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the bank, in common with the other real property within the state.'\n In the Peniston Case, the question was whether a uniform ad valorem state tax could lawfully be assessed upon the intrastate property of the railroad, a federal corporation. The court held that it could. The correctness of the decision has never been doubted. Justices Bradley and Field, however, thought that the scope of the immunity was so broad as to exempt even the local property of a federal instrumentality from such a uniform local tax. It is to be observed that no other kind of exaction was involved. Mr. Justice Bradley insisted that while \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 178]\n\u00a0\n such a tax might lawfully be laid upon the property of one who was a mere contractor with the United States it could not be laid upon the local assets of a federal corporate instrumentality. The challenged tax was not upon the franchise of the corporation granted by the government, not on its right to exist within the state, nor upon the gross receipts from its operations. Confessedly the property of a contractor with the government is more remote from the government's operations than is the property of a government instrumentality. If the latter may be locally taxed a fortiori the former may, and the language of Mr. Justice Bradley applied only to that situation, and not to a gross receipts tax such as we have here.\n Does the fact that the tax is nondiscriminatory save it? The Solicitor General, as we have seen, so argues. He says that both the appellee and the United States derive substantial benefits in connection with the federal projects located in the state, and adds that it seems these benefits should not be free. Though he does not overlook the fact that when the work is completed the United States will continue to receive benefits from the state, he contends that a nondiscriminatory tax upon the gross receipts of the contractor is but a method of reimbursing the state for benefits conferred. The argument proves too much. It requires that equal and uniform state taxation upon federal property on which stand customs houses, post offices, forts, arsenals, et id omne genus, be upheld. In every instance of the ownership and use of property within a state, according to the argument, the federal government receives substantial benefits for which it should pay. The Solicitor General balks at the result of his position. He says: 'We recognize that the logic of our analysis of benefits received would lead to taxation of the sovereign itself. But the attributes of sovereignty may be such as to prevent a tax from being \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 179]\n\u00a0\n imposed upon the government itself. Certainly the principle of the tax immunity of the sovereign itself is too firmly established now to be reexamined.'\n The short answer is that the immunity from state taxation upon the means, the operations, and the instruments of the government is just as firmly established as is the immunity from taxation of the government's property or offices or posts created by it, and that neither class of taxation can be justified by the fact that the burden on the government is uniform with that laid on others.\n Taxes condemned by the court's decisions which were imposed upon the principal and interest of federal securities, upon the product of mining lessees, in which the government had an interest, upon storage and sale of property sold to the government, upon the operation and franchises of federal instrumentalities, such as national banks, were nondiscriminatory. They bore equally and alike upon property and operations in which the government was interested and those which were alien to it, but they were voided as illegally burdening the operations of the United States. The fact that taxes upon government property and upon property of wholly-owned government corporations were nondiscriminatory did not suffice to save them. Taxes on franchises granted by the federal government, taxes upon the office or salary of a federal official, though nondiscriminatory, nevertheless fell under the ban. It was said in Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 41 S.Ct. 16: 'Here the question is whether the State can interrupt the acts of the general government itself. With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how universal and undiscriminating, the State's inability to interfere has been regarded as established since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.'\n The element of discrimination becomes important only in a case where a tax which would otherwise be per- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 180]\n\u00a0\n missible is aimed at the taxpayer because of his relation to the government. Of course a state cannot lay a heavier burden upon those contracting with the government simply because they are such contractors. A discrimination of that nature on its face spells a hostile purpose, an intent to hinder and burden the government, to impede its operations, and to discourage dealing with it. But the question of discrimination has no place in the consideration of the legality of an exaction laid directly upon the government, upon its operations, or upon the means or instrumentalities it has chosen for executing its powers.\n As we have seen, the Solicitor General suggests that the tax should be sustained, although it lays a burden on the United States, because the burden is a 'normal tax burden' and the United States can bear it. The opinion of the court suggests the same thought, and adds that if West Virginia ever imposes a gross receipts tax uniform in its incidence, but inordinately heavy, Congress has power to relieve the government from such interference. Both suggestions are in the teeth of all that has been said by the court on the subject of federal immunity. The necessity for enforcement of the doctrine was embodied in the phrase of Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' As was said in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 60\n, 20 S.Ct. 747, 755: 'This principle is pertinent only when there is no power to tax a particular subject, and has no relation to a case where such right exists. In other words, the power to destroy which may be the consequence of taxation is a reason why the right to tax should be confined to subjects which may be lawfully embraced therein, even although it happens that in some particular instance no great harm may be caused by the exercise of the taxing authority as to a subject which is beyond its scope.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 181]\n\u00a0\n Chief Justice Marshall denied the existence of the power. From that day to this the court has consistently held that the question is not one of quantum, not one of the weight of the burden, but one of power. The court has said that the attempt to tax the means employed by the government is 'the usurpation of a power which the people of a single state cannot give.' Referring to the decision in McCulloch v. Maryland, it was said: 'The decision in that case was not put upon any consideration of degree but upon the entire absence of power on the part of the States to touch, in that way at least, the instrumentalities of the United States; 4 Wheat. 429, 430; and that is the law today.' \n40\n\u00a0\n\n Again the court has said: 'It is obvious that the same power which imposes a light duty can impose a very heavy one, one which amounts to a prohibition. Questions of power do not depend on the degree to which it may be exercised. If it may be exercised at all, it must be exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed. If the tax may be levied in this form by a state, it may be levied to an extent which will defeat the revenue by impost, so far as it is drawn from importations into the particular state.' \n41\n\u00a0\n\n Again it was recently said: 'Where the principle applies it is not affected by the amount of the particular tax or the extent of the resulting interference, but is absolute. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 430; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 17 Wall. 322, 327; Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 56 S., 41 S.Ct. 16; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S.Ct. 171; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44-46.'42\n No one denies the competence of the Congress to waive the immunity in whole or in part. \n43\n But his is the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 182]\n\u00a0\n reverse of saying the power to tax federal means and operations exists in the states subject to veto by Congress of any exorbitant exercise of the power. And it may be pertinent to suggest that, if, as the court has always held, the immunity is reciprocal, the state Legislatures, by a parity of reasoning, ought to have the power to prohibit federal taxes upon state operations, if they be deemed immoderate.\n It must be evident that if the principle of federal immunity is to be preserved, if all that the court has said respecting it is not to be set aside, the gross receipts tax under review cannot be rescued from condemnation by the circumstances that it bears upon an independent contractor, does not discriminate, and is not so burdensome as seriously to interfere with governmental functions.\n Such a tax upon gross receipts has been contrasted in all the decisions, including those dealing with burdens upon commerce, with a tax upon net income; the one being held a forbidden burden and the other a permissible exaction. Despite the fact that the court has repeatedly applied the same tests of validity to taxes alleged to burden interstate commerce as it has to exactions said to burden the operations of the federal government,44 it is said in the opinion:\n'Respondent invokes our decisions in the field of interstate commerce, where a tax upon the gross income of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 183]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer derived from interstate commerce has long been held to be an unconstitutional burden. ...\n\n'But the difference is plain. Persons have a constitutional right to engage in interstate commerce free from burdens imposed by a state tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it or the receipts as such derived from it.'\n\n As has been pointed out, the doctrine of federal immunity from state taxation is based upon the right of the federal government to carry on its lawful operations free from burden or impediment imposed by a state upon the business which constitutes such operations or the privilege of engaging in them. The Constitution contains no clause forbidding the states to burden, impede, or interfere with the operations of the federal government. In express terms it confers upon that government power to conduct those operations. Nor does the Constitution contain any clause prohibiting the states from burdening or interfering with the conduct of interstate commerce. In express terms it confers upon Congress the power to regulate that commerce. In each case there is implied from the federal power delegated by the people an immunity from interference or burden by the states. The cases are entirely analogous. Comparing the immunity of interstate commerce from state taxation with the like immunity of the federal government, the court has said: 'The rule as to instrumentalities of the United States on the other hand is absolute in form and at least stricter in substance.' \n45\n\u00a0\n\n The cases in our reports respecting the immunity of interstate commerce from burden by state taxation are the complete analogue of those dealing with the federal immunity from the like burden. As in the case of a private corporation employed as an agency of the United \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 184]\n\u00a0\n States, so in the case of a private corporation engaged in interstate commerce, the states are free to lay a uniform and nondiscriminatory tax upon the property employed in the business within their jurisdiction. \n46\n\u00a0\n\n A tax upon the gross receipts of corporations derived both from intrastate and interstate commerce is bad because it burdens the latter. \n47\n A franchise tax upon a corporation transacting an interstate business, measured by its interstate business or its property without the state, is void, on the same principle that a tax laid upon the franchise of a corporation which is a federal agency or instrumentality is void. \n48\n\u00a0\n\n A sales tax on gasoline sold within a state is invalid as it affects gasoline purchased outside the state for use therein, for the same reason a sales tax upon sales to the United States in invalid. \n49\n A tax upon the gross receipts of one engaged in interstate commerce is bad be- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 185]\n\u00a0\n cause a direct burden on that commerce in the same sense that a tax on the gross receipts of business done with the United States is a direct burden on the transaction with the federal government. \n50\n In contrast, a tax on the net income of one engaged in interstate commerce is not upon his transactions in that commerce, but so remote therefrom as not to burden it, just as a net income tax upon one who contracts with the federal government is inoffensive to the rule of federal immunity. \n51\n\u00a0\n\n A state may not lay an occupation tax upon the act of engaging in interstate commerce, for the same reason that it may not lay a similar tax upon the employment of an officer of the United States. \n52\n The same considerations of remoteness sustain taxes upon the mere purchase of articles intended for use in interstate commerce or for the fulfillment of government contracts. \n53\n\u00a0\n\n I conclude, then, that the tax in question is plainly imposed upon the operations of the federal government; that it falls squarely within the definition of such a burden and is prohibited upon the principle announced \n\n[302 \nU.S. 134, 186]\n\u00a0\n in McCulloch v. Maryland and ever since consistently applied in the decisions of the court. I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n These views with respect to the nature of the tax render it unnecessary to express any opinion as to the asserted exclusive federal jurisdiction over the area within which the appellee pursued the activities which are the subject of the exaction.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Act of July 3, 1930, c. 847, 46 Stat. 928; H.

Rev.Stat.,  9843 et seq.) relating to the inspection and regulation of vessels. The Supreme Court of the state directed judgment for respondents, holding the statute invalid 'if applied to the navigable waters over which the federal government has control.' 186 Wash. 589, 596, 59 P.(2d) 373, 376. We granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 539\n, 57 S.Ct. 322. After hearing, we ordered reargument, and requested the Attorney General of the United States to present the views of the government upon the question whether the state act or the action of the officers of the state thereunder conflicts with the authority of the United States or with the action of its officers under the acts of Congress. The case has been reargued accordingly, and the views of the government have been presented both orally and upon brief in support of the decision of the state court.\n The material facts, as set forth in the opinion of the state court, are that respondents own and operate 139 motor-driven tugs of which 111 are less than 65 feet in length. Some of these tugs are registered, and the remainder are enrolled and licensed under federal laws. For the most part these tugs are employed in intrastate commerce, but some tow to and from British Columbia ports or across the Columbia river or from other ports in Washington to ports in Oregon. Practically all these tugs are capable of engaging in interstate or foreign commerce, and will do so if and when opportunity offers. Some of the larger tugs have towed and will tow to California ports. The main business, however, of most of the tugs is confined to moving vessels engaged in interstate and foreign commerce and other work in and about the harbors where they are stationed. 186 Wash. 589, 590, 59 P.(2d) 373.\n Respondents' complaint challenged the validity of a large number of requirements of the state act which it was alleged the state authorities sought to enforce (186 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n Wash. 589, 591, 59 P.(2d) 373), but these authorities by their answer and in the argument at bar disclaim an intention to enforce any of the state regulations which conflict with those established under the laws of the United States.\n First. The first question is whether the state legislation as applied to respondents' motor-driven tugs is in all respects in conflict with express provisions of the federal laws and regulations. Wherever such conflict exists, the state legislation must fall. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210.\n Chapter 200 of the Washington Laws of 1907 is described by the state court as 'a comprehensive and complete code for the inspection and regulation of every vesse' operated by machinery which is not subject to inspection under the laws of the United States.' Rem.Rev.Stat.  9844; 186 Wash. 589, 590, 59 P.(2d) 373, 374.\n It cannot be doubted that the power of Congress over interstate and foreign commerce embraces the authority to make regulations for respondents' tugs. Foster v. Davenport, 22 How. 244; Moran v. New Orleans, \n112 \nU.S. 69\n, 5 S.Ct. 38; Harman v. Chicago, \n147 \nU.S. 396\n, 13 S.Ct. 306. Has Congress exercised that authority and, if so, to what extent?\n The federal acts and regulations with respect to vessels on the navigable waters of the United States are elaborate. They were well described in the argument of the Assistant Solicitor General as a maze of regulation. Provisions with respect to steam vessels are extremely detailed. 46 U.S.C. c. 14,  361 et seq. (46 U.S.C.A.  361 et seq.). Provisions as to motor-driven vessels are far less comprehensive and establish only a limited regulation. By section 4426 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by the Act of March 3, 1905, c. 1457,  4, 33 Stat. 1029, 1030, and by the Act of May 16, 1906, c. 2460, 34 Stat. 193, 194 (46 U.S.C.A.  404), it was provided that all vessels 'above fifteen gross tons carrying freight or passengers for hire, but not engaged in fishing as a regular business, propelled by gas, fluid, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n naptha, or electric motors,' should be subject to the provisions of the statute relating to the inspection of hulls and boilers and requiring engineers and pilots. These vessels were also required to carry life preservers for passengers and, while carrying passengers, to be in charge of a person duly licensed by the federal local board. 46 U.S.C.  404 (46 U.S.C.A.  404). It does not appear that respondents' motor-driven tugs are within the class of vessels which carry freight or passengers for hire.\n In 1910, Congress enacted the Motor Boat Regulations Act, 36 Stat. 462 (46 U.S.C.A.  511 et seq.). While this statute is applicable to respondents' tugs, so far as it goes, its scope is restricted. Section 1 defines the word 'motor boat' as including 'every vessel propelled by machinery and not more than sixty-five feet in length except tugboats and towboats propelled by steam.' There follows in that section a proviso that the engine, boiler, or other operating machinery shall be subject to inspection by the local inspectors of steam vessels, and to the approval of the design thereof, where the vessels 'are more than forty feet in length, and which are propelled by machinery driven by steam.' Section 2 divides the motor boats which are subject to the act into three classes: ( 1) Those less than 26 feet in length; (2) those 26 feet or over and less than 40 feet in length; (3) those 40 feet or over and not more than 65 feet in length. Section 3 then provides for the carrying of lights by motor boats of the respective classes. Section 4 relates to whistles, fog horns, and bells. Sections 5 and 6 provide that motor boats subject to the act, and also motor boats more than 65 feet in length, shall carry life preservers or life belts or similar devices, and fire extinguishing equipment. Section 5 requires that all motor boats carrying passengers for hire shall be in charge of a person duly licensed by the federal local board of inspectors, and has the proviso that motor boats shall not be required to carry \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n licensed officers except as required by the Motor Boat Regulations Act. 46 U.S.C.  511-516 (46 U.S.C.A.  511-516). Under the federal regulations, motor boats are required to have on board two copies of the pilot rules to be observed by them, with copies of the departmental circular.\n As documented vessels of the United States, motor boats must be marked in a specified manner with their names and home ports. 46 U.S.C.  46 (46 U.S.C.A.  46). All vessels, regardless of tonnage, size, or manner of propulsion, and whether or not carrying freight or passengers for hire ( other than public vessels of the United States not engaged in commercial service), which have on board 'any inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk,' are to be 'considered steam vessels,' and are made subject to the provisions of the statutes relating to such vessels. This provision does not apply to inflammable or combustible liquid for use as fuel or stores. Act of June 23, 1936, c. 729, 49 Stat. 1889, 46 U.S.C.  391a (46 U.S.C.A.  391a). Vessels transporting explosives or like dangerous cargo are subject to inspection to determine that such cargo may be carried with safety, and appropriate permit for that purpose is required. Act of August 26, 1935, c. 697, 49 Stat. 868, 46 U.S.C.  178 (46 U.S.C.A.  178). 'Load lines' are established for merchant vessels of 150 gross tons or over proceeding on a 'coastwise voyage by sea,' as defined; that is, outside the line dividing inland waters from the high seas. Act of August 27, 1935, c. 747, 49 Stat. 888, 46 U.S.C.  88 (46 U.S.C.A.  88). Compare International Load Line Convention of July 5, 1930, 47 Stat. 2229. It appears from statements in the record and in argument, which we do not understand to be challenged, that there are not more than three of respondents' motor tugs, here involved, which exceed 150 tons gross.\n The limited application of the provisions of the federal laws and regulations to vessels propelled by internal-combustion engines was recently and definitely brought to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the attention of Congress. The report of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection showed that there were many large vessels of this class. \n1\n The Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives found that this situation was due to the fact 'that when the steamboat inspection laws were passed, internal-combustion-engine laws were unknown, with the result that many of the existing laws apply to steam vessels and under the opinion of the law officers of the department, do not apply to vessels operated by machinery other than by steam.' The Committee added that 'it was very doubtful whether under existing law lifeboats could be required on these motor vessels.' \n2\n To meet that situation Congress has provided that existing laws covering the inspections of steam vessels shall be applicable 'to seagoing vessels of three hundred gross tons and over propelled in whole or in part by internal-combustion engines' to such extent as may be required by the regulations of the Board of Supervising Inspectors of Steam Vessels with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce. Act of June 20, 1936, c. 628, 49 Stat. 1544, 46 U.S.C.  367 (46 U.S.C.A.  367). Even as thus limited, the act expressly excepts vessels engaged 'in fishing, oystering, clamming, crabbing, or any other branch of the fishery or kelp or sponge industry.' It is manifest that Congress carefully considered the application of existing laws and decided to what extent its field of regulation should be widened. \n3\n Congress decided to extend its regulation as to motor-driven vessels only to those of the specified class. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n We find the conclusion inescapable that, apart from the particular requirements in other respects, there is no provision of the federal laws and regulations for the inspection of the hull and machinery of respondents' motor-driven tugs in order to insure safety or determine seaworthiness, where these tugs, respectively, do not carry freight or passengers for hire, or do not have on board any inflammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk, or do not transport explosives or like dangerous cargo, or are not seagoing vessels of 300 gross tons or over, or, with respect to requirements as to load lines, are under 150 gross tons. It follows that inspection of the hull and machinery of these tugs by state authorities in order to insure safety and determine seaworthiness is not in conflict with any express provision of the federal laws and regulations. The testimony in the record shows that those laws and regulations are administered in accordance with this view. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n Second. The next question is whether the federal statutes are to be construed as implying a prohibition of inspection by state authorities of hull and machinery to insure safety and determine seaworthiness in the case of vessels which in this respect lie outside the federal requirements.\n The state court took the view that Congress had occupied the field and that no room was left for state action in relation to vessels plying on navigable waters within the control of the federal government. 186 Wash. 589, 593, 596, 59 P.(2d) 373. And this is the argument pressed by respondents and the Solicitor General.\n This argument, invoking a familiar principle, would be unnecessary and inapposite if there were a direct conflict with an express regulation of Congress acting within its province. The argument presupposes the absence of a conflict of that character. The argument is also unnecessary and inapposite if the subject is one demanding uniformity of regulation so that state action is altogether inadmissible in the absence of federal action. In that class of cases the Constitution itself occupies the field even if there is no federal legislation. The argument is appropriately addressed to those cases where States may act in the absence of federal action but where there has been federal action governing the same subject. Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617, 618; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370, 379\n, 32 S.Ct. 160; Erie Railroad Co. v. New York, \n233 \nU.S. 671, 681\n, 682 S., 34 S.Ct. 756, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 266, Ann.Cas.1915D, 138; Southern Railway Co. v.

Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 605, 612\n, 613 S., 47 S.Ct. 207, 209, 210; Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 57, 60\n, 61 S., 54 S.Ct. 573, 574\n\n\n Under our constitutional system, there necessarily remains to the states, until Congress acts, a wide range for the permissible exercise of power appropriate to their ter- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n ritorial jurisdiction although interstate commerce may be affected. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 402\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L. R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. States are thus enabled to deal with local exigencies and to exert in the absence of conflict with federal legislation an essential protective power. And when Congress does exercise its paramount authority, it is obvious that Congress may determine how far its regulation shall go. There is no constitutional rule which compels Congress to occupy the whole field. Congress may circumscribe its regulation and occupy only a limited field. When it does so, state regulation outside that limited field and otherwise admissible is not forbidden or displaced. The principle is thoroughly established that the exercise by the state of its police power, which would be valid if not superseded by federal action, is superseded only where the repugnance or conflict is so 'direct and positive' that the two acts cannot 'be reconciled or consistently stand together.'

Railroad Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 380, 392\n, 393 S., 51 S.Ct. 553, 556; Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 53 S.Ct. 611, 613; Gilvary v. Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co., supra.\n A few illustrations will suffice. In Reid v. Colorado, supra, the question arose with respect to a statute of Colorado aimed at the prevention of the introduction into the state of diseased animals. One who had been convicted of its violation contended that the subject of the transportation of cattle by one state to another had been so far covered by the federal statute, known as the Animal Industry Act (23 Stat. 31 (5 U. S.C.A.  560; 7 U.S.C.A.  391, 21 U.S.C.A.  112-115, 117-119, 130 and notes)), that no enactment by the state upon that subject was permissible. While the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n congressional act did deal with the subject of the driving or transporting of diseased livestock from one state into another, Congress had gone no further than to make it an offense against the United States for one knowingly to take or send from one state to another livestock affected with infectious or communicable disease. The court concluded that the state statute, requiring a certificate that the cattle were free from disease, irrespective of the shipper's knowledge of the actual condition of the cattle, did not cover the same ground as the act of Congress and was not inconsistent with it. Id., \n187 \nU.S. 137, 149\n, 150 S., 23 S.Ct. 92, 96. The principle was thus emphatically stated: 'It should never be held that Congress intends to supersede, or by its legislation suspend, the exercise of the police powers of the states, even when it may do so, unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested. This court has said-and the principle has been often reaffirmed-that 'in the application of this principle of supremacy of an act of Congress in a case where the state law is but the exercise of a reserved power, the repugnance or conflict should be direct and positive, so that the two acts could not be reconciled or consistently stand together.\"\n In Savage v. Jones, supra, the Court held that a statute of Indiana regulating the sale, and requiring a statement of the formula of ingredients, of concentrated commercial food for stock was not repugnant to the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 (34 Stat. 768 (21 U.S.C.A.  1- 5, 7-15 and notes)). A citizen of Minnesota sought to restrain the enforcement of the Indiana statute with respect to stock food sold and transported in interstate commerce. The federal act dealt with the subject of adulterated and misbranded foods and defined misbranding. It covered any false or misleading statements as to ingredients, but did not require a disclosure of the ingredients. The state statute dealt with that omitted matter. We found that the state requirements could be sustained without impairing the operation of the federal act as to the matters with which that act dealt. We \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n said: 'But the intent to supersede the exercise by the state of its police power as to matters not covered by the Federal legislation is not to be inferred from the mere fact that Congress has seen fit to circumscribe its regulation and to occupy a limited field. In other words, such intent is not to be implied unless the act of Congress, fairly interpreted, is in actual conflict with the law of the state.'\n In Mintz v. Baldwin, supra, the question related to the validity of the requirement of a New York statute that cattle brought into that state for dairy or breeding purposes, and also the herds from which they came, should be certified to be free from Bang's disease by the chief sanitary official of the state of origin. One of the contentions was that the statute conflicted with the federal statute known as the Cattle Contagious Disease Act of 1903. 32 Stat. 791 (21 U.S.C.A.  111, 120-122). To enable the Secretary of Agriculture to prevent the spread of disease among cattle and other livestock, he was authorized to establish regulations concerning interstate transportation from any place where he had reason to believe that diseases existed. When an inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry certified that he had inspected cattle and had found them free from communicable disease, they were permitted to be transported 'without further inspection or the exaction of fees of any kind, except such as may at any time be ordered or exacted by the Secretary of Agriculture.' But the express exclusion of state inspection extended only to cases where there had been federal inspection and a certificate issued. Accordingly, we held that it could not be extended to the case before the court where the cattle had not been inspected and certified by federal authority. We said: 'The purpose of Congress to supersede or exclude state action against the ravages of the disease is not lightly to be inferred. The intention so to do must definitely and clearly appear.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n The application of the principle is strongly fortified where the state exercises its power to protect the lives and the health of its people. But the principle is not limited to cases of that description. It extends to exertions of state power directed to more general purposes. Thus it was applied in sustaining the order of a state commission requiring interstate carriers to construct a union passenger station as against the contention that Congress had occupied the field, in view of the broad sweep of the act conferring authority upon the Interstate Commission to deal with the operation of interstate railroads, as it was found that Congress had not authorized the commission to meet the public need in the particular matter in question. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 380, 391\n, 51 S.Ct. 553, 555.\n In the instant case, in relation to the inspection of the hull and machinery of respondents' tugs, the state law touches that which the federal laws and regulations have left untouched. There is plainly no inconsistency with the federal provisions. It would hardly be asserted that when Congress set up its elaborate regulations as to steam vessels, it deprived the state of the exercise of its protective power as to vessels not propelled by steam. The fact that the federal regulations were numerous and elaborate does not extend them beyond the boundary they established. When Congress took up the regulation of vessels otherwise propelled, it applied its requirements to vessels of a described tonnage which carried freight or passengers for hire. When Congress a few years later passed the Motor Boat Regulations Act, it did not attempt to deal with the subject comprehensively, but laid down rules in a few particulars of a definitely restricted range. And when, in 1936, Congress again addressed itself to the subject, it did not purport to occupy the entire field, but confined its regulation to seagoing vessels of three hundred gross tons and over. It would be difficult to find a \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n series of statutes in which the intention of Congress to circumscribe its regulation and to occupy a field limited by definite description is more clearly manifested.\n When the state is seeking to prevent the operation of unsafe and unseaworthy vessels in going to and from its ports, it is exercising a protective power akin to that which enables the state to exclude diseased persons, animals, and plants. These are not proper subjects of commerce, and an unsafe and unseaworthy vessel is not a proper instrumentality of commerce. When the state is seeking to protect a vital interest, we have always been slow to find that the inaction of Congress has shorn the state of the power which it would otherwise possess. And we are unable to conclude that, so far as concerns the inspection of the hull and machinery of these vessels of respondents in order to insure safety and seaworthiness, the federal laws and regulations, which as we have found are not expressly applicable, carry any implied prohibition of state action.\n Much is made of the fact that the state law remained unenforced for a long period. But it did not become inoperative for that reason. Where the state police power exists, it is not lost by nonexercise but remains to be exerted as local exigencies may demand.\n Third. The remaining question is whether the state law must fall in its entirety, not because of inconsistency with federal action, but because the subject is one as to which uniformity of regulation is required, and hence, whether or not Congress has acted, the state is without authority. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319; Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 400 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18.\n The state law is a comprehensive code. While it excepts vessels which are subject to inspection under the laws of the United States, it has provisions which may be deemed to fall within the class of regulations which Congress alone can provide. For example, Congress may \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n establish standards and designs for the structure and equipment of vessels, and may prescribe rules for their operation, which could not properly be left to the diverse action of the states. The state of Washington might prescribe standards, designs, equipment, and rules of one sort, Oregon another, California another, and so on. But it does not follow that in all respects the state act must fail.\n We have found that in relation to the inspection of the hull and machinery of these tugs, in order to insure safety and seaworthiness, there is a field in which the state law could operate without coming into conflict with present federal laws. Is that a subject which necessarily and in all aspects requires uniformity of regulation and as to which the state cannot act at all, although Congress has not acted? We hold that it is not. A vessel which is actually unsafe and unseaworthy in the primary and commonly understood sense is not within the protection of that principle. The state may treat it as it may treat a diseased animal or unwholesome food. In such a matter, the state may protect its people without waiting for federal action providing the state action does not come into conflict with federal rules. If, however, the state goes further and attempts to impose particular standards as to structure, design, equipment, and operation, which in the judgment of its authorities may be desirable, but pass beyond what is plainly essential to safety and seaworthiness, the state will encounter the principle that such requirements, if imposed at all, must be through the action of Congress which can establish a uniform rule. Whether the state in a particular matter goes too far must be left to be determined when the precise question arises.\n We have mentioned the inspection of hull and machinery of respondents' vessels in order to insure safety and seaworthiness. There may be other requirements of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n state act which also lie outside the bounds of the federal action thus far taken and as to which uniformity of regulation is not needed. That question cannot be satisfactorily determined on this record and must also remain for decision as it may be presented in the future in connection with some particular action taken by the state authorities. Our conclusion is that the state act has a permissible field of operation in relation to respondents' tugs, and that the state court was in error in holding the act completely unenforceable in deference to federal law. The judgment of the state court to that effect is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Report (June 25, 1935) of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives on 'Inspection of Motor Vessels.' H.R.Rep.No.1321, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. Reference was made to the situation as described by the Assistant Director of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection as follows:\n'We have at the present time vessels that are operated by internal- combustion engines, of tonnages exceeding 100, there are 772 vessels of 819,935 gross tons that would come under the provision of this law (the proposed bill).\n\n'For instance, we have in the class from 5,000 to 7,500 tons 29 vessels, with a total tonnage of 179,556; and over 7,500 tons we have 33 vessels, with a total tonnage of 300,292.\n\n'Those large vessels at the present time are subject to only a very limited inspection-that is, the inspection of the hulls and boilers, and are required under the law to carry a licensed engineer and a licensed pilot. The provisions of section 4472 (46 U.S.C.A.  465) that provides for protection against fire do not apply to our 7,500-ton vessels that are in the trans-Atlantic trade. They are not required under the law to carry a single lifeboat. There are many other provisions of the steamboat inspection laws that are of the utmost importance to safety of life that do not apply to these large transoceanic vessels. As a matter of fact, we are inspecting those vessels at the present time, but it is only because the owners of the ships accept such inspection. It is not a matter of law.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] H.R.Rep.No.2505, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id. \n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKELLY V. UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 309\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n [ Kelly v. United States   \n300 \nU.S. 50\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 50\n, 51]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. W. B. Stratton, of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n  Messrs. Stanley F. Reed, Sol. Gen., of Washington D.C., Robert H. Jackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Sewall Key, J. Louis Monarch, and Helen R. Carloss, all of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In a proceeding begun January 9, 1934, the District Court, Western District of Washington, adjudged the Carlisle Packing Company bankrupt, February 9, 1934. The United States presented their claim for income taxes for 1927, 1928, and 1929, and the trustee filed objections, June 18, 1934. He asserted that the Company received no taxable income during 1927 but suffered loss sufficient to offset any gains for 1928 and 1929. The referee received copy of the duly authenticated judgment by the Board of Tax Appeals, which sustained the tax in question, took other evidence, and upon the whole record concluded that the Company lost as averred during 1927. He disallowed the claim and explained this action by an opinion.\n  Exceptions challenged the referee's refusal to treat the decision of the Tax Board as conclusive and hold the bankruptcy court lacked power to consider the merits of the assessments. A petition for review by the District Court alleged finality of the Board's judgment, lack of power in the bankruptcy court, and asked disallowance of the claim.\n  From an abstract of the proceedings returned by the referee it appears-\n  That the United States had unsuccessfully objected to the introduction of any testimony concerning the merits of the questioned tax upon the ground that the Board's \n\n[300 \nU.S. 50\n, 52]\n\u00a0\n judgment in respect of the same matter had become final and conclusive.\n  That the bankrupt had borrowed large sums from the Bank of California, and in 1927, when unable otherwise to meet its obligations, had transferred to the Bank much property and received therefor its own canceled notes for $650,000. The Company claimed no profit arose from this transaction and that it sustained large losses during 1927. The collector ruled to the contrary and assessed delinquencies for three years. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained him, approved the assessments, and adjudged accordingly, January 4, 1934. On January 12, 1934, he made summary assessments. The time for contesting the Board's judgment had not expired when petitioner was adjudged bankrupt.\n  Upon motion of the United States the District Court directed that the bankrupt's tax returns be made parts of the record. It then heard the cause, considered whether the decision of the Board was conclusive, and held: 'To reach the conclusion that a deficiency determined by the Board of Tax Appeals may be re-examined and re-decided by the Judge of a District Court or a Referee in Bankruptcy is, on its face, inconsistent with the intent and purpose on the part of Congress shown that a review of the Board's decision should be by such an appellate court.' Accordingly it rendered an opinion, disaffirmed the referee's action, and allowed the claim.\n  Thereupon the trustee appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Among other things he assigned as error the ruling that the bankruptcy court lacked power to determine anew questions which the Board of Tax Appeals had adjudicated. Portions of the record in the District Court, certified as correct by the clerk, were filed. Counsel for the United States obtained leave to make part of the transcript the District Court's opinion. This was \n\n[300 \nU.S. 50\n, 53]\n\u00a0\n omitted, he said, through inadvertence only recently discovered.\n  It is asserted and not denied that the cause was heard by the Court without objection to the record, and that both sides treated the statement of the evidence as correct. Undoubtedly, the record was not properly authenticated within the requirements of Equity Rules 75(b)1 and 77.2\n  Upon its own motion the Circuit Court of Appeals raised the point and decided 'appellant has not com- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 50\n, 54]\n\u00a0\n plied with either of these rules, but has disregarded them both. There is no statement of the evidence, nor is there any agreed statement of the case. In the absence of any such statement, we indulge the presumption that the evidence supports the judgment and warrants its affirmance.'\n  The trustee asked for a rehearing, also that the record be returned to the District Court for settlement and proper authentication. Both things were denied. One of the judges dissented, and from his unquestioned statement it appears: 'Neither party raised the point on which the opinion was based. The point took its origin from the bench without suggestion from or reference to either party and in the face of extended argument and voluminous briefs based upon the statement of evidence contained in the abstract.' He thought the petition for rehearing should have been granted and opportunity afforded to secure proper authentication of the record.\n  Manifestly the equity rules should be enforced with the strictness necessary to effectuate their essential purpose; orderly procedure so demands. But when, as here, there is mere omission of some step which has escaped the attention of both parties, and when rigorous enforcement without fair opportunity to correct the error would defeat hearing on the merits and entail unnecessary hardship, we think appropriate relief promptly asked for \n\n[300 \nU.S. 50\n, 55]\n\u00a0\n should be afforded. Permission to supply authentication of the record would have occasioned no material injury to any party, nor interfered seriously with the business of the Court. In the circumstances we must regard the denial of an opportunity to amend as an abuse of discretion-a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the rules.\n  The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The cause will be remanded there for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equity Rule 75(b), as amended, \n286 \nU.S. 570, 28\n U.S.C.A. following section 723:\n'The evidence to be included in the record, except expert testimony, shall not be set forth in full, but shall be stated in simple and condensed form, all parts not essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal being omitted and the testimony of witnesses being stated only in narrative form, save that if either party desires it, and the court or judge so directs, any part of the testimony shall be reproduced in the exact words of the witness.

ILLINOIS CENT. R. CO.(1937)\nNo. 138\nArgued: November 20, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 334, 335]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles I. Dawson, of Louisville, Ky., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Blakey Helm, of Louisville, Ky., for respondent.\n Mr. John Dickinson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for U.S., as amicus curiae.\n\n\n[299 U.S. 334, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This controversy relates to the constitutional validity of the Act of Congress of July 24, 1935, known as the Ashurst-Sumners Act (sections 1-4), 49 Stat. 494 (49 U.S.C.A.  61-64).\n The act makes it unlawful knowingly to transport in interstate or foreign commerce goods made by convict labor into any state where the goods are intended to be received, possessed, sold, or used in violation of its laws. Goods made by convicts on parole or probation, or made in federal penal and correctional institutions for use by the federal government, are excepted. Packages containing convict-made goods must be plainly labeled so as to show the names and addresses of shipper and consignee, the nature of the contents, and the name and \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 344]\n\u00a0\n location of the penal or reformatory institution where produced. \n1\n Violation is punished by fine and forfeiture. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner manufactures in Kentucky, with convict labor, horse collars, harness, and strap goods which it markets in various states. It tendered to respondent, a common carrier, twenty-five separate shipments for transportation in interstate commerce, of which ten were consigned to customers in states whose laws prohibited the \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 345]\n\u00a0\n sale of convict-made goods within their respective borders, five to states whose laws did not prohibit such sale, but required that the goods should be plainly marked so as to show that they were made by convicts, and the remaining ten to states whose laws imposed no restriction upon sale or possession. None of the packages were labeled as required by the Act of Congress and, in obedience to the act, respondent refused to accept the shipments.\n Petitioner then brought this suit for a mandatory injunction to compel the transportation. The District Court dismissed the bill and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. The District Court declared the act to be invalid so far as it prohibited transportation of convict- made goods into states which proscribed sale or possession, but sustained the provision which required labeling. 12 F.Supp. 37. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the act in its entirety. 84 F.(2d) 168. This Court granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 525\n, 57 S.Ct. 19, 81 L.Ed. --. October 12, 1936\n\n\n Petitioner contends (1) that the Congress is without constitutional authority to prohibit the movement in interstate commerce of useful and harmless articles made by convict labor and (2) that the Congress has no power to exclude from interstate commerce convict-made goods which are not labeled as such.\n First. The commerce clause (article 1,  8, cl. 3) confers upon the Congress 'the power to regulate, that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.' This power 'is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. By the act now before us, the Congress purports to establish a rule governing interstate transportation, which is unquestionably interstate commerce. The question is whether this rule goes beyond the authority to 'regulate.' \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 346]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner's argument necessarily recognizes that in certain circumstances an absolute prohibition of interstate transportation is constitutional regulation. The power to prohibit interstate transportation has been upheld by this Court in relation to diseased live stock,3 lottery tickets,4 commodities owned by the interstate carrier transporting them, except such as may be required in the conduct of its business as a common carrier,5 adulterated and misbranded articles, under the Pure Food and Drugs Act,6 women, for immoral purposes,7 intoxicating liquors,8 diseased plants, 9 stolen motor vehicles,10 and kidnaped persons. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The decisions sustaining this variety of statutes disclose the principles deemed to be applicable. We have frequently said that in the exercise of its control over interstate commerce, the means employed by the Con- \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 347]\n\u00a0\n gress may have the quality of police regulations. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 215\n, 5 S.Ct. 826; Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 323\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 906, Ann.Cas.1913E, 905; Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 515\n, 36 S. Ct. 190, L.R.A.1916D, 164. The power was defined in broad terms in Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432, 436\n, 437 S., 45 S.Ct. 345, 346, 37 A.L.R. 1407: 'Congress can certainly regulate interstate commerce to the extent of forbidding and punishing the use of such commerce as an agency to promote immorality, dishonesty or the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other states from the state of origin. In doing this it is merely exercising the police power, for the benefit of the public, within the field of interstate commerce.'\n The anticipated evil or harm may proceed from something inherent in the subject of transportation as in the case of diseased or noxious articles, which are unfit for commerce. Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45\n, 31 S.Ct. 364; Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87, 99\n, 46 S.Ct. 279, 282. Or the evil may lie in the purpose of the transportation, as in the case of lottery tickets, or the transportation of women for immoral purposes. Champion v. Ames, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 358\n, 23 S.Ct. 321; Hoke v. United States, supra; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 486\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, L.R.A.1917F, 502, Ann.Cas.1917B, 1168. The prohibition may be designed to give effect to the policies of the Congress in relation to the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as in the case of commodities owned by interstate carriers. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 415\n, 29 S.Ct. 527. And, while the power to regulate interstate commerce resides in the Congress, which must determine its own policy, the Congress may shape that policy in the light of the fact that the transportation in interstate commerce, if permitted, would aid in the frustration of valid state laws for the protection of persons and property. Brooks v. United States, supra; Gooch v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 124\n, 56 S.Ct. 395.\n The contention is inadmissible that the Act of Congress is invalid merely because the horse collars and harness \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 348]\n\u00a0\n which petitioner manufactures and sells are useful and harmless articles. The motor vehicles, which are the subject of the transportation prohibited in the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act12 are in themselves useful and proper subjects of commerce, but their transportation by one who knows they have been stolen is 'a gross misuse of interstate commerce' and the Congress may properly punish it 'because of its harmful result and its defeat of the property rights of those whose machines against their will are taken into other jurisdictions.' Brooks v. United States, supra, \n267 U.S. 432\n, at page 439, 45 S.Ct. 345, 346, 37 A.L.R. 1407. Similarly, the object of the Federal Kidnaping Act13 is to aid in the protection of the personal liberty of one who has been unlawfully seized or carried away. Gooch v. United States, supra; compare United States v. Wheeler, \n254 \nU.S. 281\n, 41 S.Ct. 133.\n On the same general principle, the Congress may prevent interstate transportation from being used to bring into a state articles the traffic in which the state has constitutional authority to forbid, and has forbidden, in its internal commerce. In that view, we sustained the acts of Congress designed to prevent the use of interstate transportation to hamper the execution of state policy with respect to traffic in intoxicating liquors. This was not because intoxicating liquors were not otherwise legitimate articles of commerce. On the contrary, they were recognized as such 'by the usages of the commercial world, the laws of congress, and the decisions of courts.' Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100, 110\n, 10 S.Ct. 681, 684; In re Rahrer, \n140 \nU.S. 545, 556\n, 11 S.Ct. 865; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. F. W. Cook Brewing Co., \n223 \nU.S. 70, 82\n, 32 S.Ct. 189. It was because intoxicating liquors were legitimate subjects of commercial intercourse that the states were powerless to interfere with their transportation in interstate commerce. Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465, 489\n, 8 S. Ct. 1062; Leisy v. Hardin, \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 349]\n\u00a0\n supra, \n135 U.S. 100\n, at pages 110, 113, 10 S.Ct. 681; Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 \nU.S. 412\n, 18 S.Ct. 664; Vance a. W. A. Vandercook Co. (No. 1), \n170 \nU.S. 438\n, 18 S.Ct. 674; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. F. W. Cook Brewing Co., supra. But because of the effects ascribed to the traffic in intoxicating liquors, the states in the exercise of their police power in relation to their internal commerce could restrict or interdict that traffic without violating the Federal Constitution. Foster v. Kansas, \n112 \nU.S. 201, 206\n, 5 S.Ct. 8; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 U.S. 623\n, 657-659, 8 S.Ct. 273. To aid the states in securing the full protection they desired, Congress brought into play its power to regulate interstate commerce.\n By the Wilson Act of August 8, 1890,14 intoxicating liquors transported into any state were subjected upon arrival to the operation of state laws to the same extent as though they had been produced within the state, although still in the original packages. This act was upheld in Re Rahrer, supra. But the statute did not apply until the transportation was completed by actual delivery to the consignee. Rhodes v. Iowa, supra, \n170 U.S. 412\n, at page 426, 18 S.Ct. 664; Adams Express Co. v. Kentucky, \n214 \nU.S. 218, 222\n, 29 S.Ct. 633; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. F. W. Cook Brewing Co., supra. As 'the right to receive' was not affected by the Wilson Act, 'such receipt and the possession following from it and the resulting right to use' remained protected by the commerce clause. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 323\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, 184, L.R.A.1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845. In this situation the Congress passed the Webb- Kenyon Act of March 1, 1913,15 which prohibited the transportation of intoxicating liquors into any state when it was intended that they should be 'received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used,' in violation of its laws. The Court upheld the constitutional validity of this act as a regulation of interstate commerce. Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., supra. It was \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 350]\n\u00a0\n supplemented by the Act of March 3, 1917, known as the Reed Amendment. 16 United States v. Hill, \n248 \nU.S. 420, 424\n, 39 S.Ct. 143.\n The ruling in Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724, upon which petitioner relies, in no way contravenes or limits the principle of these decisions. In the Hammer Case, the Court concluded that the Act of Congress there under consideration had as its aim the placing of local production under federal control. Id., \n247 U.S. 251\n, at pages 271, 272, 38 S.Ct. 529, 531, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724. Far from disapproving the decisions we have cited, the Court expressly recognized their authority 'In each of these instances,' the Court said, 'the use of interstate transportation was necessary to the accomplishment of harmful results. In other words, although the power over interstate transportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of interstate commerce to effect the evil intended.' Id. And within a few months after the Hammer Case, the Court in United States v. Hill, supra, emphatically reiterated the doctrine of these cases and, in particular, that of Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., sustaining the Webb-Kenyon Act.\n The course of congressional legislation with respect to convict-made goods has followed closely the precedents as to intoxicating liquors. By the Hawes-Cooper Act of January 19, 1929,17 the Congress provided that convict-made goods (with certain exceptions) transported into any state should be subject upon arrival, whether in the original packages or otherwise, to the operation of state laws as if produced within the state. In Whitfield v. Ohio, \n297 \nU.S. 431\n, 56 S.Ct. 532, 533, petitioner was charged in the state court in Ohio with selling convict- made goods in violation of the state law. It appeared that the goods had been sold in the original packages as shipped in interstate com- \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 351]\n\u00a0\n merce and that there was 'nothing harmful, injurious, or deleterious' about them. But this Court said that the view of the state of Ohio, that the sale of convict-made goods in competition with the products of free labor was an evil, found ample support in fact and in the similar legislation of a preponderant number of other states. The Court observed that the Congress had prohibited the importation of the products of convict labor. 18 All such legislation, state and federal, proceeded upon the view 'that free labor, properly compensated, cannot compete successfully with the enforced and unpaid or underpaid convict labor of the prison.' The Court upheld the power of the state, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, to base nondiscriminatory legislation upon that conception, and as it appeared that the Ohio statute would be unassailable if made to take effect after sale in the original package, the statute was held to be equally unassailable in the light of the provisions of the Hawes-Cooper Act. As to the validity of the latter act, the Court followed the decision in In re Rahrer, supra, in relation to the Wilson Act.\n The Ashurst-Sumners Act as to interstate transportation of convict- made goods has substantially the same provisions as the Webb-Kenyon Act as to intoxicating liquors and finds support in similar considerations. The subject of the prohibited traffic is different, the effects of the traffic are different, but the underlying principle is the same. The pertinent point is that where the subject of commerce is one as to which the power of the state may constitutionally be exerted by restriction or prohibition in order to prevent harmful consequences, the Congress may, if it sees fit, put forth its power to regulate interstate commerce so as to prevent that commerce from being used to impede the carrying out of the state policy. \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 352]\n\u00a0\n In the congressional action there is nothing arbitrary or capricious bringing the statute into collision with the requirements of due process of law. The Congress in exercising the power confided to it by the Constitution is as free as the states to recognize the fundamental interests of free labor. \n19\n Nor has the Congress attempted to delegate its authority to the states. The Congress has not sought to exercise a power not granted or to usurp the police powers of the states. It has not acted on any assumption of a power enlarged by virtue of state action. The Congress has exercised its plenary power which is subject to no limitation other than that which is found in the Constitution itself. The Congress has formulated its own policy and established its own rule. The fact that it has adopted its rule in order to aid the enforcement of valid state laws affords no ground for constitutional objection.\n Second. As the Congress could prohibit the interstate transportation of convict-made goods as provided in section 1 of the act, the Congress could require packages \n\n[299 U.S. 334, 353]\n\u00a0\n containing convict-made goods to be labeled as required by section 2. The requirement of labels, disclosing the nature of the contents, the name and location of the penal institution where the goods were produced, and the names and addresses of shippers and consignees, was manifestly reasonable and appropriate for the carrying out of the prohibition. Seven Cases v. United States, supra; United States v. Freeman, \n239 \nU.S. 117\n, 36 S.Ct. 32; Weeks v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 618, 622\n, 38 S.Ct. 219. The fact that the labeling was required in all shipments of convict-made goods, regardless of the law of the state of destination, does not invalidate the provision as its scope could reasonably be deemed to be necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose of the Act Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 609\n, 23 S.Ct. 168; New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 40\n, 29 S.Ct. 10; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v.

Rep. No. 906, 74th Cong., 1st sess.):\n'For many years the Congress has considered bills relating to the sale of prison-made goods. Extensive hearings have been held on these measures which have thoroughly revealed the evils attending the sale of such goods, in the open market, in competition with goods manufactured and produced by free labor. These evils impelled the Congress in 1929 to enact the Hawes-Cooper law, by virtue of which prison-made goods, upon their entry and delivery into a State, became subject to the laws of that State.\n\n'At present 21 States, with a population in excess of 75 millions, have enacted laws prohibiting the sale, in the open market, of prison-made goods. This bill is designed to prohibit the transportation of such goods into the States which have thus legislated, in cases in which such goods are to be received or used in violation of the State law. The principle involved in this bill has been frequently sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNOX NAT. FARM LOAN ASS'N V. PHILLIPS(1937)\nNo. 389\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n  Messrs. Peyton R. Evans, of Washington, D.C., and Gerald E. Lyons, of Cresco, Iowa, for petitioners.\n  Mr. Wm. E. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. [ Knox Nat. Farm Loan Ass'n v. Phillips   \n300 \nU.S. 194\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The controversy in this case makes it necessary to determine the remedies available to a shareholder in an insolvent farm loan association upon the refusal of a demand for the retirement of his shares.\n  Respondent is the owner of a farm in Knox county, Ohio. His vendors were members of the Knox National Farm Loan Association, a co-operative membership corporation chartered under federal law. Federal Farm Loan Act, July 17, 1916, c. 245,  7, 39 Stat. 365, 12 \nU.S.C.  711 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  711). Through that association they procured a loan from the Federal Land Bank of Louisville, giving a mortgage as security. Part of the proceeds of the loan (i.e., 5 per cent. thereof) they used for the purchase of stock in the co-operative association, there being a requirement of the statute that 'any person desiring to borrow on farm land mortgage through a national farm loan association shall make application for membership and shall subscribe for shares of stock in such farm loan association to an amount equal to 5 per centum of the face of the desired loan, said subscription to be paid in cash upon the granting of the loan.' Federal Farm Loan Act,  8, 12 \nU.S.C.  733 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  733); cf.  9, 12 \nU.S.C. 745 (12 \nU.S.C.A.  745). The statutory plan has already been expounded in opinions of this court. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 203\n, 246; Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, \n290 \nU.S. 247\n; Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, \n295 \nU.S. 229\n.\n  Upon the purchase of the farm by respondent in October, 1927, he assumed the payment of the mortgage debt, succeeding at the same time to the interests of his vendors in the stock of the association and to the attendant liabilities. The shares were of the par value of $265. They had been pledged with the association, in accordance with the requirements of the statute (section 8, 12 U.S.C.  733 (12 U.S.C.A.  733)) as security for the loan. The association on its part had subscribed for an equal amount of the shares of the federal land bank, the lender of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 196]\n\u00a0\n money, leaving the shares so subscribed for as a pledge for the security of the lender. This too was a procedure called for by the statute. Section 7, 12 U.S.C.  721 (12 U.S.C.A.  721). From time to time thereafter there were payments on account, with the result that the loan had been reduced by March, 1933, to $2,122.46, at which time respondent made an effort to clear the farm of the mortgage and to put an end also to his liability as shareholder. To that end he paid the association $1,857.46 to be transmitted to the bank, insisting that the deficiency ($265) be satisfied through the retirement of the shares. The bank accepted the payment as one upon account, but refused to discharge the mortgage without payment of the balance. At that time, by concession, the association was insolvent. Its capital was impaired; it was indebted to the bank upon other mortgage loans, being liable as indorser or otherwise when it borrows for a member ( Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, supra); it had no moneys in its treasury wherewith the shares could be retired.\n  The courts took up the controversy. Respondent joined the bank and the association as defendants in a suit in the court of common pleas of Knox county, Ohio. He prayed for judgment against the bank that the mortgage be held to have been canceled and extinguished and for judgment against the association that the shares of stock be paid off and retired, and that the business of the association be wound up and liquidated. For answer, the bank and the association took the ground that the partial payment made was insufficient to discharge the mortgage; that there could be no retirement of the shares while the association was insolvent; that the state court was without jurisdiction to liquidate the business of the association, an instrumentality of the federal government; and that jurisdiction in that behalf resided in the federal government exclusively.\n  Two decrees were rendered by the court of common pleas. The first, filed October 7, 1935, provides that the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 197]\n\u00a0\n mortgage lien shall be canceled by the bank upon tender by the plaintiff of $265 in addition to the payment previously made, the tender to be kept good by payment into court. The second, filed November 18, 1935, directs the farm loan association to retire the respondent's shares, and gives him judgment against the association for the par value thereof. It appearing that the association was unable to pay the judgment by reason of insolvency, a receiver was appointed to take possession of the assets and liquidate the business, the association of its officers being required forthwith, upon the demand of the receiver, to surrender any property in their possession or under their control. From the decree of November 18, the defendants prosecuted an appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals,** which affirmed with an opinion. A petition for review by the Supreme Court of the state was submitted and denied. We granted certiorari (\n299 \nU.S. 533\n) to set at rest far-reaching questions as to the meaning and administration of an important act of Congress.\n  At the outset a doubt as to our jurisdiction calls for scrutiny and judgment. The case being here after a decision of a state court, jurisdiction is not given us unless the decree to be reviewed is final. Judicial Code  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344). Respondent has been adjudged entitled to the payment of a specific sum of money, but he is also to have a receiver who is to liquidate a business, the court reserving the right to control the conduct of its officer and to rescind or modify its order. Does the appointment of a receiver postpone the stage of finality until his work is at an end?\n  The primary purpose of the suit was the recovery of a judgment for the par value of the shares. Any other relief prayed for or awarded was tributary to that recovery; it was a form of equitable execution to make collection possible. When the amount invested in the stock was adjudged to constitute a debt, whatever folloed in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 198]\n\u00a0\n the decree was auxiliary and modal. The association and its officers were not directed to account, and to surrender what was found owing at the close of the accounting. They were directed to make delivery and to make delivery at once. We think they were subjected to a present obligation as immediate and absolute as if the assets were to be wrested from them by execution directed to the sheriff. Winthrop Iron Co. v. Meeker, \n109 \nU.S. 180, 183\n; St. Louis, I.M. & S.R. Co. v. Southern Express Co., \n108 \nU.S. 24, 28\n, 29; Thomson v. Dean, 7 Wall. 342; McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio Central Ry.

(C.C.A.) 230 F. 570, 573; Victor Talking Machine Co. v. George (C.C.A.) 69 F.(2d) 871, 879.\n  Accepting jurisdiction, we are brought to a consideration of the merits.\n  A national farm loan association is a co-operative enterprise. Its members must subscribe for its shares to the extent of 5 per cent. of the loan to be procured in their behalf. Federal Farm Loan Act,  8, 12 U.S.C .  733 (12 U.S.C.A.  733). The association in its turn, upon the procurement of the loan, subscribes to stock of the land bank to an equivalent extent. Section 7, 12 U.S.C.  721 (12 U.S.C.A.  721). With few exceptions, the only assets which a farm loan association has or can have are the shares which it takes in the federal land bank to counter- balance the shares of its own stock taken by he borrower, together with dividends distributed by the bank, and reasonable charges for necessary expenses, not in excess of '1 per centum of the amount of the loan applied for.' Byrne v. Federal Land Bank, 61 N.D. 265, 277, 237 N.W. 797, 802; cf .  11 as amended 12 U.S.C.  761, subd. 3 (12 U.S.C.A.  761 subd. 3). To add to the protection of the bank and other creditors, the shareholders in the association are chargeable under the law as it stood at the date of these transactions with personal liability up to a designated maximum. 'Shareholders of every national farm loan association shall be held individually \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 199]\n\u00a0\n responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.' Section 9, 12 U.S.C.  744 (12 U.S.C.A.  744).1 Upon evidence that an association has failed to meet its obligations the Farm Credit Administration may declare it insolvent and appoint a receiver, subject to the proviso that this shall not be done until the total defaults shall amount to at least $150,000 in the federal land bank district, unless such association shall have been in default for a period of two years. Section 29, 12 U.S.C.  961 (12 U.S.C.A .  961). There shall be no voluntary liquidation without the consent of the supervising federal authority. Section 29, 12 U.S.C.  965 (12 U.S.C.A .  965.\n  The background has now been indicated against which we must view the question whether a member of an association who has paid his loan in full may have his shares retired and recover their par value when the association is insolvent. In support of such a recovery respondent relies upon two sections of the statute. By section 7 (12 U.S.C.  721 (12 U.S.C. A.  721)) an association borrowing from a land bank 'shall subscribe for capital stock of said land bank to the amount of 5 per centum of such loan,' the stock to be held by the bank as collateral security. By the same section, such stock (i.e., the stock of the land bank) shall be 'paid off and retired upon full payment of the mortgage loan.' If that is done, 'the national farm loan association shall pay off at par and retire the corresponding shares of its stock which were issued when said land bank stock was issued.'2 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 200]\n\u00a0\n Complimentary to that section is section 8 of the Act (12 U.S.C.  733 (12 U.S.C.A.  733)), which regulates the relation between the association and its members. Upon applying for a loan, the applicant 'shall subscribe for shares of stock in such farm loan association to an amount equal to 5 per centum of the face of the desired loan,' the subscription at his election to be paid out of the proceeds, and the stock to be held by the association as collateral security. 'Said capital stock shall be paid off at par and retired upon full payment of said loan.' Id.\n  These provisions for retirement, despite their apparent breadth, are not to be extended to a situation such as the one before us here, and this for two reasons.\n  In the first place, section 8 of the statute, as already pointed out, is complementary to section 7. We are to read the two together. The association is not to retire its own shares and repay to the subscriber the amount of his subscription until the land bank has retired the corresponding shares of bank stock subscribed for by the association, and has paid back to the association the par value thereof. Only thus can the association be put in funds wherewith to make payment to its own subscribers. The record makes it plain, however, that this indispensable condition has never been fulfilled. The bank refuses to retire the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 201]\n\u00a0\n shares of bank stock subscribed for by the association upon the loan to the respondent, or to refund the subscriptions wholly or in part. The scheme of the statute would be fatally disrupted if the association could be held when the bank refused to pay.\n  In the second place, neither the bank nor the association is under a duty to retire stock when the association is insolvent, and thus to give to the withdrawing member through the return of his subscription a preference over others. The statute is misread if the sentences regulating withdrawal are taken out of the setting of a co-operative scheme and viewed in isolation. Under the law as it stood when respondent became a member, the shareholders were subjected to a personal liability for all the contracts, debts, and engagements of the association 'to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.' Section 9, 12 U.S.C.  744 (12 U.S.C.A.  744). The association is already in default in the payment of its mortgage debts, and already its capital is impaired. In such circumstances, to return to respondent the amount paid in and represented by his shares would frustrate the statutory mandate that the amount so paid in shall constitute a fund for the benefit of creditors to be supplemented in case of need by personal liability for as much more as the investment. Indeed, altogether apart from any pledge of personal liability, the whole structure of the association is built upon the implication of equal rights and duties on the part of the co-operating members. To permit a member to withdraw when the association is insolvent would be to cast upon his fellow members the responsibility for defaults for which all should answer ratably in proportion to their interests. To guard against that inequity the statute makes it clear that shares in the association shall not be subject to retirement until the corresponding subscriptions to the land bank have been \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 202]\n\u00a0\n canceled and refunded. We are not required to determine whether a member of an association will have rights enforceable against the bank when the association has been wound up in accordance with the federal statute. Cf. section 29, as added by Act March 4, 1923, 12 U.S.C.  966 (12 U.S.C.A.  966). No such question is before us. Enough for present purposes that in the existing situation, with insolvency conceded, the shares of the association are not subject to withdrawal.\n  The conclusion thus arrived at is in accord with well-considered opinions in North Dakota and Arkansas where the same question was involved. Byrne v. Federal Land Bank, supra; Western Clay National Farm Loan Ass'n v. Lilly, 189 Ark. 1004, 76 S.W.(2d) 55, 95 A.L.R. 1506. It has the support of persuasive analogies in the law of building and loan associations, which have much in common with farm loan associations incorporated by act of Congress. The settled rule is that the shares of building and loan associations are not subject to retirement when the association is insolvent, and that any refund made at such a time may be reclaimed by a receiver. Towle v. American Bldg., Loan & Inv. Society (C.C.) 61 F. 446; Sullivan v. Stucky (C.C.) 86 F. 491, 943; Coltrane v. Balke (C.C.A.) 113 F. 785; Aldrich v.

Burnet, 62 App.D.C. 131, 65 F.(2d) 477, 479, 481.\n  In holding that a judgment for the par value of the shares is inconsistent with the federal statute and impliedly forbidden, we cut the ground away from the auxiliary receivership, which must fall with the judgment it was intended to enforce. To this we add, however, that a national farm loan association is an instrumentality of the federal government; that the time and manner of liquidation are governed by the federal statute; and that jurisdiction does not reside in the tribunals of a state to wind up the business of this governmental agency \n\n[300 \nU.S. 194\n, 203]\n\u00a0\n either by a receivership or otherwise.

IRVING TRUST CO.(1937)\nNo. 354\nArgued: December 15, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 445, 446]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rollin Browne and Henry L. Glenn, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. D. Whitney, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are concerned with that portion of subsection (b)(10) of section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10), which limits the claim of a landlord for indemnity under a covenant in a lease to an amount not to exceed three years' rent.\n The questions are: (1) Is the claim so limited in all events and for all purposes or is the surplus over the specified amount, though subordinated to the claims of other creditors, to have priority over the interests of stockholders or to be reserved as a liability of the reorganized corporation? (2) If the claim is limited in all events to the named amount, is the provision obnoxious to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution?\n The petitioners leased real estate to United Cigar Stores Company in 1926 for a term expiring in 1946. August 29, 1932, the company was adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt. November 14, 1932, the trustee rejected the lease and abandoned the premises. The following day the petitioners reentered and terminated the leasehold in accordance with the provisions of the lease which contained a covenant by the lessee to indemnify them against all loss of rent from such termination. Immediately upon adoption of section 77B the bankrupt filed its petition for reorganization thereunder, which was approved by the court.\n The petitioners presented a proof of claim, measuring the injury resulting from the termination of the leasehold by the difference between the rental value and the value of the rent reserved for the remainder of the term. They prayed that the amount claimed be ranked on a parity with other provable debts to the extent of three years' rent and, as to the balance, be subordinated to other provable debts but awarded priority over the claims or inter- \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n ests of the debtor's stockholders. The trustee asked that the allowance be in an amount limited as provided by the statute. Committees representing preferred stockholders and debenture holders objected to allowance of the claim in any amount, asserting the petitioners could not sue on the covenant of indemnity under the state law until the expiration of the term and, having no presently enforceable claim under state law, had none in the reorganization proceeding. The petitioners amended their pleading by adding a prayer that to the extent any portion of the claim might be held not allowable a charge be reserved against the debtor's assets for such portion in priority to any interest accorded stockholders.\n The uncontroverted testimony is that the fair rental value for the balance of the term is $111,545,36. The future installments of rent to the end of the term agregate $199,237.66. A special master recommended that the petitioners' claim be allowed and liquidated at the amount of the difference between present rental value and present value of the rent reserved. He found that the sum so ascertained would be not less than the equivalent of three years' rent and recommended allowance of the claim on a parity with provable debts to the extent of three years' rent-$44,377.55- and the reservation of all questions as to the balance until the time for classification of creditors and consideration of a reorganization plan. The District Court confirmed the master's report save that it decided the claim as allowed should represent the extent of claimants' right to participate in the proceedings. Cross-appeals were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals which held that petitioners had a provable claim, that the method adopted for the liquidation of the claim was proper, that section 77B required limitation of allowance to a sum not in excess of the three years' rent mentioned in the statute and that such limitation does not take petitioners' property without due process of law \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \n1\n We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions involved.\n The respondent stockholders' committee does not now deny that the petitioners have a provable claim but joins the trustee in support of the decision below that the allowance must be limited for all purposes of the proceeding to three years' rent.\n We have held in City Bank Farmers Trust Company v. Irving Trust Company2 that the broad definition of creditors in section 77B gives the petitioners a provable claim for breach of the debtor's covenant of indemnity. The section, however, limits the amount for which such a claim may be allowed. The relevant provision, so far as applicable to petitioners' claim is: 'The claim of a landlord ... for ... indemnity under a covenant contained in such lease shall be treated as a claim ranking on a parity with debts which would be provable under section 63(a) of this Act (section 103(a) of this title), but shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the rent, without acceleration, reserved by said lease for the three years next succeeding ... the date of reentry of the landlord.' 11 U.S.C.A.  207(b)(10).\n The legislative history of this provision, and the successive alterations of its wording in both Houses of Congress and in conference, to which we are referred, cannot affect its interpretation, since the language of the act as adopted is clear. The only phrase to which petitioners point in support of their contention that the claim is to be divided into two parts, one for an amount not exceeding three years' rent, to stand on a parity with other provable claims, and the other, representing the balance, to be subordinated to creditors' claims, but preferred to the interest of stockholders, is: 'shall be treated as a claim \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n ranking on a parity with debts which would be provable under section 63(a) ( section 103(a)).' We need not consider the suggestion that the words 'on a parity' were left in the clause per incuriam when formulation of an earlier draft was altered, since, in our opinion, their presence however they came to be inserted, cannot overcome the direct mandate that 'the claim ... shall be limited.' We agree, threrfore, with the Circuit Court of Appeals that if, upon liquidation by deduction of present rental value from the present value of rent reserved, the difference exceeds the amount of the total rent for the three years succeeding the landlord's reentry, the claim may be allowed only for that amount.\n A more serious question is raised by the petitioners' insistence that thus applied the act exceeds legislative powers granted and infringes personal guaranties given by the Constitution. They say that the prescribed method will in some instances limit the amount allowed to a figure less than the landlord's actual ultimate loss, and thus partially destroy his remedy for enforcement of his contract. The resulting violations of the Constitution, they assert, are the transgression of the boundaries of the bankruptcy power vested in Congress, and the taking of their property without due process.\n Is the enactment in excess of the power to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies, conferred upon Congress by Article 1, section 8, of the Constitution? Congress evidently considered the limitation imposed on claims of this class necessary or advantageous to a successful reorganization and its judgment is conclusive upon us, if the enactment is within its power.\n The petitioners concede Congress has power to exclude contingent claims from proof and allowance so long as the obligations they represent are not extinguished by the statute. \n3\n They refer, however, to the statement in Louis \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n ville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106, that Congress has never attempted to supply a bankrupt with capital to engage in business at the expense of his creditors, as persuasive that a statute cannot discharge a bankrupt's assets from liability for his debts but can only discharge the bankrupt from encumbrances on his future exertions. \n4\n This principle, they assert, the statute violates. The short answer is that the object of bankruptcy laws is the equitable distribution of the debtor's assets amongst his creditors;5 and the validity of the challenged provision must be tested by its appropriateness to that end. Congress, in determining what such an equitable distribution demands, is free to establish standards of provability and measures of allowance regardless of the claimant's ability to maintain an action in a court or the measure of his recovery in such an action if maintainable. The contested provision is within the power of Congress. The exercise of the power is, nevertheless, subject to the commands of the Fifth Amendment. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Does the act offend the due process guaranty by destruction of rights conferred by the petitioners' contract? They affirm that it does, not merely by impairing those rights but by a direct taking pro tanto of all remedies for their enforcement and, to that extent, of the contract itself. Conceding they have no lien upon, or property right in, the debtor's assets, such as was the subject of decision in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, supra, they maintain that the Fifth Amendment assures them some effective procedure for the enforcement of the obligation of their contract; that the debtor's assets are a trust fund for creditors which cannot be invaded for the benefit of stockholders. As pointed out in the case last cited there is, as respects the exertion of the bankruptcy \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n power, a significant difference between a property interest and a contract since the Constitution does not forbid impairment of the obligation of the latter. The equitable distribution of the bankrupt's assets, or the equitable adjustment of creditors' claims in respect of those assets, by way of reorganization, may therefore be regulated by a bankruptcy law which impairs the obligation of the debtor's contracts. Indeed every Bankruptcy Act avowedly works such impairment. While, therefore, the Fifth Amendment forbids the destruction of a contract it does not prohibit bankruptcy legislation affecting the creditor's remedy for its enforcement against the debtor's assets, or the measure of the creditor's participation therein, if the statutory provisions are consonant with a fair, reasonable, and equitable distribution of those assets. The law under consideration recognizes the petitioners' claim and permits it to share in the consideration to be distributed in reorganization. The question is whether the remedy is circumscribed in so unreasonable and arbitrary a way as to deny due process.\n Bankruptcy originated as a seizure of the debtor's assets for equitable distribution amongst creditors. It was akin to a taking in execution. The concept was subsequently broadened to embrace the discharge of the embarrassed debtor from antecedent debts and to make the process available at his instance as well as at that of his creditors. Claims not provable, since they did not participate in the avails of the bankrupt's assets, were not discharged but remained recoverable by action against the discharged bankrupt. The object of section 77B was to extend the system to permit and facilitate the reorganization of certain types of insolvent or embarrassed business corporations. The theory of the legislation is that the extension will serve the interests of the public, the creditors, and the shareholders. \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n If the Bankruptcy Act was to be broadened to embrace reorganization of corporate debtors the wisdom of relieving them of continuing liability for rent or under contracts of indemnity was apparent. And if the landlords' claims were to be discharged in the reorganization they must be admitted to participation on an equitable basis with other claims in shaping the reorganization and in distribution of that which is to go to creditors pursuant to any plan adopted. The section therefore made such claims provable. Its legislative history attests the diverse views entertained in Congress as to the amount for which a claim should be allowed. Only after mature deliberation was the limit set at the amount fixed in the act. The reasonableness of the limitation is to be determined in the light of all circumstances Congress might properly consider.\n In City Bank Farmers Trust Company v. Irving Trust Company, \n299 \nU.S. 433\n, 57 S.Ct. 292, decided this day, the peculiar and unfortunate status of landlords' claims under the Bank ruptcy Act of 1898 is described. The tenant's bankruptcy removed all his assets from the reach of the landlord and left, as the latter's only remedy, suits against an empty corporate shell or a destitute individual. In framing the reorganization statute Congress obviously attempted to award landlords an equitable share in the debtor's assets as, in justice, it was bound to do since the purpose was to discharge the debtor from liability to future suits based upon the lease. It is incorrect to say that Congress took away all remedy under the lease. On the contrary, it gave a new and more certain remedy for a limited amount, in lieu of an old remedy inefficient and uncertain in its result. This is certainly not the taking of the landlord's property without due process.\n But we are told that if Congress determined to admit landlords' claims to a share in debtors' assets it was \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n bound by the Fifth Amendment not to be arbitrary in the allotment of such share or to discriminate between landlords and other creditors and between individual landlords. We cannot pronounce the limit set upon petitioners' claim arbitrary or unreasonable. It is well known that leases of business properties, particularly retail business properties, commonly run for long terms. The longer the term the greater the uncertainty as to the loss entailed by abrogation of the lease. Testimony as to present rental value partakes largely of the character of prophesy and, although that value is the cardinal factor in the measure of damages for which petitioners contend, it is obvious that, since the landlord is not bound to relet the premises for the unexpired term of the lease, that factor may have little real bearing upon the realities of the case. And, in any event, the possibility of the landlord's using the premises for his own purposes, their sale, their condemnation for public use, or their loss by foreclosure, renders an estimate of present rental value highly uncertain. Add to this the fact that bankruptcies multiply in hard times, and that estimates of rental value are made upon the basis of what a new tenant will pay in an era of economic depression, and the estimate becomes even more unreliable. Whatever courts, in the absence of a statutory formula, might feel compelled to adopt as the measure of damage in such a case, we cannot hold that Congress could not reasonably find that an award of the full difference between rental value and rent reserved for the remainder of the term smacks too much of speculation and that a uniform limit upon landlords' claims will, in the long run, be fair to them, to other creditors, and to the debtor.\n The petitioners insist that the amount to which the claim must be limited has no reasonable relation to the facts; that a sum equal to three times the annual rent can have no relation to the probable loss by the ending \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 455]\n\u00a0\n of the leasehold. But the rent reserved, broadly speaking, has some relationship to the value of the property and the value of a lease thereon. What the statute does, is to assure at least three full years' rent to a landlord whose possible loss may exceed that amount, evidently upon the theory that with such an allowance the landlord stands a reasonable chance of restoring himself to as good a position as if the lease had not been terminated.\n The petitioners say that by limiting their claim they are put upon a different basis from other creditors. A sufficient ground for the distinction is that petitioners get back their property. In other words, they have lost merely a bargain for the use of real estate whereas merchandise creditors, lenders, and others, recover in specie none of the property or money which passed from them to the debtor.\n Finally, it is said that the statute is whimsical and arbitrary in that the limit fixed upon landlords' claims necessarily represents a varying proportion of the actual loss of individual landlords and that this is discrimination of the most obvious sort. If, however, the statute does not deal unfairly with the petitioners it does not lie in their mouths to object because someone else perchance will receive a larger proportion of his ultimate loss as the same is ascertained years hence than will the petitioners. Congress, not unreasonably, felt that it was necessary, in the interest of expedition of proof and allowance of landlords' claims, which had never theretofore been permitted to share in a bankrupt debtor's assets, to fix a reasonable limit upon such claims. Naturally the smount fixed cannot bear the same relation to the ultimate loss or damage in every case. But it does not follow that, for this reason, all effort at uniformity of treatment of a peculiar class of claims, difficult of liquidation, is doomed to condemnation. All the arguments which petitioners submit would equally apply to any general and uniform formula \n\n[299 U.S. 445, 456]\n\u00a0\n for the limitation of such claims which the Congress might adopt. We are unable to say that that which Congress did select so discriminates between individual claimants to the detriment of the petitioners as to render it unconstitutional as to them.\n The judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kuhner v.

Boone, of Winton, N.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The controversy in this case relates to the liability to local taxation of certain bank deposits made by the petitioner as guardian of an incompetent veteran of the World War. Immunity was claimed under the federal statutes. World War Veterans' Act, 1924,  22,1 43 Stat.\n[ Lawrence v.

The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied the immunity (210 N.C. 352, 186 S.E. 504) and this Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 537\n. January 4, 1937.\n  The controversy was submitted to the state court upon an agreed case. It appeared that petitioner was appointed guardian in May, 1929, and that the veteran then owned no property other than claims against the United States for unpaid compensation and insurance. The tax date in North Carolina for property taxation is April 1st. In 1930 the guardian listed for taxation the property of his ward but the tax paid was refunded under a ruling of the Attorney General of the state, and in consequence no property of the ward was listed and no tax was paid in the subsequent years. In October, 1935, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 245\n, 247]\n\u00a0\n however, the tax officials assessed the ward's property for each of the years 1931 to 1935, inclusive. The property consisted of deposits in banks and real estate loans. No question is raised by the petitioner with respect to the taxability of the latter. See Trotter v. Tennessee, \n290 \nU.S. 354\n.\n  The agreed case showed the bank deposits as they stood on April 1st of each year. \n3\n It does not appear when the amounts making up these annual balances had been deposited or whether there was any special agreement relating to them. They are scheduled as 'deposits in bank,' without more. The stipulation states that they 'represented and, in fact, were the collections from warrants or checks drawn and issued by the United States Government in payment of compensation and insurance' due to the ward, that these warrants or checks were deposited by the guardian and credited in his bank account, and that the items assessed were 'the unexpended and uninvested balances,' in the hands of the guardian, of the payments thus made by the government. \n4\n Petitioner paid the taxes under protest and demanded refund which was refused. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 245\n, 248]\n\u00a0\n  We are not concerned with the questions submitted to the state court upon the agreed case so far as they related to the authority of officials under the state law to impose the tax in 1935 for the preceding years. The present contention is presented by the answer to the first question which was as follows: 'Where a guardian of a World War Veteran receives from the Veterans' Bureau of the United States Government, warrants or checks issued by said Government in payment of adjusted compensation or insurance due the guardian's ward, and said warrants or checks are deposited by the guardian in a depository, collected by it, and the proceeds are credited in the guardian's account carried in such depository, are such deposits subject to taxation by county and municipal authorities'?\n  The state court answered this question in the affirmative, denying the federal right asserted.\n  In Trotter v. Tennessee, supra, we considered the provision of section 22 of the World War Veterans' Act 1924,5 in relation to investments by the guardian of an incompetent veteran of the moneys received from the government for compensation and insurance. We held that land purchased by the guardian with such moneys was not exempt. We said: 'The statute speaks of 'compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable' to the veteran and declares that these shall be exempt. We see no token of a purpose to extend a like immunity to permanent investments or the fruits of business enterprises. Veterans who choose to trade in land or in merchandise, in bonds or in shares of stock, must pay their tribute to the state.' Id., \n290 \nU.S. 354\n, at pages 356, 357, 139.\n  Having no doubt that the moneys payable by the government to the veteran were exempt until they came \n\n[300 \nU.S. 245\n, 249]\n\u00a0\n into his hands or those of his guardian, we left the question open 'whether the exemption remained in force while they continued in those hands or on deposit in a bank.' The World War Veterans' Act, 1924, provided that the compensation and insurance allowances should be 'exempt from all taxation.' The Act of 19356 is more specific, providing that the payments shall be exempt from taxation and shall not be liable to process 'either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.' There was added the qualification that the exemption should not extend 'to any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.' This more detailed provision was substituted for that of the earlier act and was expressly made applicable to payments theretofore made. We think it clear that the provision of the later act was intended to clarify the former rather than to change its import and it was with that purpose that it was made retroactive. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n  The state court found no distinction with respect to taxability 'between stocks and bonds, and notes and bank deposits and other solvent credits.' Amplifying this position, counsel for respondent at this bar, while conceding that the warrants or checks issued by the government would be exempt, and that if they were cashed the moneys thus received would likewise be exempt until they were invested, contended that if the guardian instead of cashing the warrants or checks deposited them in bank, the resulting bank credits would be taxable. We think that this contention is inadmissible. Congress has declared that the payments of benefits by the government shall be exempt not only before but 'after receipt by the beneficiary.' We cannot conceive that it was the intent of Congress that the veteran should lose the bene- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 245\n, 250]\n\u00a0\n fit of this immunity, which would attach to the moneys in his hands, by depositing the government warrants or checks in bank to be collected and credited in the usual manner. These payments are intended primarily for the maintenance and support of the veteran. To that end neither he nor his guardian is obliged to keep the moneys on his person or under his roof. As the immunity from taxation is continued after the payments are received, the usual methods of receipt must be deemed available so that the amounts paid by the government may be properly safeguarded and used as the needs of the veteran may require.\n  The provision of the Act of 1935 that the exemption should not apply to property purchased out of the moneys received from the government shows the intent to deny exemption to investments, as was ruled in the Trotter Case. It is of course true that deposits in bank may be made under a special agreement by which the deposits assume the character of investments and would lose immunity accordingly. No such agreement is shown here. Nor are the bank balances shown to be the proceeds of investments. They are stipulated to be 'uninvested balances' of the government payments. Some reference was made at the bar to the possible effect of an allowance of interest upon bank deposits. It does not appear that there was such an allowance in this instance, and we do not suggest that a mere allowance of interest upon deposits would be enough to destroy an immunity where it would otherwise attach. We hold that the immunity from taxation does attach to bank credits of the veteran or his guardian which do not represent or flow from his investments but result from the deposit of the warrants or checks received from the government when such deposits are made in the ordinary manner so that the proceeds of the collection are subject to draft upon demand for the veteran's use. In order to carry out the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 245\n, 251]\n\u00a0\n intent of the statute, the avails of the government warrants or checks must be deemed exempt until they are expended or invested.\n  The answer by the state court is broad enough to cover bank deposits of that sort and we consider the ruling in that application to be contrary to the federal statute. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 22 provides:\n'Sec. 22.

Such tax is imposed on all chewing and smoking tobacco. ... The tax accrues on such manufactures upon removal from the factory or place where they were made, or upon sale prior to such removal, and is to be paid by the manufacturer thereof by the affixing of stamps before removal. ...' Art. 52: 'Each package containing a statutory quantity of tobacco or snuff (see article 45) shall, before removal from the bonded factory premises where made, have affixed thereto the proper internal-revenue stamps or stamps of such denomination as will cover fully the tax on the net weight of the contents. ...'

It maintains a bonded warehouse for storing such products. The established internal revenue procedure was to affix the required stamps upon manufactured tobacco before removal from the factory. In January, 1932, the company received from Massachusetts an order to deliver 96 pounds of tobacco to the Boston State Hospital, an institution owned and maintained by the Commonwealth. The company complied by shipping from its bonded warehouse four packages to which revenue stamps amounting to $17.28 had theretofore been affixed. This was distributed to patients without charge. Hospital patients, when able, pay for treatment. The hospital performs useful public service. A bill for $30. 62-price of the tobacco including tax-was paid by the Commonwealth.\n And the Court held that operation of the hospital by the Commonwealth is not the performance of an essential governmental function; that such operation is not of a strictly governmental character, since it does not 'embody some kind of control over persons or things which can be exercised only by a sovereign power.' And for that reason the conclusion was that no immunity from federal taxation had been shown. All of the petitions were dismissed. \n\n[299 U.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n Here counsel for the Commonwealth submit that the maintenance of the hospital is a true governmental function entitled to immunity; also that the tax in question was laid upon the sale of the tobacco and amounted to an imposition upon the Commonwealth. They rely upon the principle approved in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 222\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 452, 56 A.L.R. 583, Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 578\n, 51 S.Ct. 601, 604, and Graves v. Texas Co., \n298 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 818.\n For the United States, it is said the tax was upon the manufacture of the tobacco with duty of payment postponed until removal or sale, whichever first occurred; consequently, there was no direct burden imposed upon the state; the effect was incidental, indirect, and permissible within the doctrine approved by Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418\n, 24 S.Ct. 383, and Wheeler Lumber B. & S. Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572, 579\n, 50 S.Ct. 419, 421.\n If, in reality, the tax was upon the manufacture of tobacco, then, as adequately pointed out by Cornell v. Coyne, supra, the effect upon the purchaser was indirect and imposed no prohibited burden. See Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 230\n, 234 S., 51 S.Ct. 125, 128, 130, 71 A.L. R. 1260. We think that was the true nature of the exaction, and this renders unnecessary any consideration of the theory accepted by the Court below.\n The tax is laid upon each pound of manufactured tobacco irrespective of intrinsic value or price obtained upon sale. The goods may be disposed of at any price without affecting the amount of the tax; that does not vary. Always the manufacturer must pay 18 cents upon each pound-no more, no less. True the limit of time for making payment is when the product is sold or removed, but this is a privilege designed to mitigate the burden; it indicates no purpose to impose the tax upon either sale or removal. Apparently the practice is to affix the required stamps without regard to sale or removal. \n\n[299 U.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n See Cornell v. Coyne, supra; American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522; Wheeler Lumber B. & S. Co. v. United States, supra.\n Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, supra, much relied upon by petitioner, considered a tax of 5 per centum of the price obtained upon sale of the article; it rose or fell according to the amount received by the seller. From the outset, the excise there under scrutiny had been considered by Congressional Committees and the administrative bureau as a sales tax. Here the administrative provisions of the taxing act indicate that Congress regarded it as an excise on manufacture. And this view is strengthened by provisions of the Treasury Regulations designed to carry the statute into effect.\n For the reasons indicated, the judgment below must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINDSEY v.

Ed. --, to review a decision of the Supreme Court of Washington, 187 Wash. 364, 61 P.(2d) 293, that chapter 114, page 308, of the Laws of Washington, 1935, under which petitioners were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, is not an ex post facto law prohibited by article 1,  10, of the Federal Constitution.\n Petitioners were convicted in the state court of the crime of grand larceny, made a felony by state law, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 397, 398]\n\u00a0\n section 2601(2), Remington Rev.Stat., and sentenced to be punished by confinement in the state penitentiary and reformatory respectively for terms of not more than fifteen years. On April 15, 1935, the date of the commission of the offense, the prescribed penalty for grand larceny was imprisonment 'for not more than fifteen years.' No minimum term was prescribed. Remington Rev.Stat.,  2605. On that date, the statutes also provided, Remington Rev.Stat.  2281, for indeterminate sentences for any felony 'for which no fixed period of confinement is imposed by law.' All such sentences were required to be 'for a term not less than the minimum nor greater than the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law for the offense ... and where no minimum term of imprisonment is prescribed by law, the court shall fix the same in his discretion at not less than six months nor more than five years.' Section 2282, as modified by section 10803, provided for a parole board which could 'at any time after the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment ... direct that any prisoner ... shall be released on parole.'\n The Act of June 12, 1935 (Laws 1935, p. 308), enacted after petitioners' commission of the offense and before his sentence, modifies the sections relating to indeterminate sentences and paroles and provides, so far as now relevant, section 2, paragraph 1, that upon conviction of a felony 'the court ... shall fix the maximum term of such person's sentence only. The maximum term to be fixed by the court shall be the maximum provided by law for the crime of which such person was convicted, if the law provides for a maximum term.' It also provides, section 2, paragraph 4, that within six months after the admission of a convicted person to the place of confinement the board of prison, terms and paroles ' ... shall fix the duration of his or her confinement. The term of imprisonment so fixed shall not exceed the maximum provided by law for the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 397, 399]\n\u00a0\n offense for which he or she was convicted or the maximum fixed by the court, where the law does not provide for a maximum term.'\n By section 2, paragraph 6, if the person undergoing sentence commits any infraction of the rules and regulations of the place of confinement, the board '... may revoke any order theretofore made determining the length of time such convicted person shall be imprisoned and make a new order determining the length of time he or she shall serve, not exceeding the maximum penalty provided by law for the crime for which he or she was convicted.' It is provided, section 4, that a convicted person may be released on parole by the board after he has served the period of confinement fixed by the board, less time credits for good behavior and diligence which may not exceed 'one-third of his sentence as fixed by the board,' and that the board shall have power '... to return such person to the confines of the institution from which he or she was paroled, at its discretion.' The Governor is authorized to cancel and revoke paroles granted by the board, and the period following cancellation or revocation of parole, and prior to the convicted person's return to custody, is not a 'part of his term.'\n The sentences of not more than fifteen years imposed on petitioners were the maximum provided by law, and were made mandatory by the act of 1935. In obedience to its command the court fixed no minimum. It does not appear from the record whether the board of prison, terms and paroles has fixed the 'duration' of petitioners' 'confinement.' Numerous grounds are urged by petitioners in support of their contention that the sentence authorized by the later statute is ex post facto as applied to their offense, committed before its enactment. We find it necessary to consider only one.\n In sustaining the sentence the Supreme Court of Washington, without analysis or comparison of the prac- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 397, 400]\n\u00a0\n tical operation of the two statutes, declared 'The amending act does not change or inflict a greater punishment than the law in force when the alleged crime was committed for the court could under the law in force at that time pronounce a maximum sentence of not more than fifteen years. The minimum and maximum punishments remain the same as before the enactment of the act of 1935.' This Court, in applying the ex post facto prohibition of the Federal Constitution to state laws, accepts the meaning ascribed to them by the highest court of the state. But when their meaning is thus established, whether the standards of punishment set up before and after the commission of an offense differ, and whether the later standard is more onerous than the earlier within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition, are federal questions which this Court will determine for itself. Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 320, reversing State v. Cummings, 36 Mo. 263, 273; Kring v. Missouri, \n107 \nU.S. 221, 223\n, 224 S., 231, 232, 2 S.Ct. 443. To answer them we compare the practical operation of the two statutes as applied to petitioners' offense.\n Under the earlier section 2281, as the state concedes, the prisoners could have been sentenced for a maximum term less than the fifteen-year penalty authorized by the statute. Under the later statute, the sentence by the court, as commanded by section 2, was for fifteen years, and the 'duration of confinement' to be fixed by the board of prison, terms and paroles may be for any number of years not exceeding fifteen.\n The effect of the new statute is to make mandatory what was before only the maximum sentence. Under it the prisoners may be held to confinement during the entire fifteen-year period. Even if they are admitted to parole, to which they become eligible after the expiration of the terms fixed by the board, they remain subject to its surveillance and the parole may, until the expira- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 397, 401]\n\u00a0\n tion of the fifteen years, be revoked at the discretion of the board or canceled at the will of the governor. It is true that petitioners might have been sentenced to fifteen years under the old statute. But the ex post facto clause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed by a statute, rather than to the sentence actually imposed. The Constitution forbids the application of any new punitive measure to a crime already consummated, to the detriment or material disadvantage of the wrongdoer. Kring v. Missouri, supra, \n107 \nU.S. 221, 228\n, 229 S., 2 S.Ct. 443; In re Medley, \n134 \nU.S. 160, 171\n, 10 S.Ct. 384; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 351\n, 18 S.Ct. 620. It is for this reason that an increase in the possible penalty is ex post facto, Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390; Cummings v. Missuri, supra, 4 Wall. 277, 326; Malloy v. South Carolina, \n237 \nU.S. 180, 184\n, 35 S. Ct. 507, regardless of the length of the sentence actually imposed, since the measure of punishment prescribed by the later statute is more severe than that of the earlier, State v. Callahan, 109 La. 946, 33 So. 931; State v. Smith, 56 Or. 21, 107 P. 980.\n Removal of the possibility of a sentence of less than fifteen years, at the end of which petitioners would be freed from further confinement and the tutelage of a parole revocable at will, operates to their detriment in the sense that the standard of punishment adopted by the new statute is more onerous than that of the old. It could hardly be thought that, if a punishment for murder of life imprisonment or death were changed to death alone, the latter penalty could be applied to homicide committed before the change. Marion v. State, 16 Neb. 349, 20 N.W. 289. Yet this is only a more striking instance of the detriment which ensues from the revision of a statute providing for a maximum and minimum punishment by making the maximum compulsory. We need not inquire whether this is technically an increase in the punishment annexed to the crime, see Calder v. Bull, supra, 3 Dall. 386, 390. It is plainly to the substantial disadvantage \n\n[301 \nU.S. 397, 402]\n\u00a0\n of petitioners to be deprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would give them freedom from custody and control prior to the expiration of the fifteen-year term.\n Petitioners were wrongly sentenced under the act of 1935. Whether, in consequence of the invalidity of the later act, as applied to petitioners, they may be sentenced under the earlier, is a question for the state court.\n The cause will be reversed and remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISIANA & A R.

Millar, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. N. Cromwell, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for infringement of claims 1, 3 to 14, inclusive, 17, 18, and 21 to 24, inclusive, of the Blair patent, No. 1,435,199 for a heat- insulated receptacle. The District Court held all of the claims invalid by reason of lack of invention, prior invention, anticipation, as being for an aggregation and as involving only mechanical skill. That court further limited the claims to the particular structure disclosed in the application, and, so limited, held them not infringed. It also found that unreasonable delay in filing disclaimers voided all the claims. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decree dismissing the bill. \n1\n We granted certiorari because of a conflict of decision.\n In 1927 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held all of the claims here in suit, except claim 3, bad for want of invention. \n2\n In 1931 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held claim 1 valid and infringed 'without prejudice to any rights of the plaintiff under any other claim.' \n3\n In as much as the conflict is limited to claim 1 we restrict our consideration to that claim. The claim is:\n'A heat-insulated vessel of the non-vacuum type having an outer jacket of non-frangible material, an inner container of frangible material, said inner container being bonded to and pendently supported from said jacket, and heat-insulating and shock-absorbing means surrounding said container for limiting oscillations of said container \n\n[301 \nU.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n while permitting expansion thereof by changes of temperature.'\n\n Over thirty years ago containers for keeping their contents hot or cold by the use of a vacuum came into general use. It was found impractical to make such containers of a capacity in excess of one quart or perhaps two quarts. For some years thereafter there were no satisfactory insulated containers of larger size. In 1919 Blair filed application for a patent for a heat insulated receptacle of the non-vacuum type, his object being economically to produce relatively large receptacles which would be sanitary and easy to clean, to improve their insulation to minimize the transmission of shocks to the inner container which was of glass or other fragile substance. As disclosed by the claim in question he proposed to make a jug or pail-like container the outer jacket of which would be of iron or similar rigid material. Within this there was an inner container of glass (or, as in the commercial article, of earthenware) bonded to and pendently supported from the outer jacket. Between the inner and outer members comminuted material, such as ground cork, was to be inserted for insulating the inner container, limiting its oscillations and permitting its expansion due to changes of temperature.\n We pass the questions of infringement and failure promptly to disclaim after the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held the claims invalid in 1927, since we hold that the patent does not disclose invention.\n We are of opinion that all the elements of the patent were old and aggregation of them did not involve the exercise of inventive genius but of mechanical adaptation. Containers comprising an inner receptacle and an outer casing, the interspace filled with comminuted material, were old. The packing of the space had been practiced both to protect the inner container from shock and to insulate it. The pendulant support of the inner member \n\n[301 \nU.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n by the casing was old. Such pendulant support had been supplied by screwing the threaded neck of the glass container into the threaded neck of the casing, by superimposing an annular flange on the one over a corresponding flange on the other, and by other mechanical means. The petitioner says, however, that novelty and invention are found in the use of a bond to unite the inner and outer members. As to this its brief states: 'The patentee says in his patent that he prefers to use the adherent bond described but the disclosure of the patent is not so limited and is broad enough to include any bond either a mechanical or an adherent bond.' It is also said that the bond shown in the drawings and described in the specifications acts as a seal at the neck of the container to prevent liquids from seeping into the insulating material and impairing its usefulness. Accepting the view that to bond two articles can signify no more than to unite them firmly by any means, we find in the prior art the bonding of container and casing by mechanical means and by the use of cement and plaster of paris. Invention cannot inhere in Blair's employment of either mode of union. The claim says nothing about the sealing effect of the bond, but if interpretation of the claim by reference to the specification might supply this element, the prior art shows instances of such sealing by the use of an impervious binding material such as cement, and earlier patents claim this sealing as an element of the invention described.\n In short, anyone familiar with the prior art needed only by exercise of mechanical skill to combine known methods and structures and so attain the combination exhibited in the patent. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 86 F.(2d) 509. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Macomb Mfg. Co. v. Mantle Lamp Co. of America, 22 F.(2d) 93; Monarch Co., Inc. v.

The statute called for a bond with a good and sufficient surety conditioned to the effect that the contractor would promptly make payment to all persons supplying the principal with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work. 40 \nU.S.C.  270 (40 \nU.S.C.A .  270); American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Co., \n296 \nU.S. 133, 135\n, 10. Such a bond was given in the sum of $25, 000 by the National Surety Company, acting through Guy S. Martin, its agent. Martin, who is the petitioner in this court, had been ordered by one of the officers of the company not to execute the bond, and in signing it disobeyed the order. The fact of disobedience was unknown to the obligee, and by concession the bond is binding according to its terms. In a written application the contractor stated to the surety that he had not assigned and would not assign to third persons his payments on the contract or any part thereof. In further consideration of the execution of the bond he did by the same instrument assign the payments to the surety in the event of any breach or default in the contract, the proceeds to be credited upon any loss or damage.* There \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 591]\n\u00a0\n was also a covenant of indemnity, and a covenant that in the event of the filing of any liens there would be a deposit with the surety sufficient to secure them.\n  Martin's agency was canceled after the writing of the bond in breach of his instructions. With full knowledge of the application and of the duties there assumed, he loaned moneys to the contractor from time to time under an agreement for the division of the profits of the enterprise. By December, 1932, when the building was near completion, the total of these loans was in excess of $10,000, exclusive of any interest. The work had been done to the satisfaction of the Government, but bills for labor and materials were largely in default. The surety became alarmed. In the latter part of December an officer of the company gave notice to the tontractor that the company would insist upon the execution of a power of attorney for the collection of any payments then owing from the Government or falling due thereafter. Tobin took the document away with him, promising to show it to his lawyer. Instead he showed it to Martin, for whose benefit he signed another power of attorney as well as a letter, addressed to the Treasury Department, directing that all checks for Tobin should thereafter go to Martin. These documents were intended to have the effect of an assignment which would be security to Martin for the amount of his advances. Both documents were forwarded to the Treasury as soon as they were signed. The surety did not know of them till five or six weeks later. At last, on Feb- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 592]\n\u00a0\n ruary 4, 1933, Tobin, pressed again to carry out his agreement, admitted that the power of attorney had been turned over to Martin, but promised to try to get it back. Even then there was denial that it was on file in the Treasury. But the promise, even if sincere, was no longer susceptible of fulfillment. On the very day it was made, Martin had gone to Washington, had visited the Treasury, and had received from the Government a warrant for $10,488.10, the progress or deferred payments then due upon the contract. This sum he collected on February 6, and applied upon his loans. At that time the building was substantially completed, though there was still owing from the Government $5,700, made up of a retained percentage plus a small additional amount to cover unfinished work.\n  The surety ascertained the truth a day or two thereafter. On February 9, 1933, it brought suit in a District Court in Missouri to protect the interests of the materialmen and laborers, joining Tobin and Martin as defendants as well as certain officers of the Government. It prayed inter alia that the moneys received by Martin be impounded, and that the fund, when deposited in court, be disbursed in payment of the bills for material and labor, and in exoneration of the bond. At the beginning of the suit, Tobin was already insolvent. The surety became insolvent later, and renounced in favor of the materialmen and laborers all its rights and interests in the fund in litigation. Martin, yielding to the compulsion of interlocutory decrees, paid into the registry of the court what he had collected from the Government. After notice to materialmen and laborers to file their claims against the fund, the court made a final decree disposing of the controversy. Martin's claim was dismissed on the ground that he was a partner with the contractor, and could gain nothing by his assignment except in subordination to the creditors. The claims of materialmen and laborers (here \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 593]\n\u00a0\n inafter, for convenience, referred to as materialmen) were considered and adjudicated, and distribution was decreed.\n  The case went to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upon an appeal by Martin. The decree was there affirmed. 85 F.(2d) 135. Without disputing the finding that Martin was to share with Tobin in the profits of the enterprise, the Court of Appeals did not pass upon the question whether the relation was one of partnership. It placed its ruling upon the broad ground that, apart from any assignment or any statute, the proceeds of a building contract are chargeable in favor of materialmen with an equitable lien, which attaches upon collection, even if not before, and which cannot be overridden at the will of the contractor by payment to his other creditors, though the payment be made in fulfillment of a promise. For this it cited Belknap Hardware & Mfg. Co. v. Ohio River Contract Co. ( C.C.A.) 271 F. 144, and United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Sweeney ( C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 235, 238, conceding the existence of other cases contra; Third Nat. Bank v. Detroit Fidelity & Surety Co. (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 548; Kane v. First Nat. Bank of El Paso, Texas (C.C.A.) 56 F.(2d) 534, 85 A.L.R. 362; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Union State Bank (D.C.) 21 F.(2d) 102. The opinion dwells upon the confusion in which the subject is enveloped. We granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 536\n.\n  Our decision will be kept within the necessities of the specific controversy here. Even so, the grounds chosen, though narrower than those assigned below, may be expected to be helpful as a guide in other cases. The proceeds of the contract, when collected by Martin under his power of attorney, were received by him with knowledge of the agreement between the contractor and the surety whereby such proceeds became a fund to be devoted in the first instance to the payment of materialmen and others similarly situated. In our view of the law, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 594]\n\u00a0\n the equities in favor of materialmen growing out of that agreement were impressed upon the fund in the possession of the court.\n  An act of Congress tells us that all transfers and assignments 'of any claim upon the United States * * * and all powers of attorney, orders, or other authorities for receiving payment of any such claim * * * shall be absolutely null and void, unless they are freely made and executed in the presence of at least two attesting witnesses, after the allowance of such a claim, the ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof.' Rev.St.  3477, 31 \nU.S.C.  203 (31 \nU.S. C.A.  203). By force of that pronouncement the Government was at liberty to hold the money back till demanded by the contractor personally, disregarding any assignment or power of attorney for its payment to another. But the Government did not choose to shape its course accordingly. It turned over the money to Martin as Tobin's representative, thus discharging its indebtedness as effectively as if payment had been made directly to the principal. McKnight v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 179\n. The case is to be viewed as if Tobin had received the warrant, had put the proceeds in his bank, and had paid them afterwards to Martin. Will Martin be allowed to keep them in the face of his knowledge of the earlier assignment to the surety and of the promise that no assignment would be made to any one else?\n  The provisions of the statute making void an assignment or power of attorney by a Government contractor are for the protection of the Government. Hobbs v. McLean, \n117 \nU.S. 567, 576\n, 874; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 295. In the absence of such a rule, the Government would be in danger of becoming embroiled in conflicting claims, with delay and embarrassment and the chance of multiple liability. Hobbs v. McLean, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 595]\n\u00a0\n supra. But as applied to the fund in controversy, that peril is now past. The fund is in court to be distributed to rival claimants, with the Government discharged irrespective of the outcome. The very fact that an assignment is permitted even as between the contractor and the Government itself when the warrant is outstanding, if the transfer be executed with prescribed formalities, is significant that the Government is not concerned to regulate the equities of claimants growing out of irregular assignments when collection is complete and liability is ended. The purpose of the statute 'was not to dictate to the contractor what he should do with the money received on his contract after the contract had been performed.' Hobbs v. McLean, supra. A transfer of a warrant has need to be accompanied by safeguards lest the assignor may avoid it afterwards for forgery or fraud. A transfer of the fund after payment is perfected is of no concern to any one except the parties to the transaction, and this quite irrespective of the time of the assignment or the manner of its making.\n  If the Government has any interest in the outcome of this controversy it is in sustaining the assignment to the surety rather than destroying it. The contractor undertook that materialmen would receive their money promptly while the work was going on. In failing to pay them, he violated a duty to them, but a duty also to the Government, for the default was a breach of the condition of the bond. If the assignment to the surety creates a lien upon the fund, the contractor will be compelled to fulfill the duty thus assumed. A different question would be present if the surety were seeking to keep the money for itself. Cf. American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Co., supra; Jenkins v. National Surety Co., 277 U.s,. 258, 266, 446. There is no such effort here. On the contrary, the surety claiming nothing for \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 596]\n\u00a0\n itself, is devoting the full proceeds of the assignment to the satisfaction of the liabilities covered by the bond. Has the assignment been so obliterated through the condemnation of the statute that when used by the surety in aid of such a purpose it does not generate an equity worthy of recognition?\n  The advocates of literalism find color of support in a line of decisions made in very different circumstances from these, but tending none the less to a strict construction of the statute. National Bank of Commerce v. Downie, \n218 \nU.S. 345, 20\n Ann.Cas. 1116; Nutt v. Knut, \n200 \nU.S. 12\n; Spofford v. Kirk, \n97 \nU.S. 484\n; United States v. Gillis, \n95 \nU.S. 407\n. We do not pause to inquire with reference to all the cases whether the necessities of the judgment were as broad as the words of the opinion. Thus, in National Bank of Commerce v. Downie, supra, to give a single illustration, where the controversy was between the trustee in bankruptcy of the contractor and prior assignees, the claims against the Government which were the subject of the assignment had never been allowed, much less collected, though the decision cannot be said to have been put on that ground. Another line of cases exhibit an opposing tendency. Lay v. Lay, \n248 \nU.S. 24\n; Portuguese-American Bank v. Welles, \n242 \nU.S. 7, 11\n, 12, Ann.Cas.1918D, 643; McGowan v. Parish, supra; Freedman's Saving Co. v. Shepherd, \n127 \nU.S. 494, 506\n; Hobbs v. McLean, supra; Bailey v. United States, \n109 \nU.S. 432, 439\n; Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 \nU.S. 556, 559\n; McKnight v. United States, supra; Erwin v. United States, \n97 \nU.S. 392\n. Cf. York v. Conde, 147 N.Y. 486, 42 N.E. 193, dismissed \n168 \nU.S. 642\n. These cases teach us that the statute must be interpreted in the light of its purpose to give protection to the Government. After payments have been collected and are in the hands of the contractor or subsequent payees with notice, assignments may be heeded, at all events in equity, if they will not frustrate the ends to which the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 597]\n\u00a0\n prohibition was directed. See Lay v. Lay, supra, affirming 118 Miss. 549, 79 So. 291. To the extent that the two lines of cases are in conflict, the second must be held to be supported by the better reason. Many an analogy from fields uncovered by the statute reinforces that conclusion.\n  An assignment ineffective at law may none the less amount to the creation of an equitable lien when the subject matter of the assignment has been reduced to possession and is in the hands of the assignor or of persons claiming under him with notice. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Shepard, 169 N.Y. 170, 62 N.E. 154, 58 L.R.A. 115; Walker v. Brown, \n165 \nU.S. 654\n; Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, \n165 \nU.S. 634\n; Ketchum v. St. Louis, \n101 \nU.S. 306\n. All this is familiar law. No reason is discoverable in the policy of the statute why the analogy should be rejected in its application to the case at hand. Far from defeating or prejudicing the interests of the Government, the recognition of the equities growing out of the relation between the contractor and the surety will tend, as already has been suggested, to make those interests prevail. Cf. Equitable Surety Co. v. U. S. to Use of McMillan & Son, \n234 \nU.S. 448, 456\n. It would be a strange construction of the statute that would make it necessary for the Government to declare the equities illusory when they serve its own good.\n  In what has been written we have assumed that the failure to pay materialmen was a default of such a nature as to impose a duty on the contractor to turn over the payments to the surety upon appropriate demand. There is argument to the contrary. According to that argument the moneys were to be assigned in the event of default in the performance of the contract between the contractor and the Government, and not upon the failrue to pay persons other than the Government who had claims against the contractor for materials or labor. But the statute directs that a bond for the prompt payment of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 588\n, 598]\n\u00a0\n materialmen and laborers shall be executed by the contractor before the commencement of the work. Not only that, but the contract with the Government, which was drawn in the standard form, is a confirmation and adoption of the statutory duty. The terms of the bond are read into the contract, and there is default under the contract when there is dafault under the bond.\n  We conclude that Martin's interest in the fund was correctly held to be subordinate to the interests of other claimants. Without denying the possibility of arriving at the same conclusion through other avenues of approach, we follow the pathway that has been marked in this opinion.\n  The decree should be\n  Affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The assignment reads as follows: 'That in further consideration of the execution of said bond, the undersigned hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to the Company all the deferred payments and retained percentages, and any and all moneys and properties that may be due and payable to the undersigned at the time of any breach or default in said contract, or that thereafter may become due and payable to the undersigned on account of said contract, or on account of extra work or materials supplied in connection therewith, hereby agreeing that such money, and the proceeds of such payments and properties shall be the sole property of the Company and to be by it credited upon any loss, cost, damage, charge and expense sustained or incurred by it under said bond.' \n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATOS V.

Animals and cattle suffering from contagious diseases shall not be the object of a contract of sale. Any contract made with regard to the same shall be void. A contract of sale of cattle and animals shall also be void, when the use or service for which they are acquired being stated, they are found to be useless therefor.'\n\n'Sec. 1399. The redhibitory action, based on the vices or defects of animals, must be instituted within forty days, counted from their delivery to the vendee, unless, by reason of the customs in each locality, longer or shorter periods are established. This action in the sale of animals may only be enforced with regard to the vices and defects of the same, determined by law or by local customs.' Rev.St. & Codes 1913,  4503, 4505.\n\n  Several sections of the Island's Penal Code interdict sale or possession of animals suffering from a contagious disease.\n  A complaint filed by respondents, Alonso Hermanos et al., in the District Court of San Juan, December 12, 1929, alleged that they purchased March 1, 1929, from petitioner, Jose Matos, a herd of cattle-122 head-for the lump sum of $18,000; although apparently in good condition the cattle were suffering from tuberculosis, a contagious disease; prior to December 6th 43 had died, 29 were condemned and destroyed by the Health Department. They further declared readiness to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 429\n, 431]\n\u00a0\n return all surviving cattle and prayed that the sale be declared null and void, in accordance with section 1397 of the Civil Code, also for judgment for the purchase price.\n  A demurrer invoking the limitation of forty days upon redhibitory actions, prescribed by Code section 1399, was overruled. An answer followed. This admitted execution of the contract, receipt of the consideration, death, and condemnation of the cattle as alleged. But it affirmed that tuberculosis was contracted after the sale through improper care; also renewed the claim of prescription.\n  The trial court found the facts shown by the evidence; concluded the questioned contract was illegal and void, that the action was not subject to the prescription of forty days; and ordered return of the entire purchase price.\n  Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled the sale contract was not void but voidable at the purchaser's election; its legal effect and the remedy for violation were within the Code provisions relating to redhibitory contracts; the limitation of forty days applied; 'that section 1397 does not exclude the transaction made in this case from the field of warranties.' Also, the contract for the purchase of the herd was 'individual' or 'distributive'-not unitary; as to the dead cows the right to recover the purchase price was prescribed; as to those which survived no right of recovery ever existed. It accordingly reversed the judgment of the District Court and directed dismissal of the complaint.\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals held the contract of sale illegal- nonexistent-as to cows which had died or were condemned; as to them the action was not redhibitory; the prescription of forty days had no application; and it reversed the questioned judgment. 81 F.(2d) 930, 933. With respect to the surviving cows, it adopted the interpretation of section 1397 approved by the Supreme Court. It said: 'To sum- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 429\n, 432]\n\u00a0\n marize: In the trial court the plaintiffs put their claim on the herd basis; they endeavored to rescind the entire transaction and get back the full consideration which had been paid; and they were held entitled to do so. On appeal the Supreme Court held that the sale could not be given this unitary character, but must be considered with respect to the individual animals; and that view stands. In its decision that, as to the tuberculous cattle, a contract was entered into and the plaintiffs' rights were of redhibitory character and subject to the limitation of section 1399, the Supreme Court fell into error.'\n  Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court was reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with instructions to permit an amedment to the complaint. A dissenting opinion approved the Supreme Court's construction of the Code, also its judgment.\n  The matter is here by certiorari. Manifestly, the solution of the controversy must turn upon the meaning and effect of the above-quoted sections of the Civil Code-local law of Puerto Rico.\n  Considering the argument here, the divergent views below, the authorities cited, and 'recognizing the deference due to the understanding of local courts upon matters of purely local concern,' it becomes impossible for us to entertain 'a sense of clear error committed' by the Supreme Court. Following the view so often approved, we think the Circuit Court of Appeals should have accepted and affirmed the ruling there announced after much consideration. Nadal v.

ROSE(1937)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. William A. Sutherland, of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Guy Patten, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This petition for certiorari raises the question whether overpayments of income taxes for the calendar years 1929, 1930, and 1931 are so related to a tax on income which should have been but was not assessed against the taxpayer for the year 1928, as to preclude recovery of the overpayments, although collection of the 1928 tax is barred by the statute of limitations.\n In 1924, petitioner's decedent sold 500 shares of the corporate stock of an insurance company for the sum of $300,000, at a net profit of $295, 000 over 1918 cost. Ten per cent. of the purchase price was paid at the time of sale and the balance was to be paid in installments, aggregating annually 10 per cent. of the purchase price, in each of the nine succeeding years. As permitted by the applicable statutes (section 202, Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 255; sections 202, 212, Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 11, 23; section 44, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 805, 26 U.S.C.A.  44 and note), decedent elected to return the profit for income taxation on the installment basis. After his death in 1928, petitioner, as his administrator, filed income tax returns in behalf of his estate for the calendar years 1928 to 1931, inclusive, showing in each year a sale of 50 shares of the stock of the insurance company at a net profit of $29,500. These returns were erroneous in point of fact and of law, as the petitioner sold no shares of the stock in any of those years, and since, by reason of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n provisions of section 44(d) of the 1928 act,1 the capital gain included in the value of the unpaid installments at the time of decedent's death was income taxable to decedent for the year 1928, and not in subsequent years.\n By the provisions of section 44(d), as construed by Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 355, the transmission of an installment obligation at the death of the payee capitalizes the unpaid installments of the contract and results in taxable gain to the estate of the decedent, measured by the difference between the fair market value of the obligation at the time of his death and its unrecovered cost. By section 113 of the 1928 act (26 U.S. C.A.  113 note), the basis for computing the annual profit upon the installments paid after the decedent's death is the fair market value of the contract at the time of his death. The unpaid tax for 1928, computed as required by section 44(d), exceeds the sum of the overpayments made in 1929, 1930, and 1931\n\n\n On the trial in the district court, the collector contended that petitioner was estopped to deny that the sales of stock occurred and profit accrued as reported in his returns for the years in which refunds were claimed; and that, in any case, upon equitable principles, the petitioner was not entitled to recover the overpayments for those years, since they were less in amount than the tax which should have been assessed against him for 1928. See Stone v. White, \n301 \nU.S. 532\n, 57 S.Ct. 851. The \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n trial court overruled these contentions, and gave judgment for petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that petitioner was not in equity and good conscience entitled to recover the overpayments which, because of his failure to pay the 1928 tax, had resulted in no unjust enrichment of the government. 86 F.(2d) 231. We granted certiorari, \n300 \nU.S. 652\n, 57 S.Ct. 752, because of the importance of the question in administration of the revenue laws.\n The collector does not press here the contention that petitioner is estopped to challenge the correctness of his returns for the years of overpayment. The failure of the government to assess the appropriate tax in 1928 is not shown to be attributable to the erroneous statements made in the returns for the later years, and it is not necessary for petitioner to show understatement of the income taxable in 1928 in order to show the correct amount of the different income derived from the installment contract in the years of overpayment. For, under section 113, the overpayments are established by showing that in each year the amount of income from the sale of the stock as reported exceeded the difference between the installments collected and so much of the value of the installment contract at the death as is allocable to the taxable year. But respondent insists, as the court below held, that petitioner is not equitably entitled to recover overpayments of taxes upon the profits derived from the contract in certain years because the overpayments are exceeded by a tax which he should have paid on the profits realized in an earlier year.\n We may assume that, in the circumstances, equitable principles would preclude recovery in the absence of any statutory provision requiring a different result. But Congress has set limits to the extent to which courts might otherwise go in curtailing a recovery of overpay- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n ments of taxes because of the taxpayer's failure to pay other taxes which might have been but were not assessed against him. Section 607 of the 1928 act (26 U.S.C.A.  1670(a)(2) declares that any payment of a tax after expiration of the period of limitation shall be considered an overpayment, and directs that it be 'credited or refunded to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed within the period of limitation for filing such claim;' and section 609(a) of the 1928 act (26 U.S.C.A.  1675(a) provides that 'any credit against a liability in respect of any taxable year shall be void if any payment in respect of such liability would be considered an overpayment under section 607 (1670(a)(2)).' These provisions preclude the government from taking any benefit from the taxpayer's overpayment by crediting it against an unpaid tax whose collection has been barred by limitation.\n It is plain that these provisions forbid credit of the overpayments of taxes for 1930 and 1931, which were made after collection of the 1928 tax was barred. If petitioner had then paid the 1928 tax, there would have been an overpayment of the tax, refund of which is made mandatory by section 607. Credits against the tax of overpayments of taxes assessed for other years, if made at that time, could not stand on any different footing under the provisions of section 609 (26 U.S.C.A.  1675). The right of the government to credit the overpayments upon the earlier unpaid tax could arise only when the overpayments occurred; but since at that time collection of the 1928 tax was barred by limitation, and payment of it would be an overpayment, credit against it of the 1930 and 1931 overpayments was forbidden by section 609.\n Different considerations apply to the 1929 overpayment. When it was made, collection of the 1928 tax was not barred and the Commissioner was not then prevented by section 609 from crediting the overpayment upon the 1928 tax, although he did not do so. Section 322 of the 1928 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n act,2 continued without material change in the 1932 act (26 U.S.C.A.  322 and note), authorizes the credit of an overpayment of any tax against any income tax 'then due' from the taxpayer, and directs that any 'balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.' We need not inquire whether the 1928 deficiency was 'due' within the meaning of this section before the tax was assessed, for in any case there could be no credit against the tax of the 1929 overpayment, before the amount of the latter was ascertained and allowed and at that time collection of the 1928 tax was barred and any credit of the overpayment against it was declared to be void by section 609.\n Both section 322 and section 609 contemplate that the time of credit of an overpayment in one year against a tax for another is to be marked by some definite administrative action. This Court, upon an examination of the established practice in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, concluded that the time of allowance of a refund and the time of credit of an overpayment against a tax due, is the date of approval by the Commissioner of the schedule of refunds and credits prepared by the collector, showing the amount due the taxpayer, rather than the earlier date of the certification by the Commissioner to the collector, of the schedule of overassessments. See United States v. Swift & Company, \n282 \nU.S. 468\n, 51 S.Ct. 202; Girard Trust Company v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163\n, 46 S.Ct. 229. We accordingly held that approval of the schedule of refunds and credits fixes the date from which interest is allowed upon any balance refunded to the taxpayer, Girard Trust Company v. United States, supra, and the date from which the statute of lim- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n itations runs against the taxpayer's right to demand refund of a tax paid by the allowance of a credit. United States v. Swift & Company, supra.\n After these decisions section 1104 of the Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 287 (26 U.S.C.A.  1670(3), changed the date which should be deemed to be the time of allowance of the credit or refund within the meaning of that and earlier revenue laws. It provided that: 'Where the Commissioner has (before or after the enactment of this Act (June 6, 1932)) signed a schedule of overassessments in respect of any internal revenue tax imposed by this Act (the Revenue Act of 1932), or any prior revenue Act, the date on which he first signed such schedule (if after May 28, 1928) shall be considered as the date of allowance of refund or credit in respect of such tax.'\n The date of the claim for refund and the date of the allowance of the credit which, according to section 1104, was that of the approval by the Commissioner of the schedule of overassessments, came after recovery of the 1928 tax was barred. If petitioner had then paid the tax he could have recovered it back as an overpayment under section 607; accordingly, credit against the tax of the 1929 overpayment is prohibited by section 609, as are like credits for the overpayments of 1930 and 1931.\n The similar treatment accorded by the statutes to credit against an overdue tax, and to payment of it; the prohibition of credit of an overpayment of one year against a barred deficiency for another; and the requirement that payment of a barred deficiency shall be refunded, are controlling evidences of the congressional purpose by the enactment of sections 607 and 609 to require refund to the taxpayer of an overpayment, even though he has failed to pay taxes for other periods, whenever their collection is barred by limitation.\n Sections 607 and 609 do not apply in the circumstances disclosed in Stone v. White, supra. There testamentary trustees had paid from income a tax upon it which should have been paid by the beneficiary, and it was held that \n\n[302 \nU.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n they were not equitably entitled to recover the tax after the statute had barred collection from the beneficiary. The assessment of a deficiency against the trustees and the payment of it by them were not barred by limitation. Hence section 607 did not compel a recovery. Section 609 did not require it. The Commissioner neither sought, nor did section 322, regardless of any period of limitation, permit him to credit the amount which the one taxpayer had paid against the tax which another should have paid. Equitable considerations not within the reach of the statutes denied a recovery. It was enough, in the peculiar facts of the case, that the trustees had suffered no burden and that the government was not unjustly enriched.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 44 (45 Stat. 806, 26 U.S.C.A.  44 and note).

Turner Butler, of Jacksonville, Fla., and George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. J. Compton French, of Tallahassee, Fla., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the National Bank Enabling Amendment of June 25, 1930 (12 U.S.C.A.  90), which granted power to national banks to secure deposits of public funds, validates or makes deposits of public funds, validates or makes enforceable previous pledge agreements made to protect such funds deposited before the enabling amendment became effective. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n That Enabling Act1 provides:\n'Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof, give security for the safekeeping and prompt payment of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State.'\n\n Before and at the time this Enabling Amendment was passed, the laws of Florida authorized state banks to give security for public deposits and also imposed upon public officials a duty to obtain such security. \n2\n In 1929 and 1930, before the passage of this amendment, the First National Bank of Perry, Fla., by agreement with the officials of Taylor County, Fla ., pledged collateral security for the protection of county funds thereafter to be deposited from time to time in the bank.\n This contractual relationship, established by the pledge agreement and deposits made thereunder, continued to exist until the bank was closed October 18, 1930. The receiver for the closed bank at first recognized the pledge agreement as valid and enforceable and accordingly paid the county the income he received from the pledged securities. In 1935, however, the receiver filed this suit in equity in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida, alleging that the pledge agreement was ultra vires and illegal and praying that it be canceled and annulled. Upon motion of the county, the District Court dismissed the bill. Ross v. Knott, 13 F.Supp. 963. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 87 F.2d 817. This Court granted certiorari. \n301 \nU.S. 677\n, 57 S. Ct. 930\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n The issues raised require that we determine:\n\n\n (1)\n Did Congress intend to validate existing ultra vires pledges?\n\n\n (2)\n Could this pledge agreement be validated by changing the law which was in force when the transaction was initiated?\n First. The language of the amendment, read in the light of the conditions that brought about the necessity for its passage, leads irresistibly to the conclusion that Congress did intend to make existing pledges enforceable.\n The amendment does not expressly exclude existing contracts from its field of operation. On the contrary it extended a general grant of the broad power to give security for public deposits, with a single limitation relating to the kind of security given by state banks. If Congress had desired to limit the remedial grant to subsequent security contracts, it would doubtless have provided an additional limitation relating to prior agreements. This it did not do. Congress alone had the power to write such a limitation in the bill. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Agreements to secure public deposits did not violate any express statutory prohibition; no statute imposed a penalty for making such agreements. Since the banking act of 1863 Congress has passed many laws requiring that security be given to protect deposits of certain public funds. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n For many years Comptrollers of the Currency assumed that national banks had power to give security for public deposits and approved the practice of the banks in pledging such security. It has been, and is now, the policy of most states to require security for public funds whether deposited in state or national banks. The \n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n weight of judicial authority in the state courts has supported the doctrine that banks could pledge security for public deposits, but not for private deposits. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency which made a favorable report on the Enabling Amendment gave information to the Senate in its report that millions of dollars worth of collateral had been pledged by national banks as security for public deposits. \n6\n The Senate and House Committee reports show that the sponsors of the amendment desired it not merely to permit future pledges but also to assure that agreements under which 'millions of dollars' of pledges had been made by national banks would be enforceable. One of the chief reasons for the enactment of the amendment was the need for validation of pledges already made. The amendment was designed to meet this need. To determine that Congress did not intend to validate pledge agreements existing when the amendment was passed would greatly limit its curative effect. Such a construction would be an unwarranted departure from the plain intent of this curative and enabling statute.\n Second. Appellant insists that the contract could not be validated by changing the law which was in force when the pledge agreement was made.\n There is nothing novel or extraordinary in the passage of laws by the federal government and the States ratifying, confirming, validating, or curing defective contracts. Such statutes, usually designated as 'remedial,' 'curative,' or 'enabling,' merely remove legal obstacles and permit parties to carry out their contracts according to their own desires and intentions. Such statutes have validated transactions that were previously illegal relat- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n ing to mortgages, deeds, bonds, and other contracts. \n7\n Placing the stamp of legality on a contract voluntarily and fairly entered into by parties for their mutual advantage takes nothing away from either of them. No party who has made an illegal contract has a right to insist that it remain permanently illegal. Public policy cannot be made static by those who, for reasons of their own, make contracts beyond their legal powers. No person has a vested right to be permitted to evade contracts which he has illegally made. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n This Court held that the Enabling Amendment removed the obstacle that prevented the enforcement of a contract of a national bank to give security to the State of Georgia for its deposits. \n9\n In that case as in this case, the bank made an ultra vires agreement to secure public deposits. In that case the deposits were made after the law was passed and were legal. In this case the deposits were made before the law was passed and were legal. In that case as in this case, the only illegal element of the agreement was the attempt to give security for public deposits. In that case as in this case, the parties permitted the original illegal security agreement to remain unaltered in its terms after the amendment was enacted. In that case it was held that the security agreement- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n originally ultra vires-became enforceable from the date the amendment became effective. In this case, we hold that the security agreement- originally ultra vires-became enforceable from the date the amendment became effective. Let the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, concurring.\n The challenged judgment, I think, should be affirmed upon the theory that, subsequent to the enabling amendment of June 25, 1930, both parties recognized an existing obligation to observe the terms of the pledge agreement, and on this understanding maintained the relationship of debtor and creditor. Discussion of other questions seems unnecessary.\n Prior to June 25, 1930, the Perry National Bank obtained deposits of public funds by undertaking to hypothecate certain of its assets to secure their payment. This went beyond the corporate power theretofore conferred. Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416; City of Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421; Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Company, \n292 \nU.S. 559\n, 54 S.Ct. 848, 92 A.L.R. 794.\n The amendment empowered the bank to secure such deposits by a pledge of assets. For more than three months thereafter the securities originally hypothecated were allowed to remain in the keeping of the trustee without suggestion of change in the outstanding agreement. And during that period prior deposits were allowed to remain with the bank. It closed October 18, 1930. Earlier insolvency is not relied upon.\n The receiver claims that as the hypothecation was unlawful when made he became entitled to the assets free of lien.\n After the amendment the bank had full power to do what it had undertaken to do. For three months it \n\n[302 \nU.S. 369, 375]\n\u00a0\n accepted the benefits of the agreement and allowed the assets to remain with the trustee. All parties assumed the validity of the arrangement and acted in reliance upon it. The result was the same as if the assets had been repossessed by the bank after June 25, 1930, and again hypothecated under an agreement identical with the original one. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 604, 46 Stat. 809, 12 U.S.C.  90 (12 U.S.C.A.  90). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] First American Bank & Trust Co. v.

Whitney, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner's claim, under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S.C.A.  207), for injury due to the rejection of a lease by the respondent trustee, was denied by the District Court, and its action was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals1\n * Rehearing denied \n299 \nU.S. 624\n, 57 S.Ct. 321, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[299 U.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n upon a ground similar to that upon which it based its decision in Schwartz v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 456\n, 57 S.Ct. 303.\n In 1922 the petitioner leased premises in Lincoln, Nebraska, to the United Company for ninety-nine years. The lessee agreed to pay an annual rent, taxes and insurance, and by July 1, 1942, to demolish the existing building and erect a new four-story structure. When in August, 1932, the United Company was adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt it was occupying a store on the demised premises and subletting the remaining space. The trustee obtained leave of court either to reject the lease or to assign it to the petitioner or her nominee. The petitioner elected to have it assigned to a nominee and this was done by agreement dated in December, 1932, in which the United Company joined. The petitioner made a new lease to her nominee for a shorter term and at a reduced rental and with no obligation for replacement of the existing building. The agreement between the landlord on the one hand, and the trustee and the bankrupt on the other, provided for the turning over to the landlord's assignee the subleases, the rents which had accrued or would accrue thereunder from the date of the adjudication, and the insurance. The petitioner agreed to assume all existing and future obligations of the United Company under the lease and released the trustee, the bankrupt, and the bankrupt estate, from all claims with respect to the lease except that petitioner did not waive 'the right to prove against the bankrupt estate any provable claims to which the bankruptcy court may adjudge the landlord is entitled.' In the bankruptcy proceeding the petitioner filed claims for taxes and cost of repairs, liability for which had accrued prior to the bankruptcy, for inliquidated damages resulting from loss of future rent and from anticipatory breach of the covenant to build in 1942. After the institution of a 77B pro- \n\n[299 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n ceeding by the United Company the petitioner refiled the same claims therein. The items for accrued taxes and cost of repairs are not in dispute. The trustee objected to the claim for loss of future rent and for anticipatory breach of the covenant to build in 1942. A special master recommended the allowance of the amount of the taxes and repairs and the disallowance of the balance of the claim. Upon appeal, a majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals held that although the trustee had decided to reject the lease and had filed a petition for leave so to do, or to assign, as the claimant had elected to have the lease assigned and had accepted surrender of the premises by requesting assignment to her nominee without reserving any rights under the lease against the debtor, there was no basis under section 77B for allowance of the claim. One judge concurred, holding that the qualification of the release left the way open for proof of any claim permitted by the lease itself and the provisions of 77B, but that no claim for future rent could be sustained because of a provision in the lease to the effect that, if default should occur, transfer of the lessee's interest in the demised premises together with all improvements thereon, all rents, issues, and profits accrued or to accrue, and all insurance policies upon the buildings and improvements, without compensation therefor to the lessee should constitute full satisfaction of the lessor's rights under the lease and the transfer thereof should not be considered as a penalty but as liquidating the damages suffered by the termination of the lease. We think that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right for the reasons stated in the concurring opinion.\n But for the clause stipulating that a transfer by the tenant to the landlord of the demised premises and other things mentioned should terminate the tenant's liability under the lease, the petitioner would have had a provable \n\n[299 U.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n claim. \n2\n The surrender of the premises by the trustee, the acceptance thereof, and the assignment of the lease to a new tenant nominated by the petitioner, whatever may have been their effect under state law, would not bar any claim which she had by force of section 77B for injury due to the trustee's rejection of the lease. \n3\n The landlord's release would likewise have been ineffective to prevent the proving of a claim for injury due to the rejection since the reservation in it was broad enough to save any claim provable under the section. \n4\n The petitioner would, therefore, have had a provable claim except for the terms of her own lease contract by which she had stipulated that, upon termination of the lease, the transfer of the demised premises and certain other things to her, all of which admittedly were transferred to her nominee upon the trustee's rejection of the lease, should be full satisfaction of any damage due to the lessee's default. We have held in Schwartz et al. v. Irving Trust Company, \n299 \nU.S. 456\n, 57 S.Ct. 303, decided this day, that a landlord is bound by his release of the tenant and the trustee for a consideration moving to him, and it is immaterial whether such a release be executed after default or constitute a part of the lease contract. The decree is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In re United Cigar Stores Co. of America, 83 F.(2d) 207. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] City Bank Farmers Trust Company v.

Ludwick Graves and Irvin Fane, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellee.\n\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The questions for decision are whether, as construed in this case by the highest court of Missouri, the statutes of that State regulating public utilities violate article 1,  10 of the Constitution of the United States, declaring that 'No State shall * * * pass any * * * Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts,' or section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment declaring 'nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'\n  Appellee was plaintiff and appellant defendant below. They made a contract whereby the former for specified rates agreed to furnish the latter steam for heating its buildings in Kansas City for a term of five years ending \n\n[300 \nU.S. 109\n, 111]\n\u00a0\n August 31, 1913, with option to defendant to extend the contract for an additional five years. March 17, 1913, the state public service commission law was enacted. 1 May 29, following, defendant exercised its option and so extended the term of the contract to August 31, 1918.\n  June 28, 1917, plaintiff in pursuance of the statute2 filed with the commission a schedule of steam heating rates to become effective August 1, 1917; they were higher than those specified in the contract. The city and numerous users other than defendant objected; the commission, without attempting to apportion operating expenses and values between plaintiff's heating and electric service, found that the rates filed were unreasonably high and prescribed, as just and reasonable, rates lower than those filed but higher than the contract rates and made them effective March 1, 1918. 5 Mo.P.S.C. 664. Plaintiff filed a new schedule in accordance with the commission's order.\n  June 11, 1918, it complained that these rates were confiscatory. The commission, after apportioning operating expenses and values between the electrical and steam services, found the rates 'inadequate, unjust and unreasonably low,' that during none of the time was 'heating revenue sufficient to even meet the fuel expense alone,' and that 'heretofore the steam heating business has been carried at a loss, and this loss has been borne either by the light and power consumers or by the company.' Thereupon, it ordered new and higher rates effective December 1, 1919. 8 Mo.P.S.C. 223, 292, 296. The findings and order of the commission were approved by the supreme court in State ex rel. Case v. Public Serv. Comm., 298 Mo. 303, 249 S.W. 955.\n  For steam furnished defendant after August 1, 1917, plaintiff regularly sent bills based on the rates it had \n\n[300 \nU.S. 109\n, 112]\n\u00a0\n filed with the commission. Claiming the contract rates still to be applicable, defendant paid amounts calculated in accordance with them. Plaintiff gave defendant credit for the payments it made. After expiration of the period covered by the contract as extended, plaintiff brought this suit. For steam furnished after August 1, 1917, and before March 1, 1918, it sought to recover on the basis of the charges specified in the first schedule filed. For steam furnished after March 1, 1918, to the end of the contract term, it sought to recover on the basis of charges of the schedule promulgated by the commission. The trial court held plaintiff not entitled to recover on its claim in respect of the first period but gave judgment in its favor in respect of the other one. Both parties appealed. The Missouri supreme court ruled the contract rates not applicable, held plaintiff entitled to recover on its claim in respect of both periods and directed that it have judgment for the sums calculated on the basis of the schedules filed with the commission.\n  Defendant's contention is not that the State lacked power by appropriate action to establish and enforce just and reasonable rates but that, as against the constitutional provisions invoked, the action taken under the public service commission law was not sufficient to abrogate the contract rates.\n  Specifically, its complaints are that the court construed the statute ( 1) to make (a) mere filing of plaintiff's schedule and (b) the later promulgation of a schedule by the commission effective to abrogate the contract rates, and (2) to require that, although the contract was in due time fully performed and defendant prior to the commencement of the suit had paid plaintiff the contract rates, it was bound to pay additional amounts calculated on the basis of the higher rates specified in plaintiff's published schedules. It is upon these grounds that de- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 109\n, 113]\n\u00a0\n fendant contends that the state law violates the quoted clauses of the Constitution.\n  These questions are to be decided upon the construction that the state supreme court put upon the statute. And that law is to be taken as if it declared that rates made in accordance with its provisions shall supersede all existing contract rates. \n3\n There is here involved no question as to the validity of the rates prior to the passage of the statute. Without expression of opinion, we assume that then parties were bound by the contract. But the State has power to annul and supersede rates previously established by contract between utilities and their customers. \n4\n It has power to require service at nondiscriminatory rates, to prohibit service at rates too low to yield the cost rightly attributable to it,5 and to require utilities to publish their rates and to adhere to them. \n6\n Under the challenged statute, defendant had opportunity to support the contract rates and to test before the commission and in the state supreme court- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 109\n, 114]\n\u00a0\n as others did-the validity of the filed schedules. 7 It failed to do so. And it here insists that the contracts could not be abrogated 'without a proper hearing, finding and order of the commission with respect thereto.' It does not, and reasonably it could not, contend that immediate exertion by the legislature of the State's power to prescribe and enforce reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates depends upon or is conditioned by specific adjudication in respect of existing contract rates.$8 It is clear that, as against those specified in the contract here involved, the rates first filed by plaintiff and those promulgated by the commission in accordance with the statute have the same force and effect as if directly prescribed by the legislature. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n  Lacking in merit is defendant's contention that the statute violates the clauses of the Constitution invoked because held by the court to require that, although before this suit the service had been furnished and paid for in accordance with the contract, defendant was bound to pay more. As shown above, the rates specified in the schedules were held applicable from and after their respective effective dates. Defendant was not injured by plaintiff's failure to withhold service or more promptly to sue for the difference between its lawful charges and the amount paid. It cannot derive any advantage from refusal to pay. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n  Plainly, enforcement of the rates in accordance with the statute did not violate either the contract clause of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 109\n, 115]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  Affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 687\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Missouri R.S.1929, c. 33,  5121 et seq.

O'Donnell and William Buchholz, both of Kansas City, Mo ., for petitioners.\n  Mr. Spencer F. Harris, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The power of an appellate court to modify a decree in equity for the benefit of an appellee in the absence of a cross-appeal is here to be admeasured.\n  Morley Construction Company, a petitioner in this Court, made a contract with the United States, acting by the Veterans' Administration Department for the construction of a veterans' hospital at Batavia, New York. In conformity with statute (40 \nU.S.C.  270 (40 \nU.S.C.A.  270)) it gave a bond for the completion of the contract and for the payment of all bills for material and labor, the respondent Maryland Casualty Company signing the bond as surety. During the progress of the work, the contractor found itself in need of a loan of money to enable it to go on. Accordingly a supplementary agreement was made between the contractor and the surety to relieve the situation. By that agreement, dated April 28, 1933, the contractor agreed to deposit in a designated trust company in Buffalo $5,000 to be used in the performance of the work and to deposit in the same account for the same purpose all moneys received from the United States as payments upon the contract. The surety agreed to deposit in the same account $5,000 as a loan to be secured by the contractor's note, and additional moneys sufficient to pay the present and future bills of plasterers, amounting, as the evidence shows, to $5,700. The contractor and the surety were to have joint control \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 188]\n\u00a0\n of the account, and no moneys were to be withdrawn therefrom without the approval of the surety by designated representatives, the approval to be indicated upon the check or draft in writing.\n  Following this supplementary agreement, the contractor went on with the work, and brought it to completion. The surety made the first payment of $5,000 in accordance with its promise but refused to pay the $5,700 owing to the plasterers. In the meantime a series of payments became owing from the Government upon estimates of value in advance of completion and acceptance. Warrants for these payments were forwarded by the Government to the trust company in Buffalo to be placed in the joint account, notice having been given by the contractor to issue them accordingly. However, a different course was followed when the final payment became due. Apparently through inadvertence, the Government sent a warrant for that payment ($59,780.82) to the contractor itself at its office in Kansas City, Missouri. The contractor endorsed the warrant, delivered it to the Merchants Bank of Kansas City, one of the petitioners in this court, and directed the bank to issue a cashier's check for like amount to the order of the contractor's president. The bank made out the check, but held it to await the payment of the warrant, which it deposited in a Federal Reserve Bank to be forwarded, in the usual course of collection, to the Treasury at Washington. Neither check nor warrant has been paid as a consequence of an injunction obtained by the respondent.\n  Upon learning from the Veterans' Administration Department of the transmission of the warrant, the surety began two suits, one in the District of Columbia, where the payment of the warrant was stayed by an injunction, the other the suit at bar. It recounts in its complaint the facts or most of them already stated in this opinion, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 189]\n\u00a0\n adding thereto that outstanding bills for more than $100,000 are covered by its bond. It says that it is entitled to the specific performance of the supplementary agreement and to a decree depositing the warrant in the trust company at Buffalo to be applied upon the joint account. It says also that by reason of the unpaid bills of materialmen and laborers there is a duty on the part of the contractor to exonerate the surety from loss or liability and to apply the warrant to that purpose. Finally, it makes claim to a right of subrogation to the position of the contractor over against the Government, a claim which apparently has been abandoned and will not engage us further. The bill of complaint ends with a prayer for relief appropriate to the several theories of liability put forward by the pleader, the theory of specific performance, the theory of exoneration, and the theory of subrogation. To render the relief effectual, the bank in Kansas City was joined as a defendant.\n  The District Judge held that the surety was not entitled to the specific performance of the agreement, having failed to pay the plasterers and being therefore in default itself. He held, however, that apart from any agreement the contractor was subject to a duty to exonerate the surety from present liabilities. True, there was no purpose on the part of the contractor to divert the proceeds of the warrant from the uses of the contract. As to this the finding is explicit. Even so, a cause of action for exoneration does not include among its elements the presence of a wrongful purpose. Glades County v. Detroit Fidelity Co. (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 449; West Huntsville Cotton Mills Co. v. Alter, 164 Ala. 305, 51 So. 338; Pavarini & Wyne, Inc., v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., 36 App.D.C. 348, Ann.Cas.1912C, 367; Hutchinson Grocer Co. v. Brand, 79 Kan. 340, 99 P. 592. The decree conforms to the findings in its distribution of relief. It adjudges the complainant to be entitled to exoneration but not to specific performance. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 190]\n\u00a0\n The proceeds of the warrant are to be placed in a bank to be chose by the contractor, the deposit to be 'designated as a special trust fund for the payment of bills for labor and material used on the United States Veterans Hospital in Batavia, New York.' No provision is made that the surety, or indeed any one other than the contractor, shall have any control thereof.\n  From that decree the contractor appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. There was no cross-appeal by the surety. The Court of Appeals states in its opinion, 'We are in grave doubt whether exoneration can properly be granted.' Preferring by reason of that doubt to put its decision on some other ground, it concludes that there should be specific performance of the supplementary agreement. It concedes that the surety is in default for failing to live up to the agreement strictly, but it finds that the default was not unconscionable or fraudulent, and that a court of equity in its discretion may overlook an unsubstantial wrong. Recognizing the necessity of modifying the decree if exoneration is to be exchanged for specific performance, the opinion states that 'an injunction against using the moneys except as agreed upon, and an order to place said moneys when received in the joint account and disburse the same in payment of just claims for labor or materials, would meet the requirements and rights of plaintiff and would not be impossible of performance' and that 'a decree alone such lines should be granted by the trial court.' 84 F.(2d) 522, 526. Accordingly, the mandate of the appellate court provides that the cause be remanded to the District Court with directions to modify its decree in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion. We granted certiorari to fix the measure of relief available to a non-appealing suitor.\n  The substitution of specific performance for exoneration at the instance of the surety was not an affirmance \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 191]\n\u00a0\n of the decree below, as if the reasons only had been changed with the decision standing firm. Alike in substance and in form there was a modification of the decree itself, the facts being found anew and differently, the law declared anew and differently, and the relief remodeled and adapted to the new law and the new facts. Without a cross- appeal, an appellee may 'urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.' United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 564. What he may not do in the absence of a cross-appeal is to 'attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below.' Ibid. The rule is inveterate and certain. Canter v. American & Ocean Insurance Co., 3 Pet. 307, 318; Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191, 196; The Maria Martin, 12 Wall. 31, 40, 41; Field v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n194 \nU.S. 618, 621\n; Landram v. Jordan, \n203 \nU.S. 56, 62\n; Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 111\n, 428; Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co. v.

Findings may be revised at the instance of an appellant, if they are against the weight of evidence, where the case is one in equity. This does not mean that they are subject to like revision in behalf of appellees, at all events in circumstances where a revision of the findings carries with it as an incident a revision of the judgment. There is no need at this time to fix the limits of the rule more sharply. 'Where each party appeals each may assign error, but where only one party appeals the other is bound by the decree in the court below, and he cannot assign error in the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 192]\n\u00a0\n appellate court, nor can he be heard if the proceedings in the appeal are correct, except in support of the decree from which the appeal of the other party is taken.' The Maria Martin, supra. *\n  The surety laid claim to relief upon the basis of a contract, and to other relief by force of an equitable doctrine independent of contract. The decree of the District Court rejected the first claim because the contract had been broken, and accepted the second because the breach was then irrelevant. The decree was responsive to the claim that had been accepted, and not to any other. If there was to be specific performance of the contract, the surety, together with the contractor, would control the distribution of the fund, for so the parties had agreed. If there was to be exoneration and nothing more, the contractor or perhaps the court would control the application and the surety would stand aside. Stulz-Sickles Co. v. Fredburn Construction Corporation, 114 N.J.Eq. 475, 478, 169 A. 27, 28, cf. Glades County v. Detroit Fidelity Co., supra; Arant, Suretyship, pp. 318, 319 and cases cited. Exoneration 'does not entitle the surety to custody or control of the fund.' Stulz-Sickles Co. v. Fredburn Construction Corporation, supra. The decision of the Court of Appeals puts an end to this nice adjustment of the relief to the law and of the law to the facts as found. A decree appropriate to exoneration is annulled, and one appropriate to specific performance is given in its place. This is to find the facts anew and differently, for the trial judge \n\n[300 \nU.S. 185\n, 193]\n\u00a0\n had held, at least by implication, that the breach by the surety, viewed in the light of all the circumstances, was something more than unsubstantial. It is to find the law anew and differently, for the trial judge had held that a surety chargeable with such a breach was not entitled to a decree upon the footing of the contract. Even more important, it is to give a new measure of relief, for the trial judge had ruled that the fund was not to be held upon the restrictions stated in the contract, but upon different restrictions orginating in the conscience of the Chancellor. True, the relief proper to the theory accepted at the trial is almost as favorable from the view-point of the protection of the surety as the one adopted on appeal, though distinctly less burdensome from the view- point of the principal. Exoneration is not the same as specific performance, but it is not very different, and may be nearly, if not quite, as good. This is surely not a reason why an appellate court should be at liberty to treat the two as interchangeable. One might as well say that at the instance of a non-appealing plaintiff a judgment for specific performance could be made to take the place of one for the recovery of damages.\n  The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass upon the question, not yet definitively answered, whether relief in the form of a decree for exoneration is proper in the circumstances, and for other proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 687\n, 81 L.Ed. -.[  Morley Const.

Ralph F. Merchant, of Minneapolis, Minn., and Frank W. Dahn, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Maurice M. Moore, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a question of equity pleading in patent suits.\n The suit is for infringement and the question is as to the sufficiency of what is called the 'short' bill of complaint. That is, the bill alleges the issue and ownership of certain patents, of which profert is made, compliance with all the requirements of the statute and rules of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n practice of the Patent Office, and infringement. The bill does not allege compliance with the requirements of R.S.  4886 and 4887, as amended (35 U.S.C.  31, 32 (35 U.S.C.A.  31, 32)), that is, that the invention, of each of the patents in suit, was not known or used by others in this country before the inventor's invention or discovery thereof, was not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country before his invention or discovery, or for more than two years prior to his application, and was not in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to his application, that the invention had not been abandoned, and that no application for foreign patents had been filed more than twelve months prior to the filing of the application in this country.\n The defendant moved for dismissal of the bill of complaint upon the ground of insufficiency of fact to constitute a valid cause of action in equity. Equity Rule 29 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723). The District Court granted the motion and directed dismissal subject to leave to amend and, amendment not having been made, a final decree was entered, which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 86 F.(2d) 77. Because of conflict of decisions in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari. \n300 \nU.S. 646\n, 57 S.Ct. 434, 81 L.Ed. --. See Moeller v. Scranton Glass Co. (C.C.A. 3d) 19 F.(2d) 14, sustaining the 'short' bill, and Ingrassia v. A.C.W. Mfg. Corporation (C.C.A.2d) 24 F.(2d) 703, to the contrary. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the adoption of the Equity Rules in 1912 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723), it was necessary for the plaintiff to allege not only that he was the first, original and sole inventor but also compliance with the negative requirements of R.S.  4886 and 4887. Sullivan v. Redfield, 23 F.Cas. p. 357, No. 13,597; Blessing v. John Trageser Steam Copper Works (C.C.) 34 F. 753; American Graphophone Co. v. National Phonograph Co. (C.C.) 127 F. 349, 350, 351, and cases there cited. The present diversity of opinion has arisen in relation to the true construction of Equity Rule 25 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723), which provides:\n'Hereafter it shall be sufficient that a bill in equity shall contain, in addition to the usual caption:\n\n'First, the full name, when known, of each plaintiff and defendant, and the citizenship and residence of each party. If any party be under any disability that fact shall be stated.\n\n'Second, a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction depends.\n\n'Third, a short and simple statement of the ultimate facts upon which the plaintiff asks relief, omitting any mere statement of evidence.'\n\n The purpose of the Equity Rules was to simplify equity pleading and practice, and with respect to the former to dispense with prolix and redundant averments which had made equity pleading an outstanding example of unnecessary elaboration. The needed improvement in the interest of simplicity and conciseness made the test not what was time-honored in the verbiage of the past but what was essential to set forth the plaintiff's case. His statement was required to be 'short and simple.' The 'ultimate facts' which are to be stated are manifestly distinguished from evidentiary facts. What are these 'ultimate facts'? They are the facts which the plaintiff must prove, the facts 'upon which the plaintiff asks relief,' not the facts which the defendant must prove in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n establishing an affirmative defense. No analysis of Equity Rule 25 can make it other than a requirement that the plaintiff must concisely set forth the ultimate facts which are sufficient to constitute his cause of action.\n This construction is decisive of the present question. In a suit for infringement of a patent it is not a part of the plaintiff's case to negative prior publication or prior use or the other matters to which R.S .  4886 and 4887 refer. These are matters of affirmative defense. As this Court said in Cantrell v. Wallick, \n117 \nU.S. 689, 695\n, 696 S., 6 S.Ct. 970, 974: 'For the grant of letters patent is prima facie evidence that the patentee is the first inventor of the device described in the letters patent, and of its novelty. Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., \n93 \nU.S. 486\n (23 L.Ed. 952); Lehnbeuter v. Holthaus, \n105 \nU.S. 94\n (26 L.Ed. 939).' The issue of the patent is enough to show, until the contrary appears, that all the conditions under which a discovery is patentable in accordance with the statutes have been met. Hence, the burden of proving want of novelty is upon him who avers it. Walker on Patents,  116. Not only is the burden to make good this defense upon the party setting it up, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held that 'every reasonable doubt should be resolved against him.' Id., Cantrell v. Wallick, supra; Coffin v. Ogden, 18 Wall. 120, 124; The Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 285 S., 12 S.Ct. 443; Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S.Ct. 169. What must be so completely established by the defendant cannot be regarded as a part of the plaintiff's case which is to be set forth in his bill under the Equity Rule.\n The argument is advanced that it may be salutary as a practical matter to compel the plaintiff to negative affirmative defenses under R.S .  4886 and 4887, as it may sometimes happen that he may not be able to make oath to that effect. A similar requirement as to possible affirmative defenses might prove to be advantageous to a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n defendant in other suits than those for patent infringement, but that possibility of benefit does not justify a departure from the standards of correct pleading. There is nothing in the Equity Rule which indicates an intention to preserve the anomalous practice of compelling a plaintiff in a patent suit to allege what he is not required to prove in order to establish his case.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For the diverse rulings of District Courts, see Zenith Carburetor Co. v. Stromberg Motor Devices Co.

The proceeding was instituted by the Beaver Valley Lodge No. 200, affiliated with the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers of America, a labor organization. The unfair labor practices charged were that the corporation was discriminating against members of the union with regard to hire and tenure of employment, and was coercing and intimidating its enployees in order to interfere with their self-organization. The discriminatory and coercive action alleged was the discharge of certain employees.\n The National Labor Relations Board, sustaining the charge, ordered the corporation to cease and desist from such discrimination and coercion, to offer reinstatement to ten of the employees named, to make good their losses in pay, and to post for thirty days notices that the corporation would not discharge or discriminate against members, or those desiring to become members, of the labor union.

Section 2 (29 U.S.C.A.  152). It creates the National Labor Relations Board and prescribes its organization. Sections 3- 6 (29 U.S.C.A.  153-156). It sets forth the right of employees to self- organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. Section 7 (29 U.S.C.A.  157). It defines 'unfair labor practices.' Section 8 (29 U.S.C.A.  158). It lays down rules as to the representation of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining. Section 9 (29 U.S.C.A.  159). The Board is empowered to prevent the described unfair labor practices affecting commerce and the act prescribes the procedure to that end. The Board is authorized to petition designated courts to secure the enforcement of its order. The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, are to be conclusive. If either party on application to the court shows that additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearings before the Board, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken. Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review in the designated courts with the same procedure as in the case of an application by the Board for the enforcement of its order. Section 10 (29 U.S.C.A.  160). The Board has broad powers of investigation. Section 11 (29 U.S.C.A.  161). Interference with members of the Board or its agents in the performance of their duties is punishable by fine and imprisonment. Section 12 (29 U.S.C. A.  162). Nothing in the act is to be construed to interfere with the right to strike. Section 13 (29 U.S.C.A.  163). There is a separability clause to the effect that, if any provision of the act or its application to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, the remainder of the act or its application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. Section 15 (29 U.S.C.A.  165). The particular provisions which are involved in the instant case will be considered more in detail in the course of the discussion.\n The procedure in the instant case followed the statute. The labor union filed with the Board its verified charge. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n The Board thereupon issued its complaint against the respondent, alleging that its action in discharging the employees in question constituted unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of section 8, subdivisions (1) and (3), and section 2, subdivisions (6) and (7), of the act. Respondent, appearing specially for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the Board, filed its answer. Respondent admitted the discharges, but alleged that they were made because of inefficiency or violation of rules or for other good reasons and were not ascribable to union membership or activities. As an affirmative defense respondent challenged the constitutional validity of the statute and its applicability in the instant case. Notice of hearing was given and respondent appeared by counsel. The Board first took up the issue of jurisdiction and evidence was presented by both the Board and the respondent. Respondent then moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and, on denial of that motion, respondent in accordance with its special appearance withdrew from further participation in the hearing. The Board received evidence upon the merits and at its close made its findings and order.\n Contesting the ruling of the Board, the respondent argues (1) that the act is in reality a regulation of labor relations and not of interstate commerce; (2) that the act can have no application to the respondent's relations with its production employees because they are not subject to regulation by the federal government; and (3) that the provisions of the act violate section 2 of article 3 and the Fifth and Seventh Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n The facts as to the nature and scope of the business of the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation have been found by the Labor Board, and, so far as they are essential to the determination of this controversy, they are not in dispute. The Labor Board has found: The corporation is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and has its principal office at Pittsburgh. It is engaged in the business of manufacturing iron and steel in plants situated in Pittsburgh and nearby Aliquippa, Pa. It manufactures and distributes a widely diversified line of steel and pig iron, being the fourth largest producer of steel in the United States. With its subsidiaries-nineteen in number-it is a completely integrated enterprise, owning and operating ore, coal and limestone properties, lake and river transportation facilities and terminal railroads located at its manufacturing plants. It owns or controls mines in Michigan and Minnesota. It operates four ore steamships on the Great Lakes, used in the transportation of ore to its factories. It owns coal mines in Pennsylvania. It operates towboats and steam barges used in carrying coal to its factories. It owns limestone properties in various places in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It owns the Monongahela connecting railroad which connects the plants of the Pittsburgh works and forms an interconnection with the Pennsylvania, New York Central and Baltimore & Ohio Railroad systems. It owns the Aliquippa & Southern Railroad Company, which connects the Aliquippa works with the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie, part of the New York Central system. Much of its product is shipped to its warehouses in Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and Memphis,-to the last two places by means of its own barges and transportation equipment. In Long Island City, New York, and in New Orleans it operates structural steel fabricating shops in connection with the warehousing of semifinished materials sent from its works. Through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries it owns, leases, and operates stores, warehouses, and yards for the distribution of equipment and supplies for drilling and operating oil and gas wells and for pipe lines, refineries and pumping stations. It has sales offices in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n twenty cities in the United States and a wholly-owned subsidiary which is devoted exclusively to distributing its product in Canada. Approximately 75 per cent. of its product is shipped out of Pennsylvania.\n Summarizing these operations, the Labor Board concluded that the works in Pittsburgh and Aliquippa 'might be likened to the heart of a self- contained, highly integrated body. They draw in the raw materials from Michigan, Minnesota, West Virginia, Pennsylvania in part through arteries and by means controlled by the respondent; they transform the materials and then pump them out to all parts of the nation through the vast mechanism which the respondent has elaborated.'\n To carry on the activities of the entire steel industry, 33,000 men mine ore, 44,000 men mine coal, 4,000 men quarry limestone, 16,000 men manufacture coke, 343,000 men manufacture steel, and 83,000 men transport its product. Respondent has about 10,000 employees in its Aliquippa plant, which is located in a community of about 30,000 persons.\n Respondent points to evidence that the Aliquippa plant, in which the discharged, men were employed, contains complete facilities for the production of finished and semifinished iron and steel products from raw materials; that its works consist primarily of a by-product coke plant for the production of coke; blast furnaces for the production of pig iron; open hearth furnaces and Bessemer converters for the production of steel; blooming mills for the reduction of steel ingots into smaller shapes; and a number of finishing mills such as structural mills, rod mills, wire mills, and the like. In addition, there are other buildings, structures and equipment, storage yards, docks and an intraplant storage system. Respondent's operations at these works are carried on in two distinct stages, the first being the conversion of raw materials into pig \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n iron and the second being the manufacture of semifinished and finished iron and steel products; and in both cases the operations result in substantially changing the character, utility and value of the materials wrought upon, which is apparent from the nature and extent of the processes to which they are subjected and which respondent fully describes. Respondent also directs attention to the fact that the iron ore which is procured from mines in Minnesota and Michigan and transported to respondent's plant is stored in stock piles for future use, the amount of ore in storage varying with the season but usually being enough to maintain operations from nine to ten months; that the coal which is procured from the mines of a subsidiary located in Pennsylvania and taken to the plant at Aliquippa is there, like ore, stored for future use, approximately two to three months' supply of coal being always on hand; and that the limestone which is obtained in Pennsylvania and West Virginia is also stored in amounts usually adequate to run the blast furnaces for a few weeks. Various details of operation, transportation, and distribution are also mentioned which for the present purpose it is not necessary to detail.\n Practically all the factual evidence in the case, except that which dealt with the nature of respondent's business, concerned its relations with the employees in the Aliquippa plant whose discharge was the subject of the complaint. These employees were active leaders in the labor union. Several were officers and others were leaders of particular groups. Two of the employees were motor inspectors; one was a tractor driver; three were crane operators; one was a washer in the coke plant; and three were laborers. Three other employees were mentioned in the complaint but it was withdrawn as to one of them and no evidence was heard on the action taken with respect to the other two. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n While respondent criticizes the evidence and the attitude of the Board, which is described as being hostile toward employers and particularly toward those who insisted upon their constitutional rights, respondent did not take advantage of its opportunity to present evidence to refute that which was offered to show discrimination and coercion. In this situation, the record presents no ground for setting aside the order of the Board so far as the facts pertaining to the circumstances and purpose of the discharge of the employees are concerned. Upon that point it is sufficient to say that the evidence supports the findings of the Board that respondent discharged these men 'because of their union activity and for the purpose of discouraging membership in the union.' We turn to the questions of law which respondent urges in contesting the validity and application of the act.\n First. The Scope of the Act.-The act is challenged in its entirety as an attempt to regulate all industry, thus invading the reserved powers of the States over their local concerns. It is asserted that the references in the act to interstate and foreign commerce are colorable at best; that the act is not a true regulation of such commerce or of matters which directly affect it, but on the contrary has the fundamental object of placing under the compulsory supervision of the federal government all industrial labor relations within the nation. The argument seeks support in the broad words of the preamble (section 13) and in the sweep of the provisions of the act, and it is further insisted that its legislative history shows an essential universal purpose in the light of which its scope cannot be limited by either construction or by the application of the separability clause.\n If this conception of terms, intent and consequent inseparability were sound, the act would necessarily fall \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n by reason of the limitation upon the federal power which inheres in the constitutional grant, as well as because of the explicit reservation of the Tenth Amendment. Schechter Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 549\n, 550 S., 554, 55 S.Ct. 837, 851, 853, 97 A.L.R. 947. The authority of the federal government may not be pushed to such an extreme as to destroy the distinction, which the commerce clause itself establishes, between commerce 'among the several States' and the internal concerns of a state. That distinction between what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce is vital to the maintenance of our federal system. Id.\n But we are not at liberty to deny effect to specific provisions, which Congress has constitutional power to enact, by superimposing upon them inferences from general legislative declarations of an ambiguous character, even if found in the same statute. The cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy. We have repeatedly held that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the act. Even to avoid a serious doubt the rule is the same. Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337, 32 A.L.R. 786; Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S.Ct. 391, 395; Missouri Pacific R.R. Co., v. Boone, \n270 \nU.S. 466, 472\n, 46 S.Ct. 341, 343; Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 148, \n276 \nU.S. 594\n, 48 S.Ct. 105, 107; Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 331, 346\n, 48 S.Ct. 194, 198.\n We think it clear that the National Labor Relations Act may be construed so as to operate within the sphere of constitutional authority. The jurisdiction conferred upon the Board, and invoked in this instance, is found in section 10(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a), which provides:\n'Sec. 10(a). The Board is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 8 (section 158)) affecting commerce.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n The critical words of this provision, prescribing the limits of the Board's authority in dealing with the labor practices, are 'affecting commerce.' The act specifically defines the 'commerce' to which it refers ( section 2(6), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(6):\n\n'The term 'commerce' means trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, or between the District of Columbia or any Territory of the United States and any State or other Territory, or between any foreign country and any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or within the District of Columbia or any Territory, or between points in the same State but through any other State or any Territory or the District of Columbia or any foreign country.'\n\n There can be no question that the commerce thus contemplated by the act (aside from that within a Territory or the District of Columbia) is interstate and foreign commerce in the constitutional sense. The act also defines the term 'affecting commerce' section 2(7), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(7):\n'The term 'affecting commerce' means in commerce, or burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce, or having led or tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.'\n\n This definition is one of exclusion as well as inclusion. The grant of authority to the Board does not purport to extend to the relationship between all industrial employees and employers. Its terms do not impose collective bargaining upon all industry regardless of effects upon interstate or foreign commerce. It purports to reach only what may be deemed to burden or obstruct that commerce and, thus qualified, it must be construed as contemplating the exercise of control within constitutional bounds. It is a familiar principle that acts which directly burden or obstruct interstate or foreign commerce, or its free flow, are within the reach of the congressional power. Acts having that effect are not \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n rendered immune because they grow out of labor disputes. See Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway & S.S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 433, 434; Schechter Corporation v. United States, supra, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, at pages 544, 545, 55 S.Ct. 837, 849, 97 A.L.R. 947; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, decided March 29, 1937. It is the effect upon commerce, not the source of the injury, which is the criterion. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co.), \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44. Whether or not particular action does affect commerce in such a close and intimate fashion as to be subject to federal control, and hence to lie within the authority conferred upon the Board, is left by the statute to be determined as individual cases arise. We are thus to inquire whether in the instant case the constitutional boundary has been passed.\n Second. The Unfair Labor Practices in Question.-The unfair labor practices found by the Board are those defined in section 8, subdivisions ( 1) and (3). These provide:\n'Sec. 8. It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer-\n\n'(1) To interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7 (section 157 of this title). ...\n\n'(3) By discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n Section 8, subdivision (1), refers to section 7, which is as follows:\n\n'Section 7. Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.'\n\n Thus, in its present application, the statute goes no further than to safeguard the right of employees to self-organization and to select representatives of their own choosing for collective bargaining or other mutual protection without restraint or coercion by their employer.\n That is a fundamental right. Employees have as clear a right to organize and select their representatives for lawful purposes as the respondent has to organize its business and select its own officers and agents. Discrimination and coercion to prevent the free exercise of the right of employees to self-organization and representation is a proper subject for condemnation by competent legislative authority. Long ago we stated the reason for labor organizations. We said that they were organized out of the necessities of the situation; that a single employee was helpless in dealing with an employer; that he was dependent ordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and family; that, if the employer refused to pay him the wages that he thought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employ and resist arbitrary and unfair treatment; that union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on an equality with their employer. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360. We reiterated these views when we had under consideration the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577. Fully recognizing the legality of collective action on the part of employees in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n order to safeguard their proper interests, we said that Congress was not required to ignore this right but could safeguard it. Congress could seek to make appropriate collective action of employees an instrument of peace rather than of strife. We said that such collective action would be a mockery if representation were made futile by interference with freedom of choice. Hence the prohibition by Congress of interference with the selection of representatives for the purpose of negotiation and conference between employers and employees, 'instead of being an invasion of the constitutional right of either, was based on the recognition of the rights of both.' Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway & S.S. Clerks, supra. We have reasserted the same principle in sustaining the application of the Railway Labor Act as amended in 1934 (45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.). Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation, No. 40, supra.\n Third. The application of the Act to Employees Engaged in Production.- The Principle Involved.-Respondent says that, whatever may be said of employees engaged in interstate commerce, the industrial relations and activities in the manufacturing department of respondent's enterprise are not subject to federal regulation. The argument rests upon the proposition that manufacturing in itself is not commerce. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 21 S., 9 S.Ct. 6; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 407\n, 408 S., 42 S.Ct. 570, 581, 582, 27 A.L.R. 762; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 178\n, 43 S.Ct. 526, 529; United Leather Workers' International Union v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., \n265 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 44 S.Ct. 623, 625, 33 A.L.R. 566; Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 82\n, 45 S.Ct. 403, 407; Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551, 556; Schechter Corporation v. United States, supra, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, at page 547, 55 S.Ct. 837, 850, 97 A.L.R. 947; Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 304\n, 317 S., 327, 56 S.Ct. 855, 869, 875, 880\n\n\n The government distinguishes these cases. The various parts of respondent's enterprise are described as interdependent and as thus involving 'a great movement of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n iron ore, coal and limestone along well-defined paths to the steel mills, thence through them, and thence in the form of steel products into the consuming centers of the country-a definite and well-understood course of business.' It is urged that these activities constitute a 'stream' or 'flow' of commerce, of which the Aliquippa manufacturing plant is the focal point, and that industrial strife at that point would cripple the entire movement. Reference is made to our decision sustaining the Packers and Stockyards Act. \n5\n Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229. The Court found that the stockyards were but a 'throat' through which the current of commerce flowed and the transactions which there occurred could not be separated from that movement. Hence the sales at the stockyards were not regarded as merely local transactions, for, while they created 'a local change of title,' they did not 'stop the flow,' but merely changed the private interests in the subject of the current. Distinguishing the cases which upheld the power of the state to impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon property which the owner intended to transport to another state, but which was not in actual transit and was held within the state subject to the disposition of the owner, the Court remarked: 'The question, it should be observed, is not with respect to the extent of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, but whether a particular exercise of state power in view of its nature and operation must be deemed to be in conflict with this paramount authority.' Id., \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, at page 526, 42 S.Ct. 397, 405, 23 A.L.R. 229. See Minnesota v. Blasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 54 S.Ct. 34, 36. Applying the doctrine of Stafford v. Wallace, supra, the Court sustained the Grain Futures Act of 19226 with respect to transactions on the Chicago Board of Trade, although these transactions were 'not in and of themselves interstate commerce.' Congress had found \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n that they had become 'a constantly recurring burden and obstruction to that commerce.' Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 32\n, 43 S.Ct. 470, 476. Compare Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 69\n, 42 S.Ct. 453, 458. See, also, Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220.\n Respondent contends that the instant case presents material distinctions. Respondent says that the Aliquippa plant is extensive in size and represents a large investment in buildings, machinery and equipment. The raw materials which are brought to the plant are delayed for long periods and, after being subjected to manufacturing processes 'are changed substantially as to character, utility and value.' The finished products which emerge 'are to a large extent manufactured without reference to pre-existing orders and contracts and are entirely different from the raw materials which enter at the other end.' Hence respondent argues that, 'If importation and exportation in interstate commerce do not singly transfer purely local activities into the field of congressional regulation, it should follow that their combination would not alter the local situation.' Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, Southwestern R. Co ., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 151\n, 39 S.Ct. 237; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, supra.\n We do not find it necessary to determine whether these features of defendant's business dispose of the asserted analogy to the 'stream of commerce' cases. The instances in which that metaphor has been used are but particular, and not exclusive, illustrations of the protective power which the government invokes in support of the present act. The congressional authority to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions is not limited to transactions which can be deemed to be an essential part of a 'flow' of interstate or foreign commerce. Burdens and obstructions may be due to injurious action springing from other sources. The fundamental principle is that the power to regulate commerce is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n the power to enact 'all appropriate legislation' for its 'protection or advancement' (The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564); to adopt measures 'to promote its growth and insure its safety' (County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 \nU.S. 691, 696\n, 697 S.); 'to foster, protect, control, and restrain.' (Second Employers' Liability Cases, supra, \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 47, 32 S.Ct. 169, 174, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44). See Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway & S.S. Clerks, supra. That power is plenary and may be exerted to protect interstate commerce 'no matter what the source of the dangers which threaten it.' Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 51, 32 S.Ct. 169, 176, 38 L.R.A.( N.S.) 44; Schechter Corporation v. United States, supra. Although activities may be intrastate in character when separately considered, if they have such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions, Congress cannot be denied the power to exercise that control. Schechter Corporation v. United States, supra. Undoubtedly the scope of this power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government. Id. The question is necessarily one of degree. As the Court said in Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 37, 43 S.Ct. 470, 477, repeating what had been said in Stafford v. Wallace, supra: 'Whatever amounts to more or less constant practice, and threatens to obstruct or unduly to burden the freedom of interstate commerce is within the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause, and it is primarily for Congress to consider and decide the fact of the danger and to meet it.'\n That intrastate activities, by reason of close and intimate relation to interstate commerce, may fall within federal control is demonstrated in the case of carriers who \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n are engaged in both interstate and intrastate transportation. There federal control has been found essential to secure the freedom of interstate traffic from interference or unjust discrimination and to promote the efficiency of the interstate service. The Shreveport Case ( Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. United States), \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 351. 352, 34 S. Ct. 833; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 237, 22 A.L.R. 1086. It is manifest that intrastate rates deal primarily with a local activity. But in rate making they bear such a close relation to interstate rates that effective control of the one must embrace some control over the other. Id. Under the Transportation Act, 1920,7 Congress went so far as to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish a state-wide level of intrastate rates in order to prevent an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q.R.R. Co., supra; Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 210\n, 211 S., 51 S.Ct. 119, 123. Other illustrations are found in the broad requirements of the Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.C.A.  1-10) and the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C.A.  61-64). Southern Railway Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2; Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S.Ct. 621. It is said that this exercise of federal power has relation to the maintenance of adequate instrumentalities of interstate commerce. But the agency is not superior to the commerce which uses it. The protective power extends to the former because it exists as to the latter.\n The close and intimate effect which brings the subject within the reach of federal power may be due to activities in relation to productive industry although the industry when separately viewed is local. This has been abundantly illustrated in the application of the Federal Anti-Trust Act (15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note). In the Standard Oil and American Tobacco Cases (Standard Oil Co. v. United States), \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; (United States v. American Tobacco Co.) \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632), that statute was applied to combinations of employers engaged in productive industry. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the offending corporations strongly urged that the Sherman Act had no application because the acts complained of were not acts of interstate or foreign commerce, nor direct and immediate in their effect on interstate or foreign commerce, but primarily affected manufacturing and not commerce. \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 5, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L. R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, at page 125, 31 S.Ct. 632. Counsel relied upon the decision in United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1\n, 15 S.Ct. 249. The Court stated their contention as follows: 'That the act, even if the averments of the bill be true, cannot be constitutionally applied, because to do so would extend the power of Congress to subject dehors the reach of its authority to regulate commerce, by enabling that body to deal with mere questions of production of commodities within the states.' And the Court summarily dismissed the contention in these words: 'But all the structure upon which this argument proceeds is based upon the decision in United States v. E.C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1\n, 15 S.Ct. 249. The view, however, which the argument takes of that case, and the arguments based upon that view have been so repeatedly pressed upon this court in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of the Anti-trust Act, and have been so necessarily and expressly decided to be unsound as to cause the contentions to be plainly foreclosed and to require no express notice' ( citing cases). \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, at pages 68, 69, 31 S.Ct. 502, 519, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734.\n Upon the same principle, the Anti-Trust Act has been applied to the conduct of employees engaged in production. Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S.Ct. 301, 13 Ann.Cas. 815; Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, supra; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791. See, also, Local 167, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293, 297\n, 54 S.Ct. 396, 398; Schechter Corporation v. United States, supra. The decisions dealing with the question of that application illustrate both the principle and its limitation. Thus, in the first Coronado Case, the Court held that mining was not interstate commerce, that the power of Congress did not extend to its regulation as such, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n and that it had not been shown that the activities there involved-a local strike-brought them within the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act, notwithstanding the broad terms of that statute. A similar conclusion was reached in United Leather Workers' International Union v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., supra, Industrial Association v. United States, supra, and Levering & Garrigues v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 53 S.Ct. 549, 550. But in the first Coronado Case the Court also said that 'if Congress deems certain recurring practices though not really part of interstate commerce, likely to obstruct, restrain or burden it, it has the power to subject them to national supervision and restraint.' \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, at page 408, 42 S.Ct. 570, 582, 27 A.L.R. 762. And in the second Coronado Case the Court ruled that, while the mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture or production is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce, nevertheless when the 'intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act.' \n268 \nU.S. 295\n, at page 310, 45 S.Ct. 551, 556. And the existence of that intent may be a necessary inference from proof of the direct and substantial effect produced by the employees' conduct. Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64\n, at page 81, 45 S.Ct. 403, 407. What was absent from the evidence in the first Coronado Case appeared in the second and the act was accordingly applied to the mining employees.\n It is thus apparent that the fact that the employees here concerned were engaged in production is not determinative. The question remains as to the effect upon interstate commerce of the labor practice involved. In the Schechter Case, supra, we found that the effect there was so remote as to be beyond the federal power. To find 'immediacy or directness' there was to find it 'almost \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n everywhere,' a result inconsistent with the maintenance of our federal system. In the Carter Case, supra, the Court was of the opinion that the provisions of the statute relating to production were invalid upon several grounds,-that there was improper delegation of legislative power, and that the requirements not only went beyond any sustainable measure of protection of interstate commerce but were also inconsistent with due process. These cases are not controlling here.\n Fourth. Effects of the Unfair Labor Practice in Respondent's Enterprise.-Giving full weight to respondent's contention with respect to a break in the complete continuity of the 'stream of commerce' by reason of respondent's manufacturing operations, the fact remains that the stoppage of those operations by industrial strife would have a most serious effect upon interstate commerce. In view of respondent's far-flung activities, it is idle to say that the effect would be indirect or remote. It is obvious that it would be immediate and might be catastrophic. We are asked to shut our eyes to the plainest facts of our national life and to deal with the question of direct and indirect effects in an intellectual vacuum. Because there may be but indirect and remote effects upon interstate commerce in connection with a host of local enterprises throughout the country, it does not follow that other industrial activities do not have such a close and intimate relation to interstate commerce as to make the presence of industrial strife a matter of the most urgent national concern. When industries organize themselves on a national scale, making their relation to interstate commerce the dominant factor in their activities, how can it be maintained that their industrial labor relations constitute a forbidden field into which Congress may not enter when it is necessary to protect interstate commerce from the paralyzing consequences of industrial war? We have often said that interstate commerce itself is a practical \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n conception. It is equally true that interferences with that commerce must be appraised by a judgment that does not ignore actual experience.\n Experience has abundantly demonstrated that the recognition of the right of employees to self-organization and to have representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining is often an essential condition of industrial peace. Refusal to confer and negotiate has been one of the most prolific causes of strife. This is such an outstanding fact in the history of labor disturbances that it is a proper subject of judicial notice and requires no citation of instances. The opinion in the case of Virginia Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, points out that, in the case of carriers, experience has shown that before the amendment, of 1934, of the Railway Labor Act, 'when there was no dispute as to the organizations authorized to represent the employees, and when there was willingness of the employer to meet such representative for a discussion of their grievances, amicable adjustment of differences had generally followed and strikes had been avoided.' That, on the other hand, 'a prolific source of dispute had been the maintenance by the railroads of company unions and the denial by railway management of the authority of representatives chosen by their employees.' The opinion in that case also points to the large measure of success of the labor policy embodied in the Railway Labor Act. But, with respect to the appropriateness of the recognition of self-organization and representation in the promotion of peace, the question is not essentially different in the case of employees in industries of such a character that interstate commerce is put in jeopardy from the case of employees of transportation companies. And of what avail is it to protect the facility of transportation, if interstate commerce is throttled with respect to the commodities to be transported! \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n These questions have frequently engaged the attention of Congress and have been the subject of many inquiries. \n8\n The steel industry is one of the great basic industries of the United States, with ramifying activities affecting interstate commerce at every point. The Government aptly refers to the steel strike of 1919-1920 with its far-reaching consequences. \n9\n The fact that there appears to have been no major disturbance in that industry in the more recent period did not dispose of the possibilities of future and like dangers to interstate commerce which Congress was entitled to foresee and to exercise its protective power to forestall. It is not necessary again to detail the facts as to respondent's enterprise. Instead of being beyond the pale, we think that it presents in a most striking way the close and intimate relation which a manufacturing industry may have to interstate commerce and we have no doubt that Congress had constitutional authority to safeguard the right of respondent's employees to self- organization and freedom in the choice of representatives for collective bargaining.\n Fifth. The Means Which the Act Employs.-Questions under the Due Process Clause and Other Constitutional Restrictions.-Respondent asserts its right to conduct its business in an orderly manner without being subjected to arbitrary restraints. What we have said points to the fallacy in the argument. Employees have their correlative \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n right to organize for the purpose of securing the redress of grievances and to promote agreements with employers relating to rates of pay and conditions of work. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway S.S. Clerks, supra; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40. Restraint for the purpose of preventing an unjust interference with that right cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious. The provision of section 9(a)10 that representatives, for the purpose of collective bargaining, of the majority of the employees in an appropriate unit shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in that unit, imposes upon the respondent only the duty of conferring and negotiating with the authorized representatives of its employees for the purpose of settling a labor dispute. This provision has its analogue in section 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), which was under consideration in Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra. The decree which we affirmed in that case required the railway company to treat with the representative chosen by the employees and also to refrain from entering into collective labor agreements with any one other than their true representative as ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the act. We said that the obligation to treat with the true representative was exclusive and hence imposed the negative duty to treat with no other. We also pointed out that, as conceded by the government,11 the injunc- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n tion against the company's entering into any contract concerning rules, rates of pay and working conditions except with a chosen representative was 'designed only to prevent collective bargaining with any one purporting to represent employees' other than the representative they had selected. It was taken 'to prohibit the negotiation of labor contracts, generally applicable to employees' in the described unit with any other representative than the one so chosen, 'but not as precluding such individual contracts' as the company might 'elect to make directly with individual employees.' We think this construction also applies to section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  159(a).\n The act does not compel agreements between employers and employees. It does not compel any agreement whatever. It does not prevent the employer 'from refusing to make a collective contract and hiring individuals on whatever terms' the employer 'may by unilateral action determine.' \n12\n The act expressly provides in section 9(a) that any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer. The theory of the act is that free opportunity for negotiation with accredited representatives of employees is likely to promote industrial peace and may bring about the adjustments and agreements which the act in itself does not attempt to compel. As we said in Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway & S.S. Clerks, supra, and repeated in Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, the cases of Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161\n, 28 S.Ct. 277, 13 Ann.Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S.Ct. 240, L.R.A.1915C, 960, are inapplicable to legislation of this character. The act does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the employer to select its employees or to discharge them. The employer may not, under cover of that right, intimidate or coerce its employees with respect to their \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n self-organization and representation, and, on the other hand, the Board is not entitled to make its authority a pretext for interference with the right of discharge when that right is exercised for other reasons than such intimidation and coercion. The true purpose is the subject of investigation with full opportunity to show the facts. It would seem that when employers freely recognize the right of their employees to their own organizations and their unrestricted right of representation there will be much less occasion for controversy in respect to the free and appropriate exercise of the right of selection and discharge.\n The act has been criticized as one-sided in its application; that it subjects the employer to supervision and restraint and leaves untouched the abuses for which employees may be responsible; that it fails to provide a more comprehensive plan,-with better assurances of fairness to both sides and with increased chances of success in bringing about, if not compelling, equitable solutions of industrial disputes affecting interstate commerce. But we are dealing with the power of Congress, not with a particular policy or with the extent to which policy should go. We have frequently said that the legislative authority, exerted within its proper field, need not embrace all the evils within its reach. The Constitution does not forbid 'cautious advance, step by step,' in dealing with the evils which are exhibited in activities within the range of legislative power. Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 26 S.Ct. 66; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S.Ct. 856; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, L.R.A.1915F, 829; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 396\n, 52 S.Ct. 581, 588. The question in such cases is whether the Legislature, in what it does prescribe, has gone beyond constitutional limits.\n The procedural provisions of the act are assailed. But these provisions, as we construe them, do not offend against the constitutional requirements governing the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n creation and action of administrative bodies. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185. The act establishes standards to which the Board must conform. There must be complaint, notice and hearing. The Board must receive evidence and make findings. The findings as to the facts are to be conclusive, but only if supported by evidence. The order of the Board is subject to review by the designated court, and only when sustained by the court may the order be enforced. Upon that review all questions of the jurisdiction of the Board and the regularity of its proceedings, all questions of constitutional right or statutory authority are open to examination by the court. We construe the procedural provisions as affording adequate opportunity to secure judicial protection against arbitrary action in accordance with the well-settled rules applicable to administrative agencies set up by Congress to aid in the enforcement of valid legislation. It is not necessary to repeat these rules which have frequently been declared. None of them appears to have been transgressed in the instant case. Respondent was notified and heard. It had opportunity to meet the charge of unfair labor practices upon the merits, and by withdrawing from the hearing it declined to avail itself of that opportunity. The facts found by the Board support its order and the evidence supports the findings. Respondent has no just ground for complaint on this score.\n The order of the Board required the reinstatement of the employees who were found to have been discharged because of their 'union activity' and for the purpose of 'discouraging membership in the union.' That requirement was authorized by the act. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c). In Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Railway & S.S. Clerks, supra, a similar order for restoration to service was made by the court in contempt proceedings for the violation of an injunction issued by the court to restrain an interference with \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n the right of employees as guaranteed by the Railway Labor Act of 1926. The requirement of restoration to service of employees discharged in violation of the provisions of that act was thus a sanction imposed in the enforcement of a judicial decree. We do not doubt that Congress could impose a like sanction for the enforcement of its valid regulation. The fact that in the one case it was a judicial sanction, and in the other a legislative one, is not an essential difference in determining its propriety.\n Respondent complaints that the Board not only ordered reinstatement but directed the payment of wages for the time lost by the discharge, less amounts earned by the employee during that period. This part of the order was also authorized by the act. Section 10(c). It is argued that the requirement is equivalent to a money judgment and hence contravenes the Seventh Amendment with respect to trial by jury. The Seventh Amendment provides that 'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars; the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.' The amendment thus preserves the right which existed under the common law when the amendment was adopted. Shields v. Thomas, 18 How. 253, 262; In re Wood, \n210 \nU.S. 246, 258\n, 28 S.Ct. 621; Dimick v. Schiedt, \n293 \nU.S. 474, 476\n, 55 S.Ct. 296, 95 A.L.R. 1150; Baltimore & Carolina Line v. Redman, \n295 \nU.S. 654, 657\n, 55 S.Ct. 890, 891. Thus it has no application to cases where recovery of money damages is an incident to equitable relief even though damages might have been recovered in an action at law. Clark v. Wooster, \n119 \nU.S. 322, 325\n, 7 S.Ct. 217; Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., \n243 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 37 S.Ct. 283, Ann.Cas.1918C, 1147. It does not apply where the proceeding is not in the nature of a suit at common law. Guthrie National Bank v. Guthrie, \n173 \nU.S. 528, 537\n, 19 S.Ct. 513.\n The instant case is not a suit at common law or in the nature of such a suit. The proceeding is one unknown to the common law. It is a statutory proceeding. Reinstatement of the employee and payment for time lost are \n\n[301 \nU.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n requirements imposed for violation of the statute and are remedies appropriate to its enforcement. The contention under the Seventh Amendment is without merit.\n Our conclusion is that the order of the Board was within its competency and that the act is valid as here applied. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 5, 1935, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq. (29 U.S. C.A.  151 et seq.). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This section is as follows:\n'Section 1. The denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.\n\n'The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.\n\n'Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.\n\n'It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.' 29 U.S. C.A.  151. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 2. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] What is quoted above is followed by this proviso-not here involved-' Provided, That nothing in this Act (chapter), or in the National Industrial Recovery Act (U.S.C., Supp. VII, title 15, Secs. 701-712), as amended from time to time (sections 701 to 712 of Title 15), or in any code or agreement approved or prescribed thereunder, or in any other statute of the United States, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in this Act (chapter) as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the employees as provided in section 9(a) (section 159(a) of this title), in the appropriate collective bargaining unit covered by such agreement when made.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 42 Stat. 159 (7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq.). \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 42 Stat. 998 (7 U.S.C.A.  1-17). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Sections 416, 422, 41 Stat. 484, 488 (49 U.S.C.A.  13, 15a); Interstate Commerce Act,  13(4), 49 U.S.C.A.  13(4). \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See, for example, Final Report of the Industrial Commission (1902), vol. 19, p. 844; Report of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission (1902), Sen.Doc.

UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 190\nArgued: November 15, 1937Decided: December 20, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Halle, of New York City, and Thomas O'Rourke Gallagher, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. W. Barron, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The importance of the question involved-whether, in view of the provisions of section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934,1 evidence procured by a federal officer's tapping telephone wires and intercepting messages is admissible in a criminal trial in a United States District Court-moved us to grant the writ of certiorari.\n The indictment under which the petitioners were tried, convicted, and sentenced, charged, in separate counts, the smuggling of alcohol, possession and concealment of the smuggled alcohol, and conspiracy to smuggle and conceal it. Over the petitioners' objection and exception federal agents testified to the substance of petitioners' interstate communications overheard by the witnesses who had intercepted the messages be tapping telephone wires. The court below, though it found this evidence constituted such a vital part of the prosecution's proof that its admission, if erroneous, amounted to reversible error, held it was properly admitted and affirmed the judgment of conviction. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act provides that no person who, as an employe, has to do with the sending or receiving of any interstate communication \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n by wire shall divulge or publish it or its substance to anyone other than the addressee or his authorized representative or to authorized fellow employes, save in response to a subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or on demand of other lawful authority; and 'no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.'\n Section 5013 penalizes wilful and knowing violation by fine and imprisonment.\n Taken at face value the phrase 'no person' comprehends federal agents, and the ban on communication to 'any person' bars testimony to the content of an intercepted message. Such an application of the section is supported by comparison of the clause concerning intercepted messages with that relating to those known to employes of the carrier. The former may not be divulged to any person, the latter may be divulged in answer to a lawful subpoena.\n The government contends that Congress did not intend to prohibit tapping wires to procure evidence. It is said that this court, in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438\n, 48 S.Ct. 564, 66 A.L.R. 376, held such evidence admissible at common law despite the fact that a state statute made wire-tapping a crime; and the argument proceeds that since the Olmstead decision departments of the federal government, with the knowledge of Congress, have, to a limited extent, permitted their agents to tap wires in aid of detection and conviction of criminals. It is shown that, in spite of its knowledge of the practice, Congress refrained from adopting legislation outlawing it, although bills, so providing, have been introduced. The Communications Act, so it is claimed, was passed only for the purpose of reen- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n acting the provisions of the Radio Act of 19274 so as to make it applicable to wire messages and to transfer jurisdiction over radio and wire communications to the newly constituted Federal Communications Commission, and therefore the phraseology of the statute ought not to be construed as changing the practically identical provision on the subject which was a part of the Radio Act when the Olmstead Case was decided.\n We nevertheless face the fact that the plain words of section 605 forbid anyone, unless authorized by the sender, to intercept a telephone message, and direct in equally clear language that 'no person' shall divulge or publish the message or its substance to 'any person.' To recite the contents of the message in testimony before a court is to divulge the message. The conclusion that the act forbids such testimony seems to us unshaken by the government's arguments.\n True it is that after this court's decision in the Olmstead case Congressional committees investigated the wire-tapping activities of federal agents. Over a period of several years bills were introduced to prohibit the practice, all of which failed to pass. An Act of 1933 included a clause forbidding this method of procuring evidence of violations of the National Prohibition Act. \n5\n During 1932, 1933 and 1934, however, there was no discussion of the matter in Congress, and we are without contemporary legislative history relevant to the passage of the statute in question. It is also true that the committee reports in connection with the Federal Communications Act dwell upon the fact that the major purpose of the legislation was the transfer of jurisdiction over wire and radio communication to the newly constituted Federal Communications Commission. But these circumstances are, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n in our opinion, insufficient to overbear the plain mandate of the statute.\n It is urged that a construction be given the section which would exclude federal agents since it is improbable Congress intended to hamper and impede the activities of the government in the detection and punishment of crime. The answer is that the question is one of policy. Congress may have thought it less important that some offenders should go unwhipped of justice than that officers should resort to methods deemed inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty. The same considerations may well have moved the Congress to adopt section 605 as evoked the guaranty against practices and procedures violative of privacy, embodied in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.\n The canon that the general words of a statute do not include the government or affect its rights unless the construction be clear and indisputable upon the text of the act does not aid the respondent. The cases in which it has been applied fall into two classes. The first is where an act, if not so limited, would deprive the sovereign of a recognized or established prerogative title or interest. \n6\n A classical instance is the exemption of the state from the operation of general statutes of limitation. \n7\n The rule of exclusion of the sovereign is less stringently applied where the operation of the law is upon the agents or servants of the government rather than on the sovereign itself. 8 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n The second class-that where public officers are impliedly excluded from language embracing all persons-is where a reading which would include such officers would work obvious absurdity as, for example, the application of a speed law to a policeman pursuing a criminal or the driver of a fire engine responding to an alarm. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n For years controversy has raged with respect to the morality of the practice of wire-tapping by officers to obtain evidence. It has been the view of many that the practice involves a grave wrong. In the light of these circumstances we think another well recognized principle leads to the application of the statute as it is written so as to include within its sweep federal officers as well as others. That principle is that the sovereign is embraced by general words of a statute intended to prevent injury and wrong. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n I think the word 'person' used in this statute does not include an officer of the federal government, actually engaged in the detection of crime and the enforcement of the criminal statutes of the United States, who has good reason to believe that a telephone is being, or is about to be, used as an aid to the commission or concealment of a crime. The decision just made will necessarily have the effect of enabling the most depraved criminals to further their criminal plans over the telephone, in the secure knowledge that even if these plans involve kidnapping and murder, their telephone conversations can never be intercepted by officers of the law and revealed in court. If Congress thus intended to tie the hands of the government in its effort to protect the people against lawlessness of the most serious character, it would have said so in a more definite way than by the use of the ambiguous word 'person.' Commonwealth v. Welosky, 276 Mass. 398, 404, 404, 406, 177 N.E. 656. For that word has sometimes been construed to include the government and its officials, and sometimes not. I am not aware of any case where it has been given that inclusive effect in a situation such as we have here. Obviously, the situation dealt with in United States v. Arizona, \n295 \nU.S. 174\n, 55 S.Ct. 666, was quite different. There, a federal statute forbade the construction of any bridge, etc., in any port, etc., 'until consent of Congress ... shall have been obtained.' 33 U.S.C.A.  401. The mere building of the designated structure, in the absence of congressional consent, violated the statute. There was no ambiguous term, such as we have here, or anything else in the language, requiring construction. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n There is a manifest difference between the case of a private individual who intercepts a message from motives of curiosity or to further personal ends, and that of a responsible official engaged in the governmental duty of uncovering crime and bringing criminals to justice. It is fair to conclude that the word 'person' as here used was intended to include the former but not the latter. This accords with the well-settled general rule stated by Justice Story in United States v. Hoar, 26 Fed.Cas. pp. 329, 330, No. 15,373, 2 Mason 311, 314, 315: 'In general, acts of the legislature are meant to regulate and direct the acts the rights of citizens; and in most cases the reasoning applicable to them applies with very different, and often contrary force to the government itself. It appears to me, therefore, to be a safe rule founded in the principles of the common law, that the general words of a statute ought not to include the government, or affect its rights, unless that construction be clear and indisputable upon the text of the act.' And see In the Matter of Will of Fox, 52 N.Y. 530, 535, 11 Am.Rep. 751. Conpare State v. Gorham, 110 Wash. 330, 188 P. 457, 9 A.L.R. 365; Balthasar v. Pacific Elec. Ry. Co., 187 Cal. 302, 305-308, 202 P. 37, 19 A.L.R. 452. A case in point is that of People v. Hebberd (Sup.Ct.N.Y.) 96 Misc. 617, 620, 621, 162 N.Y.S. 80.\n In the investigations of the congressional committees, referred to in the opinion of the court, it appeared that the Attorney General had ordered that no tapping of wires should be permitted without the personal direction of the chief of the bureau, after consultation with the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the case; and that such means were to be adopted only as an emergency method. The Attorney General himself appeared before one of the committees and pointed out that crime had become highly organized, with strong political connections and illegal methods of procedure; that gangsters and desperate criminals had equipped themselves with every \n\n[302 \nU.S. 379, 387]\n\u00a0\n modern convenience and invention; that modern gangsters have no regard for life, property, decency or anything else; and he had no doubt that they tapped wires leading to offices of the United States attorneys to find out what was being done. He cited the case of a Bureau of Investigation agent who had been found shot to death under circumstances which indicated that a gang of narcotic traffickers had murdered him; and he posed the question whether, if it had appeared that the perpetrators of the crime could be detected and brought to justice by tapping their telephone wires, nevertheless, that ought not to be done.\n The answer of Congress to the question has been a refusal to pass any of the bills which comprehensively proposed to forbid the practice.\n My abhorrence of the odious practices of the town gossip, the peeping Tom, and the private eavesdropper is quite as strong as that of any of my brethren. But to put the sworn officers of the law, engaged in the detection and apprehension of organized gangs of criminals, in the same category, is to lose all sense of proportion. In view of the safeguards against abuse of power furnished by the order of the Attorney General, and in the light of the deadly conflict constantly being waged between the forces of law and order and the desperate criminals who infest the land, we well may pause to consider whether the application of the rule which forbids an invasion of the privacy of telephone communications is not being carried in the present case to a point where the necessity of public protection against crime is being submerged by an overflow of sentimentality.\n I think the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 652, 48 Stat. 1064, 1103, U.S.C.

BRADLEY(1937)\nNo. 731\nArgued: April 5, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of South Carolina.\n Messrs. W. C. McLain, of Columbia, S.C., Daniel S. Murph, of St. Matthews, S.C., and Martin W. Meyer, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. J. Ivey, Humphrey, of Columbia, S.C., and Wm. C. Wolfe, of Orangeburg, S.C., for appellees. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to 1936 the laws of South Carolina required that manufacturers, before offering mixed commercial fertilizer for sale, should affix to each container a tag disclosing certain facts concerning the contents. Code of Laws, 1932,  6363-6385. An Act approved April 6, 1936 (39 St. at Large, p. 1400), added to section 6367 the following so-called 'Open Formula' amendment, to become effective August 1, 1936\n\n\n'(b) That the amount and analysis of each material, or source, of each plant food element used in manufacture, of a fertilizer mixture containing two or more plant food elements be stated on a tag attached to each sack or container, such amounts of materials to be stated in pounds per hundred pounds of mixture contained in the sack or other container. This statement of pounds of materials used in the manufacture, of a fertilizer mixture shall be in addition to the statement of chemical analysis as required by Section No. 6366 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1932.'\n\n Section 6366 and section 6367 as amended, are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n July 22, 1936, before the officers charged with enforcement of statutes relating to fertilizers formulated any rule or instruction regarding the 'Open Formula' amendment, and before the Supreme Court had considered or construed it, many manufacturers filed their joint bill in the court below, wherein they alleged the amendment offended the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and asked for an injunction. After answer, testimony was presented by both sides. Three judges heard the cause; found the facts; pointed out a possible construction under which they held the act would not be arbitrary or oppressive; and dismissed the bill. The matter is here by appeal.\n As the enactment has not been construed by the enforcing officers nor interpreted by the Supreme Court \n\n[301 \nU.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n of the state, it is impossible to say what ultimately will be demanded of the complainants. The court below was of the opinion that, reasonably construed, the act would be satisfied if the tag upon a given container revealed the general average of the designated items which went into the storage or curing pile of fertilizer at the factory from which such container was filled. 'These piles range from 100 tons up to 5,000 tons.' This interpretation is, at least, permissible. So construed, we cannot say that the act is clearly arbitrary, unreasonable and beyond the police power of the state. Apparently it can be complied with without prohibitive expense. 2 \n\n[301 \nU.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n In response to the assertion that compliance with the 'Open Formula' amendment would require complainants to reveal secret formulas and thus unlawfully deprive them of property, it is enough to refer to Corn Products Refining Company v. Eddy et al., \n249 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, 432 S., 39 S.Ct. 325, 327. 'The right of a manufacturer to maintain secrecy as to his compounds and processes must be held subject to the right of the state, in the exercise of its police power and in promotion of fair dealing, to require that the nature of the product be fairly set forth.' And the same principle is broad enough to meet the further claim of right to sell products manufactured prior to the passage of the amending act of 1936.\n We find no material error. The challenged decree must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  6366. Contents of Labels.-Every person or corporation, before selling or offering for sale in this State any commercial fertilizer or fertilizing material shall brand on each bag or package the brand name of the fertilizer, the weight of the package, the name and address of the manufacturer, and the minimum percentage only guaranteed to be present of available phosphoric acid, of nitrogen (ammonia equivalent), and of potash soluble in water. The items shall be printed on the package in the following order:\n Weight of each package.\n Brand name or trade-mark.\n Guaranteed analysis:\n Available phosphoric acid ... per cent. Ammonia equivalent of nitrogen ... per cent.\n Potash soluble in water ... per cent.\n Name and address of the manufacturer.\n In addition to the above there must be printed on the package, or on a tag attached thereto, the per cent. of water soluble nitrogen (ammonia equivalent), guaranteed, within such limits as the said board of trustees, or a committee thereof, may prescribe. And, in addition, further, it must be stated whether the potash is derived from muriate or sulphate. And, in addition, further, the per cent. of borax or other substance, or substances, injurious to plants must be stated, if in excess of limits prescribed by the board of trustees, or a committee thereof: Provided, The said board of trustees, or a committee thereof, shall have power to direct in what manner the branding and labeling shall be done.\n\n  6367. Classification of Materials-Labeling-Substitution-Special Contracts-Damages and Penalty.-(a) That the materials used in the manufacture and mixing of all fertilizers supplying nitrogen or ammonia, and offered for sale in this State, shall be divided into two classes, namely, water-soluble and available water-insoluble; and the percentage of nitrogen or ammonia coming from either of these two classes shall be guaranteed, but allowing a variability of one-fourth of one per cent. for goods containing two percent. of ammonia or under, and a variability of one-third of one per cent. for goods containing two and three per cent. ammonia, and a variability of one-half of one per cent. for goods containing over three per cent. ammonia, and the several materials in each of these two classes shall be named on the bag or on a tag attached thereto, and it shall be permissible for the manufacturer to substitute one or more materials in either class of approximately equal agricultural value for other materials of the same class: Provided, That where there is a contract of agreement between a manufacturer and a purchaser of fertilizer that the fertilizer will be manufactured by the use of certain definite sources and amounts of ammonia and potash, the fertilizer must be manufactured from these materials without substitution of other materials and failure on the part of the manufacturer to comply with this requirement shall render the manufacturer liable to the purchaser for damages as it is now prescribed by law, and in addition thereto the manufacturer shall pay to the purchaser a penalty equal to one-fourth of the purchase price of such fertilizer.\n (b) That the amount and analysis of each material, or source, of each plant food element used in manufacture, of a fertilizer mixture containing two or more plant food elements be stated on a tag attached to each sack or container, such amounts of materials to be stated in pounds per hundred pounds of mixture contained in the sack or other container. This statement of pounds of materials used in the manufacture of a fertilizer mixture shall be in addition to the statement of chemical analysis as required by Section No. 6366 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1932. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Findings of Fact as to Reasonableness of Regulations-No. VI.\n'With the foregoing illustration of the application of the requirements of the new law to the actual facts of agriculture, we have no hesitation in finding as a fact that the requirements of the 1936 Amendment do most positively tend to meet an actually existing need and to serve the purpose which the Legislature clearly had in mind; namely, to so regulate the fertilizer business as to give the farmer that information which would tend to aid in the carrying on of the major industry of the State of South Carolina.'\n\n Findings of Fact as to Information Required by the Act, &c.-No. II.\n'The word 'mixture' has under the testimony come to have a rather definite meaning in the fertilizer business. It relates not so much to the finished product in the sack as it does to the actual pile of fertilizer as mixed in the manufacturing plant and left to cure before being finally ground up and put into sacks. The testimony deals fully with the actual processes followed in the mixing of the fertilizer, and the greater weight of the testimony suggests that the average unit of mixture as actually made by the larger fertilizer companies when making a typical fertilizer for sale in large quantities is about five thousand tons. Under the testimony we find that in some cases a strict compliance with the statute will probably call for a large warehouse and the inauguration of a more elaborate system of bookkeeping as to the exact materials put into each mixture but these increased expenses will not be so great as to render the cost of the manufacture of the finished product prohibitive and out of line with the probable increase of prices which the actual trade would bear.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BD. v.

Leonard Weinberg and Harry J. Green, both of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 70]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board, by its orders of March 28, 1936, required the respondent, Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Company, Inc., to cease and desist from discharging any of its employees or otherwise discriminating in regard to the tenure and conditions of their employment, and from threatening such action, for the reason that such employees have joined or assisted the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America or otherwise engaged in union activity; from maintaining surveillance \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 71]\n\u00a0\n of the activities of the labor organization and to their employees in connection therewith; and from interfering in any manner with, or coercing, its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization and representation for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection as guaranteed in section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (29 U.S.C.A.  157). The orders also required respondent to offer reinstatement to certain discharged employees, to make good their loss of pay, and to post notices for thirty days that respondent would cease and desist from the practices restrained by the orders. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to enforce the orders, 85 F.( 2d) 1, and this Court granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 535\n, 57 S.Ct. 120, 81 L. Ed. --.\n The proceeding was initiated by the National Labor Relations Board upon charges that the respondent had discharged certain employees because they had engaged in union activities. The Board issued two complaints alleging unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.). Notice of hearing was given, respondent appeared specially and moved to dismiss the complaints upon the grounds that the act, and the proceedings before the Board, were in contravention of articles 1 and 3 and the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Thirteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. Reserving these objections, respondent filed answers denying all the allegations of the complaints except that respondent is a Virginia corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing men's clothing in Richmond. The Board overruled the objections to its jurisdiction and the validity of the act. For the purpose of presenting the constitutional questions, and to expedite the proceedings, counsel for respondent announced at the beginning of the hearings 'that he would not cross-examine any of the Board's witnesses and would not offer any countervailing evi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 72]\n\u00a0\n dence.' The Board received evidence and made its findings. There were numerous objections by respondent to the competency and relevancy of certain testimony.\n The Board found: Respondent, a Virginia corporation, has its plant at Richmond, where it is engaged in the purchase of raw materials and the manufacture, sale and distribution of men's clothing. The principal materials are woolen and worsted goods. 99.57 per cent. of these goods come from states other than Virginia, 75 per cent. being purchased in New York and fabricated for the most part in other states. Cotton linings come from several southern states. Particulars as to the sources of other materials are set forth. Of the garments manufactured by respondent, 82.8 per cent. are purchased by customers outside the state, mainly by department stores and men's clothing stores in the larger cities throughout the country. Respondent maintains a sales office and showroom in New York City through which 15 or 20 per cent. of the total sales are made. Orders are sent to the Richmond plant, the goods being sold f.o.b. Richmond. In 1932, the volume of respondent's business amounted to $800, 000 and 80,000 units, increasing to $1,750,000 and 150,000 units in the first ten months of 1935\n\n\n The Board made elaborate findings with respect to the clothing manufacturing industry and its relation to interstate commerce. Among these findings are the following: The men's clothing industry is among the twenty most important manufacturing industries in this country. 50 per cent. of the manufacturing establishments are in the state of New York; most of the remainder are in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California and Ohio. Since the men's wear fabrics are produced largely in the New England States, the goods must be transported from the mills across state lines to the fabricating establishments in the states above \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 73]\n\u00a0\n mentioned. The manufactured clothing is sold throughout the nation, only about 48 per cent. of the total sales being made in the seven states which produce about 90 per cent. of the total men's clothing. The findings describe the methods of sales, the New York market being the largest in the country. The Board concluded: 'The men's clothing industry is thus an industry which is nearly entirely dependent in its operations upon purchases and sales in interstate commerce and upon interstate transportation. There is a constant flow of raw wool from the western States and foreign countries to the mills of New England where it is transformed into men's wear fabrics, thence to the sponging and shrinking plants of New York and Philadelphia, then, joined by the other necessary raw materials, to the fabricating factories of the Middle Atlantic States for manufacture into clothing. ... The industry itself has no doubt as to its status, for the Executive Director of the New York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange, Inc., which represents about 250 manufacturers doing 70 per cent. of the total business in the New York market, stated in his affidavit that the industry is conducted as an interstate business and is entirely dependent upon interstate commerce.'\n The Board also made findings in relation to the labor organization here involved. The Board found: 'The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America is a labor organization composed of over 125,000 men and women employed in the men's and boys' clothing industry. ... The period before the recognition by the employers of the Amalgamated was marked by long and bitter strikes. In 1921 there had been a general strike in New York City which had lasted for eight months and caused losses of millions of dollars to employers and employees. A similar general strike in New York in 1924 lasted for six weeks and involved all of the 500 firms in that area and their \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 74]\n\u00a0\n 35,000 workers. The wage loss to the workers was nearly $6,000,000, the financial loss to the manufacturers ran into the millions. ... This costly industrial strife resulted finally in recognition of the Amalgamated by the employers. ... The New York strike of 1924 was ended by the establishment of a collective agreement between the leading manufacturers and the Amalgamated which was soon joined in by other manufacturers in that area. Factories in Rochester, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St. Louis and Philadelphia recognized the union and entered into agreements with it. Today the Amalgamated has collective agreements with clothing manufacturers and contractors employing the greater number of the clothing workers in the United States. These collective agreements have brought peace to that portion of the industry that has entered such agreements. ... Since the signing of the collective agreement for the New York area, and New York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange, Inc. and the Amalgamated have handled jointly a total of 21,193 complaints and disputes. In only 898 of these cases, or slightly over 4 per cent., was a resort to arbitration required because of inability to agree. Of these 898, 30 per cent. were settled by the impartial chairman acting as a mediator; in the remainder he sat as an arbitrator and rendered a decision. ... The President of the New York Clothing Manufacturers Exchange, Inc. ... has stated that the 'organization of collective bargaining machinery, the establishment of an impartial tribunal, and the founding of unemployment insurance are the outstanding achievements' in the industry and that the Amalgamated Clothing Workers 'has been perhaps the largest single contributing factor to the lasting peace and harmony that have characterized those clothing markets where the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was the other contracting party to the collective agreement.\" \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 75]\n\u00a0\n With respect to unfair labor practices, the Board found that in the summer of 1935 employees of respondent had formed a local union of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and were soliciting membership therein. Respondent's management 'at once indicated hostility to the union organization of its employees and declared that it would not permit them to join the Amalgamated.' Statements of the president of the respondent showing his antagonism to the union were quoted by the Board. At one time he stated to a group of employees that he would discharge every one that attended the union meeting. Similar statements were made by respondent's secretary. Respondent's management 'has maintained surveillance over union meetings and activities.' The findings set forth the circumstances of the discharge of employees. The Board concluded that these discharges were because of the membership of the employees in the labor organization and their activities in connection with it. The Board also found that interference in the industry with the activities of employees in joining and assisting labor organizations and the refusal to accept the procedure of collective bargaining had led, and tends to lead, to strikes and other labor disputes that burden and obstruct commerce.\n The findings of the Board both as to the nature of respondent's business and the circumstances of the discharge of its employees are supported by the evidence.\n For the reasons stated in our opinion in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. --, decided this day, we hold that the objections raised by respondent to the construction and validity of the National Labor Relations Act are without merit. The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent.

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 630, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 76]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the following dissenting opinion.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER and I are unable to agree with the decisions just announced.\n We conclude that these causes were rightly decided by the three Circuit Courts of Appeals and that their judgments should be affirmed. The opinions there given without dissent are terse, well-considered and sound. They disclose the meaning ascribed by experienced judges to what this Court has often declared and are set out below in full.\n Considering the far-reaching import of these decisions, the departure from what we understand has been consistently ruled here, and the extraordinary power confirmed to a Board of three,1 the obligation to present our views becomes plain.\n The Court as we think departs from well-established principles followed in Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947 (May, 1935), and Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855 (May, 1936). Upon the authority of those decisions, the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Fifth, Sixth and Second Circuits in the causes now before us have held the power of Congress under the commerce clause does not extend to relations between employers and their employees engaged in manufacture, and therefore the act conferred upon the National Labor Relations Board no authority in respect of matters covered by the questioned orders. In Foster Bros. Mfg. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 85 F.(2d) 984, the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, held the act inapplicable to manufacture and expressed the view that if so extended it \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 77]\n\u00a0\n would be invalid. Six District Courts, on the authority of Schechter's and Carter's Cases, have held that the Board has no authority to regulate relations between employers and employees engaged in local production.a No decision or judicial opinion to the contrary has been cited, and we find none. Every consideration brought forward to uphold the act before us was applicable to support the acts held unconstitutional in causes decided within two years. And the lower courts rightly deemed them controlling.\n By its terms the Labor Act extends to employers-large and small- unless excluded by definition,2 and declares that, if one of these interferes with, restrains, or coerces any employee regarding his labor affiliations, etc., this shall be regarded as unfair labor practice. And a 'labor organization' means any organization of any kind or any agency or employee representation committee or plan which exists for the purpose in whole or in part of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor dis- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 78]\n\u00a0\n putes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work.b\n The three respondents happen to be manufacturing concerns-one large, two relatively small. The act is now applied to each upon grounds common to all. Obviously what is determined as to these concerns may gravely affect a multitude of employers who engage in a great variety of private enterprises-mercantile, manufacturing, publishing, stock-raising, mining, etc. It puts into the hands of a Board power of control over purely local industry beyond anything heretofore deemed permissible. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 79]\n\u00a0\n II.\n (No. 419) Circuit Court of Appeals (Fifth Circuit)\n (National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation)\n Opinion June 15, 1936, 83 F.(2d) 998\n Before Foster, Sibley, and Hutcheson, Circuit Judges.\n By the Court: 'The National Labor Relations Board has petitioned us to enforce an order made by it, which requires Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, to reinstate certain discharged employees in its steel plant in Aliquippa, Pa., and to do other things in that connection.\n'The petition must be denied, because, under the facts found by the Board and shown by the evidence, the Board has no jurisdiction over a labor dispute between employer and employees touching the discharge of laborers in a steel plant, who were engaged only in manufacture. The Constitution does not vest in the Federal Government the power to regulate the relation as such of employer and employee in production or manufacture.\n\n\"One who produces or manufactures a commodity, subsequently sold and shipped by him in interstate commerce, whether such sale and shipment were originally intended or not, has engaged in two distinct and separate activities. So far as he produces or manufactures a commodity, his business is purely local. So far as he sells and ships, or contracts to sell and ship, the commodity to customers in another state, he engages in interstate commerce. In respect of the former, he is subject only to regulation by the state; in respect of the latter, to regulation only by the federal government. Utah Power & L. Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 182\n, 52 S.Ct. 548. Production is not commerce; but a step in preparation for commerce. Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 584\n-587, 54 S. Ct. 541.\n\n\"We have seen that the word 'commerce' is the equivalent of the phrase 'intercourse for the purposes of trade.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 80]\n\u00a0\n Plainly, the incidents leading up to and culminating in the mining of coal do not constitute such intercourse. The employment of men, the fixing of their wages, hours of labor, and working conditions, the bargaining in respect of these things-whether carried on separately or collectively-each and all constitute intercourse for the purposes of production, not of trade. The latter is a thing apart from the relation of employer and employee, which in all producing occupations is purely local in character. Extraction of coal from the mine is the aim and the completed result of local activities. Commerce in the coal mined is not brought into being by force of these activities, but by negotiations, agreements, and circumstances entirely apart from production. Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it.' Carter v. Carter Coal Company (\n298 \nU.S. 238\n) 56 S.Ct. 855, decided May 18, 1936.\n\n'That the employer has a very large business, the interruption of which by a strike of employees which might happen, and that in consequence of such strike production might be stopped and interstate commerce in the products affected, does not make the regulation of the relation justified under the commerce power of Congress, because the possible effect on interstate commerce is too remote to warrant Federal invasion of the state's right to regulate the employer-employee relation. Nor is it important that the employer imports part of his raw materials in interstate commerce and sells and exports a large part of his product in interstate commerce, which imports and exports would possibly be stopped by a possible strike. The employers' entire business thus connected together does not, as respects federal power, make a case different from that in which importation of materials, manufacture of them, and sale and export of the product are conducted by three persons. The employer here by doing \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 81]\n\u00a0\n all three things does not alter the respective constitutional spheres of the federal and state governments. The making and fabrication of steel by Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation is production regulable by the state of Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the corporation also engages in interstate commerce regulable by Congress in bringing in its raw materials and again in selling and delivering its products. No specific present intent appears to impede or destroy interstate commerce by means of a strike in a manufacturing plant, or other like direct obstruction to or burden on interstate commerce. The order we are asked to enforce is not shown to be one authorized to be made under the authority of Congress. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., supra.\n\n'The petition is denied.'\n\n\n\n III.\n\n\n (Nos. 420-421) Circuit Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit)\n (Fruehauf Trailer Co. v. National Labor Relations Board)\n Opinion June 30, 1936, 85 F.(2d) 391\n Before Moorman, Hicks, and Simons, Circuit Judges.\n'Per Curiam. The National Labor Relations Board has filed a petition in this court to enforce an order issued by it in proceedings which it instituted against the Fruehauf Trailer Company. The order directs the Trailer Company to cease and desist from discharging or threatening to discharge any of its employees because of their activities in connection with the United Automobile Workers Federal Labor Union No. 19,375, to cease discouraging its employees from becoming members of that union, to offer to certain of its former employees immediate and full reinstatement in their former positions without prejudice to their seniority rights, to make such employees whole for any losses of pay that they have suffered by reason of their discharge by paying \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 82]\n\u00a0\n them what they would have earned as wages from the dates of their discharges, and to post notices throughout its Detroit plant, in conspicuous places, stating that it has ceased and desisted from discharging or threatening to discharge its employees for joining the United Automobile Workers Federal Labor Union No. 19,375. The Fruehauf Trailer Company has filed its petition seeking a review of the order and praying that the court set it aside. The record of the proceeding before the Labor Board has been filed and the two petitions have been heard together in this court.\n\n'The Fruehauf Trailer Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Michigan and is engaged in the manufacture, assembly, and sale of automobile trailers at its plant in Detroit, Mich. The material and parts used in the manufacture and production of the trailers are shipped to the plant. After the trailers are manufactured, many of them are shipped to other states for sale and use. The order in question undertakes to regulate and control the Trailer Company's relations and dealings with its employees engaged in the production and manufacture of trailers at the company's plant in Detroit and does not directly affect any of the activities of the Trailer Company in the purchasing and transporting to its plant of materials and parts for the manufacture and production of trailers or in the shipping or selling of such trailers after they are manufactured. It was issued under the authority of the Act of Congress of July 5, 1935, known as the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.). The authority for the act is claimed under the commerce clause of the Constitution. Since the order is directed to the control and regulation of the relations between the Trailer Company and its employees in respect to their activities in the manufacture and production of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 83]\n\u00a0\n trailers and does not directly affect any phase of any interstate commerce in which the Trailer Company may be engaged, and since, under the ruling of Carter v. Carter Coal Company (\n298 \nU.S. 238\n) 56 S.Ct. 855 (decided May 18, 1936), the Congress has no authority or power to regulate or control such relations between the Trailer Company and its employees, the National Labor Relations Board was without authority to issue the order. See National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation (C.C.A.5) 83 F.(2d) 998, decided June 15, 1936.\n\n'The petition of the Board is accordingly dismissed and the order is set aside.'\n\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n (Nos. 422-423) Circuit Court of Appeals (Second Circuit)\n (National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co.)\n Opinion July 13, 1936, 85 F.(2d) 1\n Before Manton, Swan, and A.N. Hand, Circuit Judges.\n'Per Curiam. The respondent, a Virginia corporation, is a manufacturer of men's clothing with its principal office and its factory in Richmond, Va. Practically all the raw materials used are brought from other states into Virginia, where respondent manufactures them into men's clothing. About 83 per cent. of the manufactured products are sold f.o.b. Richmond, to customers located in states other than Virginia.\n\n'Two sets of charges were filed with petitioner's local regional director by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, a labor union of workers in the men's clothing industry, in which it was alleged that the respondent violated the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.) by discharging from its employ, and discriminating against 29 out of 800 of its employees, because they had engaged in union activities. The Board filed complaints under section 10(b) of the act (29 U.S.C.A. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 84]\n\u00a0\n s 160(b), and after a hearing respondent was found to have violated the act and was ordered to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices.\n\n'Petitioner's theory is that the respondent is engaged in interstate commerce because of the shipment of raw materials to it from other states and the shipment of its finished products to other states, and, in addition, that the flow of commerce doctrine, as exemplified in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, brings this manufacturer within the federal power to regulate commerce. Respondent contends that the National Labor Relations Act, as applied to it, is unconstitutional and therefore invalid, and that the attempt to enforce its provisions against it is illegal.\n\n'It is shown that the alleged unfair labor practices complained of occurred in the manufacture of clothing in Richmond, Va. None of the workers involved had to do with the transportation of the clothing after its manufacture. They were engaged in various operations in the Richmond factory.\n\n'The relations between the employer and its employees in this manufacturing industry were merely incidents of production. In its manufacturing, respondent was in no way engaged in interstate commerce, nor did its labor practices so directly affect interstate commerce as to come within the federal commerce power. Carter v. Carter Coal Co. (\n298 \nU.S. 238\n), 56 S.Ct. 855, May 18, 1936; Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. No authority warrants the conclusion that the powers of the Federal Government permit the regulation of the dealings between employers or employees when engaged in the purely local business of manufacture.\n\n'Therefore the orders to cease and desist may not be enforced.\n\n'Petitions denied.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 85]\n\u00a0\n V.\n\n In each cause the Labor Board formulated and then sustained a charge of unfair labor practices towards persons employed only in production. It ordered restoration of discharged employees to former positions with payment for losses sustained. These orders were declared invalid below upon the ground that respondents while carrying on production operations were not thereby engaging in interstate commerce; that labor practices in the course of such operations did not directly affect interstate commerce; consequently respondents' actions did not come within congressional power.\n Respondent in No. 419 is a large, integrated manufacturer of iron and steel products-the fourth largest in the United States. It has two production plants in Pennsylvania where raw materials brought from points outside the state are converted into finished products, which are thereafter distributed in interstate commerce throughout many states. The Corporation has assets amounting to $180,000,000, gross income $47,000,000, and employs 22,000 people-10,000 in the Aliquippa plant where the complaining employees worked. So far as they relate to essential principles presently important, the activities of this Corporation, while large, do not differ materially from those of the other respondents and very many small producers and distributors. It has attained great size; occupies an important place in business; owns and operates mines of ore, coal, and limestone outside Pennsylvania, the output of which, with other raw material, moves to the production plants. At the plants this movement ends. Having come to rest, this material remains in warehouses, storage yards, etc., often for months, until the process of manufacture begins. After this has been completed, the finished products go into interstate commerce. The discharged employees labored only in the manufac- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 86]\n\u00a0\n turing department. They took no part in the transportation to or away from the plant; nor did they participate in any activity which preceded or followed manufacture.\n Our concern is with those activities which are common to the three enterprises. Such circumstances as are merely fortuitous-size, character of products, etc.-may be put on one side. The wide sweep of the statute will more readily appear if consideration be given to the Board's proceedings against the smallest and relatively least important-the Clothing Company. If the act applies to the relations of that Company to employees in production, of course it applies to the larger respondents with like business elements although the affairs of the latter may present other characteristics. Though differing in some respects, all respondents procure raw materials outside the state where they manufacture, fabricate within and then ship beyond the state.\n In Nos. 420, 421, the respondent, Michigan corporation, manufactures commercial trailers for automobiles from raw materials brought from outside that state, and thereafter sells these in many states. It has a single manufacturing plant at Detroit and annual receipts around $3,000, 000; 900 people are employed.\n In Nos. 422, 423, the respondent is a Virginia corporation engaged in manufacturing and distributing men's clothing. It has a single plant and chief office at Richmond, annual business amounting perhaps to $2,000,000, employs 800, brings in almost all raw material from other states and ships the output in interstate commerce. There are some 3,300 similar plants for manufacturing clothing in the United States, which together employ 150,000 persons and annually put out products worth $800,000,000. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 87]\n\u00a0\n VI.\n The Clothing Company is a typical small manufacturing concern which produces less than one-half of one per cent. of the men's clothing produced in the United States and employs 800 of the 150,000 workmen engaged therein. If closed today, the ultimate effect on commerce in clothing obviously would be negligible. It stands alone, is not seeking to acquire a monopoly or to restrain trade. There is no evidence of a strike by its employees at any time or that one is now threatened, and nothing to indicate the probable result if one should occur.\n Some account of the Labor Board's proceedings against this Company will indicate the ambit of the act as presently construed.\n September 28, 1935, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, purporting to act under section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 3 filed with the Board a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 88]\n\u00a0\n 'Charge,' stating that the Clothing Company had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the act-section 8(1)(3), 29 U.S.C.A.  158 ( 1, 3)-in that it had, on stated days in August and September, 1935, unjustifiably discharged, demoted or discriminated against some 20 named members of that union and, in other ways, had restrained, interfered with and coerced employees in the exercise of their right of free choice of representatives for collective bargaining. And further 'that said labor practices are unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of said Act.'\n This 'Charge' contained no discription of the Company's business, no word concerning any strike against it past, present or threatened. The number of persons employed or how many of these had joined the union is not disclosed.\n Thereupon the Board issued a 'Complaint' which recited the particulars of the 'Charge,' alleged incorporation of the Company in Virginia, and ownership of a plant at Richmond where it is continuously engaged in the 'production, sale and distribution of men's clothing'; that material is brought from other states and manufactured into clothing, which is sold and shipped to many states, etc.-' all of aforesaid constituting a continuous flow of commerce among the several states.' Also that while operating the Richmond plant the Clothing Company discharged, demoted, laid off or discriminated against some 20 persons 'employed in production at the said plant ... for the reason that all of the said employees, and each of them, joined and assisted a labor organization known as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and engaged in concerted activities with other employees for the purpose of collective bargaining and other mutual aid and protection,' etc. Further, that the Company circulated among its employees and under \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 89]\n\u00a0\n took to coerce them to sign a writing expressing satisfaction with conditions; induced some members of the union to withdraw; did other similar things, etc.-all of which amounted to unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of section 8(1)(3)(4)4 and section 2( 6)(7)5 of the Labor Act. 'The aforesaid unfair labor practices occur in commerce among the several states, and on the basis of experience in the aforesaid plant and others in the same and other industries, burden and obstruct such commerce and the free flow thereof and have led and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing such commerce and the free flow thereof.'\n The complaint says nothing concerning any strike against the Clothing Company past, present or threatened; there is no allegation concerning the number of persons employed, how many joined the union, or the value of the output. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 90]\n\u00a0\n The respondent filed a special appearance objecting to the Board's jurisdiction, which was overruled; also an answer admitting the discharge of certain employees, but otherwise it generally denied the allegations of the 'Complaint.'\n Thereupon the Board demanded access to the Company's private records of accounts, disclosure of the amount of capital invested by its private owners, the names of all of its employees, its pay rolls, the amounts and character of all purchases and from whom made, the amounts of sales and to whom made, including the number and kind of units, the number of employees in the plant \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 91]\n\u00a0\n during eight years, the names and addresses of the directors and officers of the Company, the names and addresses of its salesmen, the stock ownership of the Company, the affiliation, if any, with other companies, and the former occupations and businesses of its stockholders.\n During hearings held at Richmond and Washington, unfettered by rules of evidence, it received a mass of testimony-largely irrelevant. Much related to the character of respondent's business, general methods used in the men's clothing industry, the numbers employed and the general effect of strikes therein. The circumstances attending the discharge or demotion of the specified employees were brought out.\n Following this the Board found-\n The men's clothing industry of the United States ranks sixteenth in the number of wage earners employed, with more than 3,000 firms and 150, 000 workers engaged. The steps in the typical process of manufacture are described. Raw material is brought in from many states, and after fabrication the garments are sold and delivered through canvassers and retailers. 'The men's clothing industry is thus an industry which is nearly entirely dependent in its operations upon purchases and sales in interstate commerce and upon interstate transportation.'\n The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America is a labor organization composed of over 125,000 men and women employed in making clothing. Members are organized in local unions. Before recognition of this union by employers long and bitter strikes occurred, some of which are described. The union has striven consistently to improve the general economic and social conditions of members. Benefits that flow from recognizing and co- operating with it are realized by manufacturers.\n Description is given of the Clothing Company's operations, the sources of its raw material (nearly all outside \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 92]\n\u00a0\n Virginia), and the method used to dispose of its output. Eighty-two per cent. is sold to customers beyond Virginia. It is among the fifty largest firms in the industry, and among the ten of that group paying the lowest average wage.\n In the summer of 1935 the employees at the Richmond plant formed a local of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and solicited memberships. The management at once indicated opposition and declared it would not permit employees to join. Hostile acts and the circumstances of the discharge or demotion of complaining employees are described. It is said all were discharged or demoted because of union membership. And further that 'Interference by employers in the men's clothing industry with the activities of employees in joining and assisting labor organizations and their refusal to accept the procedure of collective bargaining has led and tends to lead to strikes and other labor disputes that burden and obstruct commerce and the free flow thereof. In those cases where the employees have been permitted to organize freely and the employers have been willing to bargain collectively, strikes and industrial unrest have gradually disappeared, as shown in Finding 19. But where the employer has taken the contrary position, strikes have ensued that have resulted in substantial or total cessation of production in the factories involved and obstruction to and burden upon the flow of raw materials and finished garments in interstate commerce.'\n The number of employees who joined the union does not appear; the general attitude of employees towards the union or the Company is not disclosed; the terms of employment are not stated-whether at will, by the day or by the month. What the local chapter was especially seeking at the time we do not know.\n It does not appear that, either prior or subsequent to the 'Complaint,' there has been any strike, disorder or \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 93]\n\u00a0\n industrial strife at respondent's factory, or any interference with or stoppage of production or shipment of its merchandise. Nor that alleged unfair labor practices at its plant had materially affected manufacture, sale or distribution; or materially affected, burdened or obstructed the flow of products; or affected, burdened or obstructed the flow of interstate commerce, or tended to do so.\n The Board concluded that the Clothing Company had discriminated in respect to tenure and employment and thereby had discouraged membership in the union; that it had interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in violation of rights guaranteed by section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act; that these acts occurred in the course and conduct of commerce among the states, immediately affect employees engaged in the course and conduct of interstate commerce, and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing such commerce and the free flow thereof.\n An order followed, March 28, 1936, which commanded immediate reinstatement of eight discharged employees and payment of their losses; also that the Company should cease and desist from discharging or discriminating against employees because of connections with the union, should post notices, etc. On the same day the Board filed a petition asking enforcement of the order in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) at New York, which was denied July 13, 1936. National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co., 85 F.( 2d) 1.\n\n\n VII.\n\n\n The precise question for us to determine is whether in the circumstances disclosed Congress has power to authorize what the Labor Board commanded the respondent to do. Stated otherwise, in the circumstances here existing could Congress by statute direct what the Board has ordered? General disquisitions concerning the en- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 94]\n\u00a0\n actment are of minor, if any, importance. Circumstances not treated as essential to the exercise of power by the Board may, of course, be disregarded. The record in Nos. 422, 423-a typical case-plainly presents these essentials and we may properly base further discussion upon the circumstances there disclosed.\n A relatively small concern caused raw material to be shipped to its plant at Richmond, Va., converted this into clothing, and thereafter shipped the product to points outside the State. A labor union sought members among the employees at the plant and obtained some. The Company's management opposed this effort, and in order to discourage it discharged eight who had become members. The business of the Company is so small that to close its factory would have no direct or material effect upon the volume of interstate commerce in clothing. The number of operatives who joined the union is not disclosed; the wishes of other employees is not shown; probability of a strike is not found.\n The argument in support of the Board affirms: 'Thus the validity of any specific application of the preventive measures of this Act depends upon whether industrial strife resulting from the practices in the particular enterprise under consideration would be of the character which Federal power could control if it occurred. If strife in that enterprise could be controlled, certainly it could be prevented.'\n Manifestly that view of congressional power would extend it into almost every field of human industry. With striking lucidity, fifty years ago, Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 9 S.Ct. 6, 10, declared: 'If it be held that the term (commerce with foreign nations and among the several states) includes the regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be the subject of commercial transactions in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 95]\n\u00a0\n the future, it is impossible to deny that it would also include all productive industries that contemplate the same thing. The result would be that congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the states, with the power to regulate, not only manufacture, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock-raising, domestic fisheries, mining,-in short, every branch of human industry.' This doctrine found full approval in United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 15 S.Ct. 249, 253; Schechter Poultry Corporation et al. v. United States, supra, and Carter v. Carter Coal Co. et al., supra, where the authorities are collected and principles applicable here are discussed.\n In Knight's Case, Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the Court, said: 'Doubtless the power to control the manufacture of a given thing involves, in a certain sense, the control of its disposition, but this is a secondary, and not the primary, sense; and, although the exercise of that power may result in bringing the operation of commerce into play, it does not control it, and affects it only incidentally and indirectly. Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it. ... It is vital that the independence of the commercial power and of the police power, and the delimitation between them, however sometimes perplexing, should always be recognized and observed, for, while the one furnishes the strongest bond of union, the other is essential to the preservation of the autonomy of the states as required by our dual form of government; and acknowledged evils, however grave and urgent they may appear to be, had better be borne, than the risk be run, in the effort to suppress them, of more serious consequences by resort to expedients of even doubtful constitutionality.'\n In Schechter's Case we said: 'In determining how far the federal government may go in controlling intrastate transactions upon the ground that they 'affect' interstate \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 96]\n\u00a0\n commerce, there is a necessary and well-established distinction between direct and indirect effects. The precise line can be drawn only as individual cases arise, but the distinction is clear in principle. ... But where the effect of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce is merely indirect, such transactions remain within the domain of state power. If the commerce clause were construed to reach all enterprises and transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people, and the authority of the state over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government. Indeed, on such a theory, even the development of the state's commercial facilities would be subject to federal control.'\n Carter's Case declared-'Whether the effect of a given activity or condition is direct or indirect is not always easy to determine. The word 'direct' implies that the activity or condition invoked or blamed shall operate proximately-not mediately, remotely, or collaterally-to produce the effect. It connotes the absence of an efficient intervening agency or condition. And the extent of the effect bears no logical relation to its character. The distinction between a direct and an indirect effect turns, not upon the magnitude of either the cause or the effect, but entirely upon the manner in which the effect has been brought about. If the production by one man of a single ton of coal intended for interstate sale and shipment, and actually so sold and shipped, affects interstate commerce indirectly, the effect does not become direct by multiplying the tonnage, or increasing the number of men employed, or adding to the expense or complexities of the business, or by all combined.'\n Any effect on interstate commerce by the discharge of employees shown here would be indirect and remote in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 97]\n\u00a0\n the highest degree, as consideration of the facts will show. In No. 419 ten men out of ten thousand were discharged; in the other cases only a few. The immediate effect in the factor may be to create discontent among all those employed and a strike may follow, which, in turn, may result in reducing production, which ultimately may reduce the volume of goods moving in interstate commerce. By this chain of indirect and progressively remote events we finally reach the evil with which it is said the legislation under consideration undertakes to deal. A more remote and indirect interference with interstate commerce or a more definite invasion of the powers reserved to the states is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine.\n The Constitution still recognizes the existence of states with indestructible powers; the Tenth Amendment was supposed to put them beyond controversy.\n We are told that Congress may protect the 'stream of commerce' and that one who buys raw material without the state, manfactures it therein, and ships the output to another state is in that stream. Therefore it is said he may be prevented from doing anything which may interfere with its flow.\n This, too, goes beyond the constitutional limitations heretofore enforced. If a man raises cattle and regularly delivers them to a carrier for interstate shipment, may Congress prescribe the conditions under which he may employ or discharge helpers on the ranch? The products of a mine pass daily into interstate commerce; many things are brought to it from other states. Are the owners and the miners within the power of Congress in respect of the latter's tenure and discharge? May a mill owner be prohibited from closing his factory or discontinuing his business because so to do would stop the flow of products to and from his plant in interstate commerce? \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 98]\n\u00a0\n May employees in a factory be restrained from quitting work in a body because this will close the factory and thereby stop the flow of commerce? May arson of a factory be made a federal offense whenever this would interfere with such flow? If the business cannot continue with the existing wage scale, may Congress command a reduction? If the ruling of the Court just announced is adhered to, these questions suggest some of the problems certain to arise.\n And if this theory of a continuous 'stream of commerce' as now defined is correct, will it become the duty of the federal government hereafter to suppress every strike which by possibility it may cause a blockade in that stream? In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 15 S.Ct. 900, Moreover, since Congress has intervened, are labor relations between most manufacturers and their employees removed from all control by the state? Oregon-Washington R. Co. v. Washington (1926) \n270 \nU.S. 87\n, 46 S.Ct. 279.\n To this argument Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co., et al., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 150\n, 39 S.Ct. 237, affords an adequate reply. No such continuous stream is shown by these records as that which counsel assume.\n There is no ground on which reasonably to hold that refusal by a manufacturer, whose raw materials come from states other than that of his factory and whose products are regularly carried to other states, to bargain collectively with employees in his manufacturing plant, directly affects interstate commerce. In such business, there is not one but who distinct movements or streams in interstate transportation. The first brings in raw material and there ends. Then follows manufacture, a separate and local activity. Upon completion of this and not before, the second distinct movement or stream in interstate commerce begins and the products go to other states. Such is the common course for small as well as \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 99]\n\u00a0\n large industries. It is unreasonable and unprecedented to say the commerce clause confers upon Congress power to govern relations between employers and employees in these local activities. Stout v. Pratt (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 864. In Schechter's Case we condemned as unauthorized by the commerce clause assertion of federal power in respect of commodities which had come to rest after interstate transportation. And, in Carter's Case, we held Congress lacked power to regulate labor relations in respect of commodities before interstate commerce has begun.\n It is gravely stated that experience teaches that if an employer discourages membership in 'any organization of any kind' 'in which employees participate, and which exists for the purpose in whole or in part of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work,' discontent may follow and this in turn may lead to a strike, and as the outcome of the strike there may be a block in the stream of interstate commerce. Therefore Congress may inhibit the discharge! Whatever effect any cause of discontent may ultimately have upon commerce is far too indirect to justify congressional regulation. Almost anything-marriage, birth, death-may in some fashion affect commerce.\n\n\n VIII.\n\n\n That Congress has power by appropriate means, not prohibited by the Constitution, to prevent direct and material interference with the conduct of interstate commerce is settled doctrine. But the interference struck at must be direct and material, not some mere possibility contingent on wholly uncertain events; and there must be no impairment of rights guaranteed. A state by taxation on property may indirectly but seriously affect the cost of transportation; it may not lay a direct tax upon \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 100]\n\u00a0\n the receipts from interstate transportation. The first is an indirect effect, the other direct.\n This power to protect interstate commerce was invoked in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.(N. S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734, and United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632. In each of those cases a combination sought to monopolize and restrain interstate commerce through purchase and consequent control of many large competing concerns engaged both in manufacture and interstate commerce. The combination was sufficiently powerful and action by it so persistent that success became a dangerous probability. Here there is no such situation, and the cases are inapplicable in the circumstances. There is no conspiracy to interfere with commerce unless it can be said to exist among the employees who became members of the union. There is a single plant operated by its own management whose only offense, as alleged, was the discharge of a few employees in the production department because they belonged to a union, coming within the broad definition of 'labor organization' prescribed by section 2(5) of the act. That definition includes any organization in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose in whole or in part of dealing with employers concerning grievances, wages, &c.\n Section 13 of the Labor Act (29 U.S.C.A.  163) provides-'Nothing in this Act (chapter) shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike.' And yet it is ruled that to discharge an employee in a factory because he is a member of a labor organization (any kind) may create discontent which may lead to a strike and this may cause a block in the 'stream of commerce'; consequently the discharge may be inhibited. Thus the act exempts from its ambit the every evil which counsel insist may result from discontent caused by a discharge of an association member, but permits coercion of a nonmember to join one. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 101]\n\u00a0\n The things inhibited by the Labor Act relate to the management of a manufacturing plant-something distinct from commerce and subject to the authority of the state. And this may not be abridged because of some vague possibility of distant interference with commerce.\n\n\n IX.\n\n\n Texas & New Orleans Railroad Co. et al., v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks et al., \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 434, is not controlling. There the Court, while considering an act definitely limited to common carriers engaged in interstate transportation over whose affairs Congress admittedly has wide power, declared: 'The petitioners invoke the principle declared in Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161\n, 28 S.Ct. 277, 13 Ann.Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S.Ct. 240, L.R.A.1915C, 960, but these decisions are inapplicable. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the carrier to select its employees or to discharge them. The statute is not aimed at this right of the employers but at the interference with the right of employees to have representatives of their own choosing. As the carriers subject to the act have no constitutional right to interfere with the freedom of the employees in making their selections, they cannot complain of the statute on constitutional grounds.'\n Adair's Case, supra, presented the question-'May Congress make it a criminal offense against the United States-as, by the 10th section of the act of 1898 (30 Stat. 428), it does-for an agent or officer of an interstate carrier, having full authority in the premises from the carrier, to discharge an employee from service simply because of his membership in a labor organization?' The answer was no. 'While, as already suggested, the right of liberty and property guaranteed by the Constitution against deprivation without due process of law is subject to such reasonable restraints as the common good or the general welfare may \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 102]\n\u00a0\n require, it is not within the functions of government-at least, in the absence of contract between the parties-to compel any person, in the course of his business and against his will, to accept or retain the personal services of another, or to compel any person, against his will, to perform personal services for another. The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor or prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell it. So the right of the employee to quit the service of the employer, for whatever reason, is the same as the right of the employer, for whatever reason, to dispense with the services of such employee. It was the legal right of the defendant, Adair,-however unwise such a course might have been,-to discharge Coppage because of his being a member of a labor organization, as it was the legal right of Coppage, if he saw fit to do so, however unwise such course on his part might have been-to quit the service in which he was engaged, because the defendant employed some persons who were not members of a labor organization. In all such particulars the employer and the employee have equality of right, and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land.' 'The provision of the statute under which the defendant was convicted must be held to be repugnant to the 5th Amendment, and as not embraced by nor within the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, but, under the guise of regulating interstate commerce, and as applied to this case, it arbitrarily sanctions an illegal invasion of the personal liberty as well as the right of property of the defendant, Adair.'\n Coppage v. Kansas, following the Adair Case held that a state statute, declaring it a misdemeanor to require an \n\n[301 \nU.S. 58, 103]\n\u00a0\n employee to agree not to become a member of a labor organization during the time of his employment, was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The right to contract is fundamental and includes the privilege of selecting those with whom one is willing to assume contractual relations. This right is unduly abridged by the act now upheld. A private owner is deprived of power to manage his own property by freely selecting those to whom his manufacturing operations are to be entrusted. We think this cannot lawfully be done in circumstances like those here disclosed.\n It seems clear to us that Congress has Transcended the powers granted. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] National Labor Relations Act (Act of July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, U.S.C.Supp. I, tit. 29,  151 et seq.

Long, of Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In October, 1935, charges against the respondent, Fruehauf Trailer Company, were filed with the National Labor \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n Relations Board. The Board issued its complaints (in two cases) alleging that the Company was engaged in unfair labor practices as described in section 8, subdivisions (1) and (3), of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq. (29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.). The practices were said to consist in the discharge of, and threats to discharge, employees because of their affiliation with, and activity in, the labor organization known as United Automobile Workers Federal Labor Union No. 19375.\n Notice of hearing was given and the complaints were consolidated. Respondent appeared specially and filed motions to dismiss the complaints upon the ground that the Board was without jurisdiction and that the act as applied to respondent violated article 1, section 1, and the First, Fifth, Seventh and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. Answers were also filed, denying the charges and reserving the same jurisdictional and constitutional objections. Hearing was had. The Board received evidence upon the jurisdictional issue and, reaffirming an earlier ruling, denied the motions to dismiss. Hearing upon the merits proceeded, and in December, 1935, the Board made its findings and entered its order.\n The order required the respondent to cease and desist from discharging, or threatening to discharge, any of its employees because of their joining the Union; from employing detectives for the purpose of espionage within the Union; and from interfering in any other manner with or coercing its employees in the exercise of their right to self- organization for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection as guaranteed in section 7 of the act (29 U.S.C.A.  157). The order also required the respondent to cease and desist from discouraging membership in the Union or, in any other labor organization of its employees, by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment. Respondent was directed to offer reinstatement to the employees who had been discharged, to make good their \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n losses in pay, and to post for thirty days notices that it had complied with the order in ceasing the interferences set forth.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the petition of the Board to enforce its order and set the order aside. 85 F.(2d) 391. This Court granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 534\n, 57 S.Ct. 119, 81 L.Ed. --.\n With respect to the nature of respondent's business the Board made the following findings: Respondent is a corporation organized under the laws of Michigan and is engaged in the manufacture, assembly, sale, and distribution of commercial trailers and of trailer parts and accessories. The trailers are vehicles designed for the transportation of merchandise. Respondent's plant is located in Detroit and is the largest concern of its kind in the United States. Respondent maintains 31 branch sales offices in 12 different states and has distributors and dealers in the principal cities of the country. A wholly-owned subsidiary operates in Toronto, Canada, where sales are made and considerable assembly work is done with materials obtained from the Detroit plant and in Canada. More than 50 per cent. in value of the materials used by the respondent in manufacture, assembly and shipping during the year 1934 were transported to its Detroit plant from Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and other states. Most of the lumber was transported from southern states and most of the finished parts were transported from states other than Michigan. In 1934, respondent's sales amounted to $3,318,000. Its nearest competitor sold only 37 per cent. of that amount. More than 80 per cent. of its sales are of products shipped outside the state of Michigan through and to other states and to foreign countries. Between January 1 and November 1, 1935, 112 carloads of respondent's products were shipped to points outside the state of Michigan by railroad and 400 to 500 trailers with accessories were hauled over the highways by motor trucks or tractors to \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n points outside the state. About 30 chassis a day are finished at the Detroit plant of which 80 per cent. are started on their way to destinations outside Michigan. In connection with its interstate sales, respondent furnishes service in the determination of customers' needs and assists in the laying out of special construction requirements. Respondent's sales of trailers in Canada are accomplished through its Canadian subsidiary, and its sales it states other than Michigan are made through its branch sales offices and its distributors and dealers. It is a practice of respondent to consign trailers and parts to distributors and dealers in various states with title retained in respondent until payment is made. The manufacturing and assembly operations at the Detroit plant are essentially connected with and dependent upon the purchase, sales and distribution operations without the state of Michigan. The findings also describe various features of respondent's manufacturing and distributing activities.\n With respect to the alleged unfair labor practices, the Board found in substance as follows: The United Automobile Workers Federal Labor Union No. 19375 had been organized among the production and maintenance employees of respondent's Detroit plant and, at the time of the occurrences described, included 177 active members and about 100 members who at one time or another paid dues and did not usually attend meetings. The production and maintenance men at respondent's factory at that time numbered about 400. Early in 1934, respondent hired a detective whose duty it was 'to ferret out the union activities of the men' and to keep the respondent informed. This, as the respondent's vice president stated, was to avoid trouble and 'to keep a steady flow of business.' For purposes of deception, and in order to make the detective eligible for membership in the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n Union, respondent gave him employment. He joined the Union and became its treasurer. He thus obtained a list of all the members of the Union. He made frequent reports to respondent and with the lists thus obtained respondent's superintendent went about the factory from time to time and warned various employees against union activities. The result of these measures 'caused suspicion, unrest and confusion among the employees.' A subforeman, who was later discharged, was urged by the superintendent to resign his office in the Union and work with the superintendent 'to see that the Union did not gain strength in the plant.' The subforeman, who interviewed applicants for work, was also instructed by his foreman to learn whether they belonged to a union or believed in unionism and was told that, if they did, they would be objectionable. Respondent 'determined to put a stop to all attempts on the part of its factory workers to form an efficient independent bargaining agency and in furtherance of that purpose summarily discharged nine men and threatened three others with discharge.' Two of the men were discharged before the act became effective.\n The Board found: 'As to the remaining seven men who were discharged, the evidence is found principally in the testimony of the discharged men and other employees. There was no credible or substantial contradictioin of this testimony. Our conclusions as to the unfair labor practices charged are reached after a consideration of such evidence and argument as were offered by the respondent, who failed to produce witnesses in its own employ obviously having knowledge of the facts surrounding these discharges, and who in its brief does not argue that its conduct did not constitute unfair labor practices.'\n The Board reviewed the particular cases of discharge and found that, in each, the employee was discharged be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 56]\n\u00a0\n cause he joined and assisted the Union. The Board found that as a result of the discharges the members of the Union were coerced and restrained from any attempt to organize for collective bargaining; that respondent's acts 'led to confusion, resentment, and bitterness among the employees, and tended to lead to a labor dispute burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of commerce' between Michigan and other states and foreign countries.\n Respondent, on its part, traces the history of the development of its business from its small beginnings, emphasizing the outstanding success of its enterprise. Respondent criticizes the finding as to the number of its employees who were members of the Union and states there was no proper basis for the finding that there were only 400 employees in the manufacturing and production departments. Respondent contends that the testimony negatived any showing of labor difficulties and that since its first operations there had not been a strike at the plant which hampered its operations. It is also urged that it was not shown that the discharges caused a strike at the plant or delay in operations. Respondent points to evidence that only 35 men voted for a strike out of a total of 700 production and manufacturing employees; that only 67 employees voted at the Union meeting; and that the suggestion of a strike was voted down. Respondent contends that the testimony of its vice president showed that, in discharging and laying off men during a slack period of production, the same standard was applied to Union and non-Union men, the determining factors 'being the efficiency of the workmen, his cooperation and whether or not he appeared to have the Company's best interests at heart in performing his duties.'\n Counsel for respondent in their brief state that 'Respondent called no witnesses and offered no proof on the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 49, 57]\n\u00a0\n question of alleged unfair labor practices, except that brought on cross- examination of discharged employees and from witness Vosler (its vice president) called by the Board on this phase of the case. The Company at all times relied upon its position that the Board had neither jurisdiction over the subject matter of these proceedings, nor over the person of Respondent, that the Act, as a whole, was invalid and the attempted application thereof by the Board to respondent in these proceedings was unconstitutional.'\n The Board in its findings stated that respondent's witness, Vosler, testified that 'he knew none of the facts' surrounding any of the discharges 'of his own knowledge' and the Board commented upon the failure of respondent to produce the foreman, or the superintendent, who were in a position to contradict the statement of employees, if they could be contradicted, with respect to the reasons for the discharge.\n We have examined respondent's contentions and we are of the opinion that the findings of the Board, with respect to the nature of the respondent's business and the circumstances of the discharges complained of, are supported by the evidence.\n The questions relating to the construction and validity of the act have been fully discussed in our opinion in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed . --, decided this day. We hold that the principles there stated are applicable here. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent.

The proceeding was brought to fix rates charged for gas sold in Illinois by the Chicago District Pipe Line Company, an affiliated corporation.\n Appellant, a Delaware corporation, sells in Illinois natural gas, which it transports through its pipe lines from Oklahoma to points in Illinois where, pursuant to a longterm contract, it delivers the gas to the District Company, an Illinois corporation. The latter is engaged in intrastate commerce in Illinois where it sells the gas, which it purchases from appellant, to other companies which in turn distribute the gas to consumers within the state. The rates of the District Company are subject to regulation by the commission, as provided by the Illinois Public Utilities Act (Ill.Rev.Stat. c. 111 2\/3,  1 et seq.). All its shares of stock are owned by the Natural Gas Investment Company, an Illinois corporation, which owns 26.63 per cent. of the outstanding shares of appellant.

The commission has found that the president of the District Company is president and director of the Investment Company and a director of appellant, and that a director of the District Company and of the Investment Company is a vice president and director of appellant.\n Section 8a(2) of the Illinois Public Utilities Act, Ill.Rev.Stat.1937, c. 111 2\/3,  8a(2) gives the commission jurisdiction over 'affiliated interests having transactions, other than ownership of stock and receipt of dividends \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n thereon, with public utilities under the jurisdiction of the commission, to the extent of access to all accounts and records of such affiliated interests relating to such transactions, ... and to the extent of authority to require such reports with respect to such transactions to be submitted by such affiliated interests, as the commission may prescribe.' The subsection defines 'affiliated interests' as meaning:\n'(c) Every corporation, ten per centum or more of whose voting capital stock is owned by any person or corporation owning ten per centum or more of the voting capital stock of such public utility; ...\n\n'(f) Every corporation which has one or more elective officers or one or more directors in common with such public utility.'1\n\n In November, 1936, the commission, in the exercise of its authority under the act, began a proceeding to which the District Company was, and appellant was not, a party, to determine whether the rates charged by the District Company should be reduced. After hearing evidence, the commission found that appellant was an affiliate of the District Company and that in order to fix reasonable rates for the sale of gas by the latter, inquiry was \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n necessary into its operating charges including the cost of gas purchased from appellant. The commission accordingly made an order, the validity of which is assailed here, directing that appellant make available for examination by the commission all of its accounts and records relating to transactions between it and the District Company. It further ordered that appellant file with the commission a report of the cost of property used in, and a statement of income and expenses in connection with, supplying gas to the District Company; or, in the alternative, that it report to the commission a statement of the cost of all properties used by it in the business of transporting and selling natural gas, together with a statement of the income and expenses of such operations.\n In the present suit in equity, brought in the District Court for Northern Illinois, petitioner prayed that appellees be enjoined from enforcing the order and that it be set aside as made without authority of state law, and on the further grounds that the statute and order are invalid because they violate the commerce, equal protection, and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution. The case comes here on appeal, Judicial Code,  266 (as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  380), from the order of the District Court of three judges, which denied an interlocutory injunction. It held that appellant had failed to show that the order infringed any constitutional immunity or that appellant would suffer irreparable injury by reason of the action of the commission.\n The court thought that the commission, in conducting the pending rate proceeding, and in investigating the reasonableness of the operating costs of the District Company, was entitled to the information it sought, which might be disclosed by an examination of appellant's accounts and records; that for that purpose the commission would have been entitled to compel their production by subpoena; and that as appellant had failed \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n to present to the commission any objection to the breadth of the order, or to the use of an order rather than a subpoena to secure the information, no case was made for the interposition of a court of equity.\n First. The appellant assails the statute as unconstitutional so far as it authorizes the commission to obtain from appellant's books and records any information bearing upon the reasonableness of the price of gas sold to the District Company. Appellant recognizes that the absence of 'arm's length bargaining' between contracting affiliates is sufficient to support such an inquiry, and may be an adequate ground, in fixing the reasonable rates of a public utility company, for disregarding the price at which it purchases the commodity distributed. See Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n285 \nU.S. 119\n, 52 S.Ct. 283. But it is said that here the statute infringes the commerce clause (article 1 ,  8, cl. 3) and the Fourteenth Amendment because it authorizes the inquiry without proof of common control or want of arm's length bargaining; that the Constitution forbids all inquiry as to the relations between he two companies and the prices at which the gas is sold by one to the other, in advance of proof of their common control or other evidence that the bargaining was not at arm's length. Assuming, without deciding, that the breadth of this attack relieves appellant of the necessity of applying to the commission to vacate its order before seeking equitable relief in the federal courts, see Hollis v. Kutz, \n255 \nU.S. 452\n, 41 S.Ct. 371; cf. United States v. Sing Tuck, \n194 \nU.S. 161, 167\n, 24 S.Ct. 621, we think that the objection is not substantial.\n We can find in the commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment no basis for saying that any person is immune from giving information appropriate to a legislative or judicial inquiry. A foreign corporation engaged exclusively in interstate commerce within he state is amenable to process there as are citizens and corporations \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n engaged in local business. International Harvester Company v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 579\n, 34 S.Ct. 944. It is similarly subject to garnishment and writ of attachment. Davis v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co., \n217 \nU.S. 157\n, 30 S.Ct. 463, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 823, 18 Ann.Cas. 907. It can be deemed to be no less subject, on command of a state tribunal, to the duty to give information appropriate to an inquiry pending there. The present investigation is not a regulation of interstate commerce and it burdens the commerce no more than the obligation owed by all, even those engaged in interstate commerce, to comply with local laws and ordinances, which do not impede the free flow of commerce, where Congress has not acted. Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465\n, 8 S.Ct. 564; Red 'C' Oil Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n222 \nU.S. 380\n, 32 S.Ct. 152; Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard), \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 402-412, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N. S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm., \n296 \nU.S. 261\n, 56 S.Ct. 194, and cases cited.\n This Court has often recognized that the reasonableness of the price at which a public utility company buys the product which it sells is an appropriate subjct of investigation when the resale rates are under consideration, and that any relationship between the buyer and seller which tends to prevent arm's length dealing may have an important bearing on the reasonableness of the selling price. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm. of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 320\n, 49 S.Ct. 150, 156; Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 144\n, 51 S.Ct. 65, 67; Wstern Distributing Co. v. Public Service Comm., supra, \n285 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 52 S.Ct. 283, 284; Dayton Light & Power Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290\n, 54 S.Ct. 647. We have not said, nor do we perceive any ground for saying, that the Constitution requires such an inquiry to be limited to those cases where common control of the two corporations is secured through ownership of a majority of their voting stock. We are not unaware that, as the statute recognizes,2 there are other methods of control of a corpora- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n tion than through such ownership. Common management of corporations through officers or directors, or common ownership of a substantial amount, though less than a majority of their stock, gives such indication of unified control as to call for close scrutiny of a contract between them whenever the reasonableness of its terms is the subject of inquiry. In these circumstances, appellant can hardly object to the attempted inquiry into the fairness of the price. Cf. Corsicana National Bank v. Johnson, \n251 \nU.S. 68, 90\n, 40 S.Ct. 82, 91, and cases cited; Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., \n254 \nU.S. 590, 599\n, 41 S.Ct. 209, 212; Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Comm., supra, \n285 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 52 S.Ct. 283, 284; Globe Woolen Co. v. Utica Gas & Elec. Co., 224 N.Y. 483, 121 N.E. 378. The price itself may be found to be so exorbitant as to persuade that the bargaining was not at arm's length. Corsicana National Bank v. Johnson, supra. We cannot say that the Illinois statute is subject to any constitutional infirmity in so far as it demands access to the books and accounts of appellant or requires production of the information which the order seeks.\n Second. Appellant also challenges the order of the commission as a first step in the direction of unconstitutional action. But appellant is not a party to the pending proceeding, whose ultimate concern is the rates of the District Company. In that proceeding the commission can make no order binding on appellant with respect to its own rates or its contract. Cf. State Corporation Comm. v. Wichita Gas Co., \n290 \nU.S. 561\n, 54 S.Ct. 321. There is no contention that the commission threatens to make any order modifying or cancelling either. The statute does not prescribe the effect which the commission is to give to the information sought. Assuming, without deciding, that it cannot rightly be made the basis for disregarding the price at which appellant sells gas to the District Company, unless as the result of the inquiry there ap- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n pears to be in some form an effective single control of the two companies, we cannot also assume that the commission will arbitrarily make such use of it in fixing the District Company's rates. It will be time enough to challenge such action of the commission when it is taken or at least threatened, First National Bank v. Albright, \n208 \nU.S. 548\n, 28 S.Ct. 349; Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation Comm., \n236 \nU.S. 699\n, 35 S.Ct. 480, and to consider whether appellant has standing to make the challenge. The commission is not to be enjoined from seeking information whose probable usefulness is established, as it is in this case, by the statutory prerequisite of partial community of management or stock ownership.\n Third. Appellant urges that, in requireing statistical reports, the expense of whose preparation is said to be great, the order transcends statutory authority, or exercises it so arbitrarily as to place an unconstitutional burden on commerce and infringe the Fourteenth Amendment. It is said that equity alone can afford adequate relief because of the cumulative penalties for failure to comply with the order. See sections 76 and 77 of the act (Ill.Rev.Stat.1937, 1937, c. 111 2\/3,  80, 81).\n We have no occasion to consider the merits of these objections. It suffices to say that the statute itself provides an adequate administrative remedy which appellant has not sought. By sections 64 and 65 of the act (Ill.Rev.Stat.1937, c. 111 2\/3,  68, 69), the commission was authorized on its own motion or on application of appellant to order a hearing to ascertain whether the present order was 'improper, unreasonable or contrary to law.' Section 67 (Ill.Rev.Stat.1937, c. 111 2\/3,  71) authorizes the commission at any time, upon proper notice and hearing, to 'rescind, alter or amend any ... order or decision made by it.' We see no reason, and appellant suggests none, for redjecting the trial court's ruling that the commission, if asked, could have modified its order, or for concluding that the commission was without authority to suspend or postpone \n\n[302 \nU.S. 300, 310]\n\u00a0\n the date of the effective operation of the order so as to avoid the running of penalties, pending application for its modification. Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 470\n, 52 S.Ct. 617, 620; Id., \n287 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 132.\n As the act imposes penalties of from $500 to $2,000 a day for failure to comply with the order, any application of the statute subjecting appellant to the risk of the cumulative penalties pending an attempt to test the validity of the order in the courts and for a reasonable time after decision, would be a denial of due process, Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 147\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 340, 349\n, 33 S.Ct. 961; see Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 659\n, 35 S. Ct. 214, but no reason appears why appellant could not have asked the commission to postpone the date of operation of the order pending application to the commission for modification. Refusal of postponement would have been the occasion for recourse to the courts. Compare Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 43 S.Ct. 353, 354; with Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210\n, 29 S.Ct. 67; Ex parte Young, supra, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 156\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764. But appellant did not ask postponement.\n A temporary injunction was not necessary to protect appellant from penalties pending final determination of the suit. The commission agreed not to enforce the order before the decision of the lower court on the application for interlocutory injunction. In order to give appellant opportunity to appeal here, the District Court stayed, for thirty days, its order denying an injunction, and by an order of a Justice of this Court the operation of the commission's order and the running of penalties were enjoined pending the disposition of the cause here.\n The rule that a suitor must exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking the extraordinary relief of a court of equity, Goldsmith v.

Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm., \n290 \nU.S. 264, 271\n, 54 S.Ct. 154, 157; De Giovanni v. Camden Fire Ins. Ass'n, \n296 \nU.S. 64\n, 56 S.Ct. 1, and the objection has been taken by the trial court. Matthews v. Rodgers, supra.\n The extent to which a federal court may rightly relax the rule where the order of the administrative body is assailed in its entirety, rests in the sound discretion which guides exercise of equity jurisdiction. Hollis v. Kutz, supra; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 282\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 567; cf. United States v. Sing Tuck, supra. But there are cogent reasons for requiring resort in the first instance to the administrative tribunal when the particular method by which it has chosen to exercise authority, a matter peculiarly within its competence, is also under attack, for there is the possibility of removal of these issues from the case by modification of its order. Here the commission had authority to pass upon every question raised by the appellant and was able to modify the order. In such circumstances, the trial court is free to withhold its aid entirely until administrative remedies have been exhausted.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 8(a)(2) also provides that 'affiliated interests' mean:\n'(g) Every corporation or person which the commission may determine as a matter of fact after investigation and hearing is actually exercising any substantial influence over the policies and actions of such public utility even though such influence is not based upon stock holding, stockholders, directors or officers to the extent specified in this section.\n\n'(h) Every person or corporation who or which the commission may determine as a matter of fact after investigation and hearing is actually exercising such substantial influence over the policies and actions of such public utility in conjunction with one or more other corporations or persons with which or whom they are related by ownership or blood relationship or by action in concert that together they are affiliated with such public utility within the meaning of this section even though no one of them alone is so affiliated.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See footnote 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK LIFE INS.

The debtor answered, seeking approval of the petition. Members of a bondholders' protective committee, holding bonds issued by the corporation, filed a response to the petition, alleging that it was not filed in good faith and asking that it be disapproved and dismissed. Petitioners replied. After allowing thirty days to afford an opportunity to ascertain the possibility of the submission of a feasible plan of reorganization, the District Court, upon hearing, dismissed the petition as insufficient to meet the requirements of section 77B.\n  The District Court allowed an appeal upon the giving of a bond and the appeal was perfected accordingly. The appellees moved to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that it was unauthorized by law as it had not been allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court granted the motion and the appeal was dismissed. We issued a writ of certiorari (\n299 \nU.S. 536\n) November 16, 1936.\n  Paragraph (k) of section 77B (11 \nU.S.C.A.  207(k) provides that the other sections of the Bankruptcy Act shall apply to proceedings under section 77B, unless inconsistent with it, and that 'the date of the order approving the petition or answer under this section shall be taken to be the date of adjudication, and such order shall have the same consequences and effect as an order of adjudication.' The effect of this provision is to make sections 24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended (11 \nU.S.C.A .  47, 48) applicable to appeals from orders and judgments entered in proceedings under section 77B.\n  Section 25(a), 11 \nU.S.C.A.  48(a), provides that appeals, as in equity cases, may be taken in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy to the Circuit Courts of Appeals in the cases enumerated, the first of which is, 'from a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant \n\n[300 \nU.S. 26\n, 28]\n\u00a0\n a bankrupt.' While paragraph (k), 11 \nU.S.C.A.  207(k), refers to 'the order approving the petition or answer' under section 77B, which is to have 'the same consequences and effect as an order of adjudication,' we think that to carry out the manifest intent of the statute, an order disapproving the petition or answer under section 77B should have the same effect for the purpose of appeal as an order refusing adjudication. Interpreting the statute in that sense, we said in Meyer v. Kenmore Hotel Co., \n297 \nU.S. 160, 163\n, 164, 406: 'The appeal provisions of sections 24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended 11 \nU.S. C.A.  47, 48, are thus made applicable to orders entered in the course of a reorganization proceeding, and an order approving or disapproving a petition for reorganization is made the equivalent, at least for purposes of an appeal under section 25 a, of a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt. By section 24 a and section 24 b appeals in 'proceedings' in bankruptcy, as distinguished from appeals in 'controversies arising in bankruptcy,' may be taken only on leave granted in the discretion of the appellate court, except that in the cases enumerated in section 25 a, including, in clause (1), 'a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt,' an appeal may be taken as of right.'\n  The instant case is not one where the petition had been approved and the appeal was from a subsequent order denying an application to dismiss the proceeding or from an order confirming or refusing to confirm a plan of reorganization. See Meyer v. Kenmore Hotel Co., supra, \n297 \nU.S. 160\n, at pages 161, 162, 164, 166, 406, 407. Humphrey v. Bankers Mortgage Co. (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 345, 349, 350. The appeal is from a judgment which disapproved and dismissed the petition and should be treated as in the same category as an appeal from a judgment refusing to adjudicate the defendant a bankrupt and hence as appealable under \n\n[300 \nU.S. 26\n, 29]\n\u00a0\n section 25(a). The Circuit Court of Appeals should have entertained the appeal and disposed of it upon the merits.\n  The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n  Reversed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOCEAN CITY v.

Metcalf, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The rates chargeable by the appellant, the Ohio Bell Telephone Company, for intrastate telephone service to subscribers and patrons in Ohio are the subject-matter of this controversy. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n Appellant was reorganized in September, 1921, by consolidation with the Ohio State Telephone Company, till then a competitor. Soon afterwards it filed with the Public Utilities Commission of the state schedules of new rates to be charged in those communities where an increase was desired for the unified service. Except in the case of toll charges the rates were not state-wide, but were separately stated for each of the company's exchanges, of which there were many. By the statutes then in force (the Robinson law, passed December 19, 1919, 108 Ohio Laws, p. 1094, as amended by the Pence law, passed April 4, 1923, 110 Ohio Laws, p. 366), the operation of an increase might be suspended for 120 days, at the end of which time the rate was to go into effect upon the filing of a bond for the repayment to consumers of such portion of the increased rate as the Commission upon final hearing should determine to have been excessive, with interest thereon. Construing these statutes the Ohio courts have held that a refund must be limited to rates collected under a bond, jurisdiction being disclaimed when that condition was not satisfied. City of Lima v. Public Utilities Commission, 106 Ohio St. 379, 386, 140 N.E. 147; Great Miami Valley Taxpayers Ass'n v. Public Utilities Commission, 131 Ohio St. 285, 286, 2 N.E.(2d) 777. Some of the new exchange schedules were the subject of protests, and in proceedings to revise them (known as Pence Law proceedings) were made effective by bonds, a separate one for each exchange. Protest was also aimed at the new schedule for toll service which was to apply throughout the state. On the other hand, schedules for other exchanges became effective without protest and therefore without bond, and are not now at issue.\n By October 1924, thirty-one Pence Law proceedings aimed at separate exchanges had been begun, but had not been fully tried. Already several thousand pages of testi- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n mony had been taken and many exhibits received in evidence. Soon afterwards, twelve additional proceedings were begun, making the total number forty-three, exclusive of the toll case. Two other proceedings were started later on. While the number stood at forty-three, the Commission of its own motion, by order dated October 14, 1924, directed a company-wide investigation of appellant's property and rates, and consolidated the bond cases therewith. The order recites that in all the pending proceedings the important issues are identical, and that a single consolidated case will enable rates to be determined for all services within the state at a minimum expenditure of time and money. Accordingly, the company was required to file with the Commission on or before December 1, 1924, a complete inventory of all its property, used and useful in its business, and upon the filing of such inventory, the consolidated case was to 'proceed to a hearing for the determination of the fair value of said property and of the just and reasonable rates for the service thereby to be furnished by said company to its patrons throughout the state of Ohio.' The state-wide investigation thus initiated, as distinguished from the Pence Law proceedings consolidated therewith, had its legal basis in provisions of the General Code of Ohio (section 499-8, 499-9), and its scope was confined to the rates chargeable in the future (section 614-23), the Pence Law being the basis for any refund of rates collected in the past. The statute (section 499-9) makes it mandatory that in fixing rates for the future, the Commission shall ascertain the value of the property as 'of a date certain' to be named. The date adopted for that purpose was June 30, 1925\n\n\n The company filed an inventory as required by the Commission with supplemental inventories every six months thereafter showing additions and retirements. A long investigation followed, the evidence being directed \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n in the main to the value of the property on the basis of historical cost and cost of reproduction, and to the deductions chargeable to gross revenues for depreciation reserve and operating expenses generally. As early as February, 1927, the case was submitted to the Commission for the fixing of a tentative value as of the date certain, a tentative value being subject under the Ohio Code to protest and readjustment. At the request of the Attorney General, however, the proceeding was reopened and new evidence introduced. At last, on January 10, 1931, the Commission announced its tentative conclusion. The valuation then arrived at was $104, 282,735, for all the property within the state, whether used in interstate or in intrastate business. Protests were filed both by the company and by the state and municipalities. They were followed by new hearings. On January 16, 1934, the Commission made its findings and order setting forth what purports to be a final valuation. The intrastate property as of June 30, 1925, was valued at $93,707,488; the total property, interstate and intrastate, at $96,422,276.\n The Commission did not confine itself, however, to a valuation of the property as of the date certain. It undertook also to fix a valuation for each of the years 1926 to 1933 inclusive. For this purpose it took judicial notice of price trends during those years, modifying the value which it had found as of the date certain by the percentage of decline or rise applicable to the years thereafter. The first warning that it would do this came in 1934 with the filing of its report. 'The trend of land valuation was ascertained', according to the findings, 'from examination of the tax value in communities where the company had its largest real estate holdings.' 'For building trends resort was had to price indices of the Engineering News Record, a recognized magazine in the field \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n of engineering construction.' 'Labor trends were developed from the same sources.' Reference was made also to the findings of a federal court in Illinois (Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Gilbert (D.C.) 3 F.Supp. 595, 603) as to the price levels upon sales of apparatus and equipment by Western Electric, an affiliated corporation. The findings were not in evidence, though much of the testimony and exhibits on which they rested had been received by stipulation for certain limited purposes, and mainly to discover whether the prices paid to the affiliate were swollen beyond reason.* Cf. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 650. The Commission consulted these findings as indicative of market trends and learned upon them heavily. By resort to these and cognate sources, the value at the beginning of 1926 was fixed at 98.73% of the value at the date certain; the 1927 value at 95.7%; the 1928 value at 95%; the 1929 value at 96.3%; the 1930 value at 92.2%; the 1931 value at 86.6%; the 1932 value at 76.8%; the 1933 value at 79.1%. Upon that basis the company was found to have been in receipt of excess earnings of $13,289,172, distributed as follows: for 1925, $1,822,647; for 1926, $2,041,483; for 1927, $1,986,610; for 1928 , $1,925,301; for 1929, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n $1,463,347; for 1930, $1,481,689; for 1931, $1,659,760; for 1932, $908,335; for 1933, nothing. The excess was arrived at by figuring a return of 7% upon the value as a reasonable rate for the years 1925 to 1929, inclusive; 6.5% for the years 1930 and 1931; and 5.5% for the years 1932 and 1933. There being no excess revenue for the year 1933, the last year covered by the report, the Commission did not fix any percentage of reduction for the rates in future years. It did, however, prescribe a refund of the full amount of the excess for the years in which excess earnings were found to have been realized. The state-wide proceeding to fix rates for the future on the basis of a date certain was thus transformed finally into a refund proceeding, similar in function to proceedings under the Pence law for the refund of charges collected under bonds. The report of the Commission determining the excess was signed by a majority of the members, the Chairman dissenting. It was accompanied by an order similar in tenor.\n The company protested and moved for a rehearing. In its protest it stated that the trend percentage accepted in the findings as marking a decline in values did not come from any official sources which the Commission had the right to notice judicially; that they had not been introduced in evidence; that the company had not been given an opportunity to explain or rebut them; and that by their use the Commission had denied a fair hearing in contravention of the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. Demand was made that an opportunity be conceded for explanation and rebuttal; demand was made also that the company be permitted to submit evidence showing separately for each year the fair value of its property, its revenues, expenses and net income in each of the several cases wherein rates had been collected under bond. This last was a renewal of a demand which had been made several times in the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n course of the inquiry, as the Commission in its report concedes. By order dated March 1, 1934, the protests were overruled, and the demands rejected. By order dated July 5 of the same year the Commission modified to some extent its findings as to the excess income referable to bonded rates, and directed the company to show cause why refunds of the excess should not be made upon that basis. Again there was protest with a renewal of the request that evidence be received along the lines already indicated. Again the Commission reaffirmed its previous position.\n The outcome of these manoeuvres was the filing of a final order, dated September 6, 1934, apportioning the excess income between bonded and non-bonded rates by allocating to the former class a total of $11,423,137 for exchange subscribers and $409,127 for toll patrons (in all $11,832,264) and directing payment accordingly. Distribution was to be made among the several exchanges upon the basis of the percentage relation of the gross exchange revenues in the exchanges where bonds were in effect to the total gross exchange revenues, bonded and unbonded. If even a single rate in a particular exchange, e.g., in the city of Cleveland, had been collected under bond, all the revenues of that exchange were included in reckoning the percentage of the total that should go to the Cleveland customers. So much of the excess as was not used up in that way was apportioned to the tolls. This method of allocation was made the subject of another protest, the company insisting that it was arbitrary and unequal and a denial of due process. Petitions in error were filed with the Supreme Court of Ohio in accordance with the state practice (General Code,  544 et seq.) to review the final order of September 6, 1934, and the several intermediate orders supporting it. There was timely and adequate assertion of the infringe- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n ment of the petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed with an opinion per curiam. 131 Ohio St. 539, 3 N.E.(2d) 475. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344).\n First. The fundamentals of a trial were denied to the appellant when rates previously collected were ordered to be refunded upon the strength of evidential facts not spread upon the record.\n The Commission had given notice that the value of the property would be fixed as of a date certain. Evidence directed to the value at that time had been laid before the triers of the facts in thousands of printed pages. To make the picture more complete, evidence had been given as to the value at cost of additions and retirements. Without warning or even the hint of warning that the case would be considered or determined upon any other basis than the evidence submitted, the Commission cut down the values for the years after the date certain upon the strength of information secretly collected and never yet disclosed. The company protested. It asked disclosure of the documents indicative of price trends, and an opportunity to examine them, to analyze them, to explain and to rebut them. The response was a curt refusal. Upon the strength of these unknown documents refunds have been ordered for sums mounting into millions, the Commission reporting its conclusion, but not the underlying proofs. The putative debtor does not know the proofs today. This is not the fair hearing essential to due process. It is condemnation without trial.\n An attempt was made by the Commission and again by the state court to uphold this decision without evidence as an instance of judicial notice. Indeed, decisions of this court were cited (Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 301]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248, 260\n, 52 S.Ct. 146, 149; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, supra, \n292 \nU.S. 290\n, at page 311, 54 S.Ct. 647, 657; Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 274\n, 275 S., 54 S.Ct. 154, 158) as giving support to the new doctrine that the values of land and labor and buildings and equipment, with all their yearly fluctuations, no longer call for evidence. Our opinions have been much misread if they have been thought to point that way. Courts take judicial notice of matters of common knowledge. 5 Wigmore, Evidence,  2571, 2580, 2583; Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, pp. 277, 302. They take judicial notice that there has been a depression, and that a decline of market values is one of its concomitants. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, supra; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, supra; Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, supra. How great the decline has been for this industry or that, for one material or another, in this year or the next, can be known only to the experts, who may even differ among themselves. For illustration, a court takes judicial notice of the fact that Confederate money depreciated in value during the war between the states (Wood v. Cooper, 2 Heisk. (Tenn.) 441, 447; Hix v. Hix, 25 W.Va. 481, 484, 485), but not of the extent of the depreciation at a given time and place. Modawell v. Holmes, 40 Ala. 391, 405. Cf. Feemster v. Ringo, 5 T. B. Mun. (Ky.), 336, 337; Baxter v. McDonnell, 155 N.Y. 83, 93, 49 N.E. 667, 40 L.R.A. 670. The distinction is the more important in cases where as here the extent of the fluctuations is not collaterally involved but is the very point in issue. Moreover, notice, even when taken, has no other effect than to relieve one of the parties to a controversy of the burden of resorting to the usual forms of evidence. Wigmore, Evidence,  2567; 1 Greenleaf, Evidence, (16th Ed.) p. 18. 'It does not \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 302]\n\u00a0\n mean that the opponent is prevented from disputing the matter by evidence if he believes it disputable.' Ibid. Cf. Shapleigh v. Mier (Jan. 4, 1937) \n299 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 261. Such at least is the general rule, to be adhered to in the absence of exceptional conditions. Here the contention would be futile that the precise amount of the decline in values was so determinate or notorious in each and every year between 1925 and 1933 as to be beyond the range of question. So much is indeed conceded on the face of the report itself. No rational concept of notoriety will include these variable elements. True, the category is not a closed one. 'The precedents of former judges, in declining to notice or assenting to notice specific facts, do not restrict the present judge from noticing a new fact, provided only that the new fact is notorious to the community.' 5 Wigmore, Evidence,  2583. Even so, to press the doctrine of judicial notice to the extent attempted in this case and to do that retroactively after the case had been submitted, would be to turn the doctrine into a pretext for dispensing with a trial.\n What was done by the Commission is subject, however, to an objection even deeper. Cf. Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 \nU.S. 172, 174\n, 175 S., 20 S.Ct. 77; West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258, 262\n, 263 S., 24 S.Ct. 650. There has been more than an expansion of the concept of notoriety beyond reasonable limits. From the standpoint of due process-the protection of the individual against arbitrary action-a deeper vice is this, that even now we do not know the particular or evidential facts of which the Commission took judicial notice and on which it rested its conclusion. Not only are the facts unknown; there is no way to find them out. When price lists or trade journals or even government reports are put in evidence upon a trial, the party against whom they are offered may see the evidence or hear it and parry its effect. Even if they are copied in the findings without \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 303]\n\u00a0\n preliminary proof, there is at least an opportunity in connection with a judicial review of the decision to challenge the deductions made from them. The opportunity is excluded here. The Commission, withholding from the record the evidential facts that it has gathered here and there, contents itself with saying that in gathering them it went to journals and tax lists, as if a judge were to tell us, 'I looked at the statistics in the Library of Congress, and they teach me thus and so.' This will never do if hearings and appeals are to be more than empty forms.\n We have pointed out elsewhere that under the statutes of Ohio no provision is made for a review of the order of the Commission by a separate or independent suit. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), \n294 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 319. A different question would be here if such a suit could be maintained with an intermediate suspension of the administrative ruling. Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 470\n, 471 S., 52 S.Ct. 617, 620; United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., \n291 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 54 S. Ct. 471, 473; Nickey v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 393, 396\n, 54 S. Ct. 743, 744; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 39 S.Ct. 62. Cf. Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 318\n, 319 S., 53 S.Ct. 350, 359. In Ohio the sole method of review is by petition in error to the Supreme Court of the State, which considers both the law and the facts upon the record made below, and not upon new evidence. In such circumstances judicial review would be no longer a reality if the practice followed in this case were to receive the stamp of regularity. To put the problem more concretely: how was it possible for the appellate court to review the law and the facts and intelligently decide that the findings of the Commission were supported by the evidence when the evidence that it approved was unknown and unknowable? In expressing that approval the court did not mean that traveling beyond the record, it had consulted price lists for itself and had reached its \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 304]\n\u00a0\n own conclusion as to the percentage of decline in value from 1925 onwards. It did not even mean that it had looked at the particular lists made use of by the Commission, for no one knows what they were in any precise or certain way. Nowhere in the opinion is there even the hint of such a search. What the Supreme Court of Ohio did was to take the word of the Commission as to the outcome of a secret investigation, and let it go at that. 'A hearing is not judicial, at least in any adequate sense, unless the evidence can be known.' West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1) supra, \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, at page 69, 55 S.Ct. 316, 319. Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. Ry. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569; Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 264 S., 265, 44 S.Ct. 317, 318, 319.\n Regulatory commissions have been invested with broad powers within the sphere of duty assigned to them by law. Even in quasi-judicial proceedings their informed and expert judgment exacts and receives a proper deference from courts when it has been reached with due submission to constitutional restraints. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), supra, \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, at page 70, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 2), \n294 \nU.S. 79\n, 55 S.Ct. 324; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission of California, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643. Indeed, much that they do within the realm of administrative discretion is exempt from supervision if those restraints have been obeyed. All the more insistent is the need, when power has been bestowed so freely, that the 'inexorable safeguard' (St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 73\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 735) of a fair and open hearing be maintained in its integrity. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 481 S., 56 S.Ct. 906, 911; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. Ry. Co., supra. The right to such a hearing is one of 'the rudiments of fair play' (Chicago, M . & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Polt, 232 U.S. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 305]\n\u00a0\n 165, 168, 34 S.Ct. 301) assured to every litigant by the Fourteenth Amendment as a minimal requirement. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), (No. 2), supra; Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 682\n, 50 S.Ct. 451, 454. Cf. Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, supra. There can be no compromise on the footing of convenience or expediency, or because of a natural desire to be rid of harassing delay, when that minimal requirement has been neglected or ignored.\n In an endeavor to sustain the judgment the state shifts its line of argument from the course pursued below, so far, at least, as the course then followed is reflected in the record. Both the Commission and the Supreme Court of Ohio tell us that they have applied the price trends to the value on the day certain by resort to judicial notice. The state now suggests that whatever the court or the Commission may have professed to be doing, there was a basis in the evidence for the conclusion ultimately reached. To give aid to that suggestion reference is made to the findings of a federal court as to the prices charged by Western Electric for telephone equipment, which findings were not in evidence, though they were founded upon evidence received by stipulation for purposes narrowly defined and exclusive of any others. The terms of the stipulation have already been stated in this opinion. Even if we assume in favor of the state that the evidence, when in, could be considered as indicative of the trend of market values generally, the judgment is not helped. The Commission did not take the prices paid by appellant to the affiliated corporation as the only evidence of market trends, but merely as one factor along with many others. What weighting it gave them the record does not disclose, and the Commission denied the appellant an opportunity to inquire. According to appellant's computation, telephone apparatus and equip- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 306]\n\u00a0\n ment make up less than 30% of the value of appellant's plant. Even for that portion of the plant, the Western Electric prices were not accepted as decisive, but were supplemented and corrected from sources dehors the record. For the other 70%, they were without probative significance, at all events until supplemented by evidence that the decline in the value of apparatus and equipment was less than that in the value of land or buildings or other components of the plant. To fix the value of these components the Commission had recourse to statistics which it collected for itself. There was no 'suitable opportunity through evidence and argument ... to challenge the result'. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), supra, \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, at page 70, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320.\n Second: The appellant has not estopped itself from objecting to the use of price trends gathered in its absence.\n The company did not oppose the consolidation of the state-wide investigation with the Pence law proceedings. This did not amount, however, to a waiver of its right to have the value of its property determined upon evidence. At no stage of the inquiry was there any suggestion by the Commission that a different course would be pursued. We have no need to consider how the separate proceedings would have been affected by a valuation of the property in the general investigation if the evidence of value had been gathered in the usual way. In the thought of the state such a course would have obviated the necessity for separate evidence of value as to the exchanges under bond, but the company contended otherwise and made offers of proof in support of its contention. The merits of the opposing views in that regard may be put aside as irrelevant upon the record now before us. What is certain in any event is this, that nothing in the course of the trial gave warning \n\n[301 \nU.S. 292, 307]\n\u00a0\n of the purpose of the Commission, while rejecting evidence of value in respect of exchanges under bond, to wander afield and fix the composite value of the system without reference to any evidence, upon proofs drawn from the clouds. As there was no warning of such a course, so also there was no consent to it. We do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\n Third: The allocation of excess income among the subscribers to exchanges and also among toll patrons is challenged by the appellant, the state retorting with the contention that there has been no denial of due process in the manner of partition, whatever may be said as to the possibility of inaccuracy or error.\n We find it unnecessary at this time to choose between these two contentions. A court is not required to define the proper method of allocation until there has been a proper ascertainment of the thing to be allocated. When that has been done, there may be agreement or acquiescence in respect of the manner of division. Moreover, upon another hearing the problem may be eliminated if value, revenues and expenses are proved for each exchange.\n Fourth: The same reasons that make it unnecessary to fix the method of allocation relieve us of the duty of passing upon other problems, such as those of going concern value and depreciation reserve, which cannot be disposed of adequately until the value of the physical plant has first been ascertained.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Ordered accordingly.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The stipulation states that the testimony and exhibits 'shall, however, be considered upon four issues involved in this cause and four only, viz.:\n'1.

C.I.R.(1937)\nNo. 703\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold S. Davis, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. A. F. Prescott, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under trust deed of July 19, 1922, the Old Colony Trust Company came into possession of valuable income producing property from which to pay certain sums and satisfy specified annuities. The deed continues: '13. I authorize my said trustees to pay to charities as hereinafter described such sums as in their judgment may be paid without jeopardizing the annuities herein provided for, whenever for a period of one year the trust fund held by them as then invested shall have yielded a net income equal to twice the amount of the annuities which they are then required to pay, and upon the death of the survivor of those persons, who under the terms of this instrument are to receive annual incomes under the trust hereby created, I direct my said trustees to distribute the rest and residue remaining in their hands among corporations and trustees organized, operating and holding exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes, including the encouragement of art \n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, the sum paid over by said trustees to such corporations or boards of trustees to be held by such corporations and boards of trustees in trust, and the income thereof to be expended for the general purposes for which such corporations and boards of trustees are organized, and I request that said funds be designated by each corporation or board of trustees as the Henry Clay Jackson Fund.'\n Each year after 1923 the estate's income was more than twice the amount necessary for the annuities. The trustee has kept separate principal and income accounts. From 1925 to 1933 all annuities were duly paid and considerable sums went to charities; none of these payments was charged to the principal account. Tax returns have been based upon actual receipts and disbursements.\n January 1, 1931, the income account showed unexpended balance of $187, 999.43. During that year the income received amounted to $164,339.39; the trustee expended and charged against income account $212,862.80, of which $ 190,000 went to charities. The 1931 tax return claimed deductions for charity payments up to the amount of the year's income. The Commissioner disallowed this because 'it is not disclosed that payments were made out of income of the taxable year to the charities nor that any portion of the income was credited to any charity.'\n The Board of Tax Appeals held the trustee must affirmatively prove the payments in question were from income received during 1931; also, that except as to a small sum, it had not sustained the necessary burden of proof.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (87 F.(2d) 131, 134) ruled that none of the contributions was deductible because not imperatively directed by the trust deed. It took the view that as the trustee exercised discretion as to payment they were not made 'pursuant to the terms of the ... deed creating the trust.' Accordingly, it approved the Commissioner's assessment and remanded the cause to the Board. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n The matter is here by certiorari. Annuity payments are not now in controversy. Two questions are presented and both must be answered in the negative.\n\n 1. \nUnder Section 162, Revenue Act, 1928, 45 Stat. 838, 26 U.S.C.A.  162, copied in the margin, is it necessary that the will or deed creating a trust definitely direct the charitable contributions which are claimed as deductions? 1\n Section 23(n) of the 1928 Act which authorizes certain deductions for charitable contributions by individuals does not confine them to payments actually made from income, but does limit their amount to 15 per cent. of the net received during the year. \n2\n In lieu of these deductions, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n section 162(a) permits trust estates to deduct charitable contributions to the full extent of gross income when made pursuant to the trust deed.\n We are asked to hold that the words 'pursuant to' mean directed or definitely enjoined. And this notwithstanding the admission that Congress intended to encourage charitable contributions by relieving them from taxation. Lederer, Collector, v. Stockton, \n260 \nU.S. 3\n, 43 S.Ct. 5; United States v. Provident Trust Co., Administrator, \n291 \nU.S. 272, 285\n, 54 S.Ct. 389, 392.\n'Pursuant to' is defined as 'acting or done in consequence or in prosecution (of anything); hence, agreeable; conformable; following; according.'3\n\n The words of the statute are plain and should be accorded their usual significance in the absence of some dominant reason to the contrary. We find nothing in the regulations or practice of the Treasury Department \n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n or in the general purpose of the statute which requires the narrow meaning advocated by respondent. Neither the Commissioner nor the Board of Tax Appeals accepted or mentioned with favor the interpretation which his counsel now advance; and this is hardly compatible with the theory of controlling rulings or practice by the Bureau.\n The questioned donations were made by the petitioners in pursuance of the trust deed.\n II. In order that they may be allowed as deductions is it necessary affirmatively to show that charitable contributions by a trust estate were actually paid out of income received during the year in which they were made?\n Section 23(n) limits deductible contributions to 15 per cent. of net income. Section 162(a) permits them to the full extent of gross income. This language should be construed with the view of carrying out the purpose of Congress-evidently the encouragement of donations by trust estates. There are no words limiting these to something actually paid from the year's income. And so to interpret the Act could seriously interfere with the beneficent purpose. One creating a trust might be unwilling to bind it absolutely to pay something to charity but would authorize his trustee so to do after considering then existing circumstances.\n Capital and income accounts in the conduct of the business of estates are well understood. Congress sought to encourage donations out of gross income, and we find no reason for saying that it intended to limit the exemption to sums which the trust could show were actually paid out of receipts during a particular tax year. The design was to forego some possible revenue in order to promote aid to charity. Here the trustee responded to an implied invitation and the estate ought not to be burdened in consequence. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause returned there for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act, 1928,  162, 45 Stat. 838, 26 U.S.C.A.  162.\n's 162.

HARRIMAN NAT. BANK & TRUST CO.(1937)\nNo. 588\nArgued: Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. S. Greenbaum, of New York City, for Oppenheimer.\n Mr. Martin Conboy, of New York City, for Harriman Nat. Bank & Trust co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For some years prior to the occurrences out of which this litigation arose the defendant bank was doing business in New York City. Being unable to meet current demands, it closed March 3, 1933. March 13 a conservator was appointed;1 October 16 the comptroller declared \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n it insolvent and appointed a receiver. \n2\n Later, he assessed the stockholders par value of their stock. 3 May 31, Oppenheimer brought this action in the federal court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages upon an executed rescission of a sale to him of stock of the bank by means of fraudulent representations made by its president and vice president. At the close of the evidence, the parties respectively sought a directed verdict, and, no request for submission of any issue to the jury having been made,4 the court found the bank not enriched by the sale, and the president and vice president without actual or apparent authority to make representations in connection with the sale, directed a verdict and entered judgment for the bank. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ordered that judgment for the amount demanded in the complaint be entered against the bank collectible out of assets of the receivership after payment in full of all who were creditors when the bank became insolvent. 85 F.(2d) 582.\n Plaintiff applied for a writ of certiorari contending that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that his judgment is not entitled to rank with other unsecured creditors' claims and that its ruling conflicts with decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeals. \n5\n Defendant presented its cross-petition asserting that the court erred in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n holding: That plaintiff is entitled to participate in the distribution of proceeds of assessments on stockholders collected under 12 U.S.C.  64 (12 U.S.C.A.  64); that it may be compelled to take and pay for shares of its own capital stock in a manner not authorized by 12 U.S.C.  83 (12 U.S.C.A .  83); that it is liable for fraud of its officers in connection with the sale of shares which were the property of another, the bank not being enriched by the transaction; and that plaintiff is entitled to judgment against defendant. This court granted both petitions.\n November 1, 1930, plaintiff purchased 10 shares of the bank's stock for $15,120. He was induced to buy the stock by false and fraudulent representations of the president and vice president of the bank. It sent him a bill for the purchase price. Having considerably more on deposit in the bank, plaintiff sent his check for that amount drawn on it and payable to its order. A vice president acknowledged receipt of the check and sent plaintiff a stock certificate for the shares purchased. His check marked paid and the bill receipted were returned to him. Plaintiff received dividends on the stock amounting to $525 and sold two shares for $2,408. Later, May 6, 1933, he gave the bank notice of rescission, tendered it the certificate and demanded that his account be credited with the amount of his payment less the sums he had received as dividends and from the sale of the two shares. The bank rejected his demand; he brought this suit for $ 12,187 with interest and costs. In addition to a general denial, defendant's answer set up affirmative defenses of ratification after knowledge of the fraud and of laches but at the trial these were abandoned.\n Defendant's evidence tended to prove that the stock was not owned by it but by Harriman Securities Corporation, the shares of which were held in trust for the benefit of the stock of the bank. The bank maintained in its bond department a 'suspense account' in which \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n were reflected purchases and sales of its own stock made by it for account of that corporation. The bank lent the affiliate the sums required for purchasing the stock and the amounts were charged to the latter. When the stock was sold the proceeds were credited to the affiliate. Stock so purchased was taken in the name of Kelly, an employee of the bank, as nominee of the affiliate. The shares in question were so held. Of the amount paid by plaintiff $100 was retained by the bank as its commission for making the sale; the balance was entered in the suspense account. Plaintiff had no knowledge of any transactions between the bank and its affiliate; he believed he was dealing with the bank as principal. He has paid the assessment that the comptroller made against him as stockholder and has not challenged its validity or sought repayment of any part of it.\n\n 1. \nDefendant maintains that a national bank may not incur liability to retake shares of its stock sold by it either as principal or agent.\n It cites provisions of title 12, U.S.C. (12 U.S.C.A.) governing national banking associations the substance of which follows. Section 24 ( seventh) limits the business of dealing in securities and stock to purchasing and selling without recourse. Section 56 prohibits withdrawal of capital by dividends or otherwise. Section 59 permits reduction of capital by vote of two-thirds of the stock. Section 83 declares that no such association shall make any loan or discount on the security of its own capital stock nor be a purchaser or hold its shares unless the security or purchase shall be necessary to prevent loss upon a debt previously contracted; it requires that the stock so obtained shall be sold within six months.\n Defendant suggests that, save as otherwise definitely authorized, these provisions require that the outstanding stock of a national bank shall not be reduced while its banking operations continue. On that basis it main \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n tains that to enforce rescission would in effect allow a national bank to repurchase its stock and so to accomplish by indirection what it may not do directly.\n The bank had power to sell the stock in question whether acquired by it in accordance with or contrary to section 83,6 and whether the stock belonged to it, the affiliate or a third party. \n7\n As the stock was fully paid in when originally issued, recovery by the plaintiff would not violate statutory provisions prohibiting reduction of capital. \n8\n It is to be remembered that plaintiff has fully paid his statutory liability. The bank's liability does not differ from what it would be if, instead of shares of its own stock, it had fraudulently sold to plaintiff bonds or other investment securities. \n9\n It cites section 24 (seventh) as construed in Awotin v. Atlas Exchange Nat. Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 674. But that decision does not support its contention. There the bank sold bonds and in connection with the sale agreed with the buyer that at maturity it would repurchase at par value and accrued interest. We held the agreement repugnant to section 24 (seventh) requiring sales to be without recourse. The sale was a valid executed contract; the bank's promise to repurchase was forbidden by law and therefore void. The purchaser, chargeable with knowledge of the statute, could not invoke estoppel. The statutes relied on by defendant cannot reasonably be construed to forbid rescission of fraudulent sales by national banks of their own stock. In the absence of language unquestionably disclosing that purpose, Congress may not be held to have so in- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n tended. There is no evidence of that in tention. Defrauded purchasers may rescind fraudulent sales by national banks of their own capital stock.\n\n 2. \nDefendant maintains that it may not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its officers when making the sale to plaintiff. It does not challenge the authority of its president or vice president to act for it in making sales of investment securities or stock. Through them it represented to plaintiff that the shares offered him belonged to an estate, made the sale, obtained his check for the purchase price, took the amount from his deposit, issued and sent him a stock certificate. If, as it claimed at the trial, the shares belonged to its affiliate, the latter was an undisclosed principal, and plaintiff was entitled to look to the bank as if it acting for itself. \n10\n It is immaterial whether, as between the bank and its affiliate, the amount obtained from plaintiff belonged to the former or was received by it as agent for the latter.\n\n 3. \nDefendant maintains that the proceeds of assessments may not be charged with the claim of a rescinding shareholder.\n It argues that, the bank being insolvent and in receivership, the recovery cannot be had from the assets of the bank and will of necessity come out of the money paid by shareholders. It calls attention to section 64, 12 U.S.C.A. which declares that stockholders shall be held individually responsible for all 'contracts, debts, and engagements' of the bank.\n But that contention misconstrues the judgment directed below. It is to be 'collectible out of the assets of the receivership after payment in full' of others. Manifestly the assets referred to are not limited to assessments collected from stockholders but include assets passing from the bank to the receiver. The phrase quoted from \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n section 64 relates to the liability of stockholders enforceable upon finding of insolvency, appointment of receiver and assessment by the comptroller, and not to provability or rank of claims. His determination as to the necessity and amount of assessments against shareholders is conclusive upon them and immune from collateral attack. \n11\n The bank may not in this suit invoke the rights of stockholders to defeat plaintiff's claim against it.\n Moreover, the quoted provision was enacted for the protection of the public dealing with national banks and should be reasonably construed in favor of claimants against them. To give full effect to the purpose of Congress a liberal construction is required. A technical or narrow view would be inconsistent with the true intent and meaning of the measure. There is nothing in the purpose or context of the statute to detract aught from the significance that fairly may be attributed to the words used. They are broad enough to include all pecuniary liabilities and obligations of the bank. Indeed, that is a well-recognized meaning of the word 'engagement.' Plaintiff's claim is for the money the bank fraudulently got from him and used in its business. Clearly that liability is covered by the phrase 'contracts, debts and engagements.' 12 The construction for which the defendant contends cannot be sustained.\n\n 4. \nThere remains the question whether plaintiff's judgment is entitled to share equally in the receivership estate with other unsecured creditors' claims.\n In 1930 when the bank by false representations sold him the stock and by that means obtained the price out of his deposit it immediately became bound to make res- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n titution. \n13\n The fraudulent sale was subject to rescission by the plaintiff at any time before the bank closed. Neither lapse of time while plaintiff remained ignorant of the fraud nor insolvency of the bank detracted from its liability. We assume that after March 3, 1933, the bank was without means sufficient to meet current demands and that its debts exceeded the value of its assets plus the statutory liability of its stockholders. After the appointment of a conservator, but some months before the comptroller declared the bank insolvent, plaintiff rescinded and brought this suit. He claims no lien, preference, or priority but merely seeks to share in the estate as do other unsecured creditors.\n While stockholders' liability may not be enforced before insolvency and assessment by the comptroller, we assume without deciding that plaintiff's position is the same as if the bank's insolvency had been declared and a receiver appointed before he rescinded. Plaintiff appeared by the bank's records to be a stockholder and, as against creditors for whose benefit the statutory liability was created, was estopped from denying that status. \n14\n Recognizing that the bank's fraud and his rescission availed nothing against the comptroller's assessment, plaintiff paid the amount laid against him. The judgment he seeks would establish his right to have the bank pay, because wrongfully obtained from his deposit, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n the amount for which this suit is brought. And, having fully paid his liability to the creditors, there is no reason why his claim should be subordinated to claims of stockholders on account of their deposit balances when the bank failed. The record shows that plaintiff then had a substantial amount on deposit. The bank does not claim that, in respect of deposits or other indebtedness, stockholders are not entitled to distribution on the same basis as are nonstockholding creditors. There is no foundation for any such rule. Subscription price having been fully paid to the bank, the maximum for which stockholders may be held for the benefit of creditors is the par value of their shares. By payment of the comptroller's assessments they fully discharge their liability as stockholders. And as claimants they stand on the same footing as other creditors. \n15\n Discrimination against their claims is not authorized by the statute. It follows that plaintiff's judgment is entitled to rank on a parity with other unsecured creditors' claims. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed and the case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 12 U.S.C.,  203 (12 U.S.C.A.  203). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 12 U.S.C.,  191 (12 U.S.C.A.  191). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 12 U.S.C.A.,  63, 64; see, also,  192 (12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64; see, also,  192). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Beuttell v.

Robert Eikel, Jr., and J. Newton Rayzor, both of Houston, Tex ., for petitioner.\n  Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Section 10(a) of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, as amended, title 8 \nU.S.C.  146(a), 8 \nU.S.C.A.  146(a), makes it the duty of every person including owners, masters, officers, and agents of vessels or transportation lines, 'bringing an alien to, or providing a means for an alien to come to, the United States, to prevent the landing of such alien in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the immigration officers.' Failure to comply with the provision constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. If the Secretary of Labor is of opinion that a prosecution is impracticable or inconvenient, a penalty of $1,000 is imposed and a lien upon the vessel is created for which such vessel shall be libeled in the appropriate United States court.\n  By subdivision (b) of section 10 (8 \nU.S.C.A.  146(b), proof that the alien failed to present himself at the time and place designated by the immigration officers constitutes prima facie evidence that the alien has landed at a time or place other than that designated.\n  On June 11, 1932, the Santos Maru came into the port of New Orleans with Salvatore Sprovieri, an alien passenger, on board. The passenger was en route from Brazil to Japan upon a through ticket; and was not entitled to enter the United States. On arrival of the steamship, the immigration officers at New Orleans issued a written order to the steamship to hold the alien \n\n[300 \nU.S. 98\n, 100]\n\u00a0\n on board at all ports of the United States at which the ship might touch- the order being duly served upon the officers of the ship. A few days later, the ship arrived at the port of Galveston, Texas; and there, by the negligence of the ship, its officers and crew, the alien passenger was allowed to escape and land in the United States without permission of the immigration officers and in violation of their order. Officers of the ship notified the immigration authorities of the escape of the passenger; but the ship sailed before his arrest. Subsequently, the passenger was arrested and deported on another vessel of the same line.\n  The Secretary of Labor was of opinion that it was impracticable and inconvenient to prosecute the matter criminally; and a libel was filed on behalf of the United State in the appropriate federal district court, praying a decree for the $1,000 penalty and to enforce the lien therefor against the ship.\n  The district court took the view that, the alien passenger not being bound for the United States but en route from Brazil to Japan, the ship was not liable, and dismissed the libel with prejudice. The Circuit Court of Appeals held otherwise, reversed the decree, and remanded the cause with instructions to enter a decree for the United States. The Santos Maru, 84 F.(2d) 482.\n  The basic contention of petitioner, in its assault upon the latter decree, is that one who transports an alien passenger from one foreign country to another, does not bring him to the United States, within the meaning of section 10, by entering, with the alien on board an American port of call on the way. If it were not for a sentence contained in the opinion of this court in Taylor v. United States, infra, of which we shall speak later, we might dispose of this contention by simply saying that it is contrary to the unambiguous terms of the section. Nothing can be plainer than that a ship which enters \n\n[300 \nU.S. 98\n, 101]\n\u00a0\n one of our ports has come to the United States; and a passenger on board obviously has come with the ship, and consequently has been brought by the ship to the United States. And this remains none the less the fact, although the ship continue on her way to a foreign port, and although it was intended that the passenger should go with her, and not be left in the United States. To say that the passenger has not been brought to the United States unless the intent was to leave him here, is not to construe the statute but to add an additional and qualifying term to its provisions. This we are not at liberty to do under the guise of construction, because, as this court has so often held, where the words are plain there is no room for construction. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 96; Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 421; United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396; Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55, 59\n, 60, 50.\n  It is urged that the statute is highly penal in character and should therefore be construed strictly. But the object of all construction, whether of penal or other statutes, is to ascertain the legislative intent; and in penal statutes, as in those of a different character, 'if the language be clear it is conclusive.' United States v. Hartwell, supra, 6 Wall. 385, at pages 395, 396; United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 242\n; Sacramento Nav. Co. v. Salz, \n273 \nU.S. 326, 329\n, 330, 369.\n  The duty of the ship is to prevent the landing of through alien passengers except by permission. The United States is under no obligation to permit the temporary landing of such passengers at its ports at all. A detention order is not necessary, although one was issued in this instance; for the case is not one where landing is permitted if not forbidden by the immigration officials, but where it is forbidden unless permitted. Section 10 (8 \nU.S.C.A.  146) is not like, for example, section 20 of the Immigration Act of 1924 (8 \nU.S.C.A.  167), which imposes a fine upon the owner, charterer, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 98\n, 102]\n\u00a0\n agent, consignee, or master of a vessel arriving in the United States who fails, after inspection, to detain an alien seaman employed on the vessel 'if required' by the immigration officer in charge of the port to do so. Under that provision, 'A duty so to detain does not arise unless and until such detention is required by the immigration officer.' Compagnie Generale v. Elting, \n298 \nU.S. 217, 223\n, 772. Under section 10, however, the duty is imposed by the statute and not by requirement of the immigration officials. The matter is taken care of by a regulation of the Secretary of Labor (Rule 3, subdivision H, par. 6, 'Immigration Laws and Rules of January 1, 1930,' p. 125), which provides that through alien passengers 'may land temporarily without visaed passports, for the limited period of time during which the vessel lies over in port, in cases where the examining officer is satisfied that they will depart on the vessel at the time it proceeds on the same voyage * * *.'\n  The main reliance of petitioner is on Taylor v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 120, 124\n, 125, 54. That case arose under section 18 of the Immigration Act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. 1217), which imposes the duty upon a ship bringing an alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of such alien at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers. This court held that the provision did not apply 'to the ordinary case of a sailor deserting while on shore leave.' In the course of the opinion it was said that the phrase 'bringing an alien to the United States' meant 'transporting with intent to leave in the United States and for the sake of transport-not transporting with intent to carry back, and merely as incident to employment on the instrument of transport.' 'Intent to leave' is right enough as applied to a seaman on the ship, but it may not be extended to include an alien through passenger.\n  The court there was dealing with and thinking of a sailor, and not of an alien through passenger; and its \n\n[300 \nU.S. 98\n, 103]\n\u00a0\n language must be read accordingly, for-'It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision.' Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 626\n, 627, 873. The point to be observed in the Taylor Case is that the transportation of the sailor was merely as an 'incident to employment on the instrument of transport.' That is to say, the sailor was one of the agencies which bought the ship in, rather than an alien brought in by the ship. 'It is true,' Chief Justice Marshall said in The Wilson v. United States, 30 Fed.Cas. 239, 244, No. 17,846, 1 Brock. 423, 'that a vessel coming into port, is the vehicle which brings in her crew, but we do not in common language say, that the mariners are 'imported,' or brought in by a particular vessel; we rather say they bring in the vessel.' The generality of the affirmative phrase, 'transporting with intent to leave in the United States,' is obviously qualified by the negative form of expression immediately following, 'not transporting with intent to carry back, and merely as incident to employment on the instrument of transport.' (Italics supplied.)\n  When we consider the relation of the sailor to the ship-that he is, for all practical purposes, a part of it and not, like a passenger, apart from it-it is quite apparent that the word 'alien' as used in section 10 does not, and was not intended to, include an alien sailor. Some of those engaged in the operation of a vessel must go ashore. They may be required to load and unload the cargo, to communicate with the local representatives of the line, and necessarily to perform a variety of duties which require their presence ashore. A denial of the privi- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 98\n, 104]\n\u00a0\n lege would be so likely to adversely affect commerce as to require much plainer language than we find in section 10 to justify the conclusion that Congress had denied it. To adopt that conclusion would be to declare that the act was violated whenever a member of the crew was sent ashore to perform an act imperatively necessary in the service of the ship.\n  Petitioner cites, also in support of its contention, The Alfonso XIII ( D.C.) 53 F.(2d) 124, 126; Dollar S.S. Line v. Elting (C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 1035; and The Habana (C.C.A.) 63 F.(2d) 812; but those decisions were expressly based upon what was regarded as the controlling effect of the phrase which we have quoted from the Taylor Case; and from a reading of the opinions it seems quite evident that but for that the decisions would have been otherwise. For example, Judge Woolsey, in The Alfonso XIII, said that if he were dealing with the matter de novo, uninstructed by judicial authority above him, he would have found it difficult to give the words 'bringing an alien to the United States' a meaning different from what they literally mean.\n  We reject the notion that in the case with which we are now concerned it is necessary to constitute the act of bringing an alien to the United States that there should be an intent to leave him here.\n  We see nothing in the suggestion that subdivision (b) of section 10 sustains petitioner's view of the case. That subdivision simply provides a rule of evidence affecting the burden of proof, and we think does not in any way restrict the plain meaning of section 10(a) as we have found it.\n  Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPALKO v. STATE OF CONNECTICUT(1937)\nNo. 135\nArgued: November 12, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 320]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David Goldstein and George A. Saden, both of Bridgeport, Conn ., for appellant.\n Mr. Wm. H. Comley, of Bridgeport, Conn., for the State of Connecticut.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Connecticut permitting appeals in criminal cases to be taken by the state is challenged by appellant as an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Whether the challenge should be upheld is now to be determined.\n Appellant was indicted in Fairfield County, Conn., for the crime of murder in the first degree. A jury \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n found him guilty of murder in the second degree, and he was sentenced to confinement in the state prison for life. Thereafter the State of Connecticut, with the permission of the judge presiding at the trial, gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Errors. This it did pursuant to an act adopted in 1886 which is printed in the margin. \n1\n Public Acts 1886, p. 560, now section 6494 of the General Statutes. Upon such appeal, the Supreme Court of Errors reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. State v. Palko, 121 Conn. 669, 186 A. 657. It found that there had been error of law to the prejudice of the state (1) in excluding testimony as to a confession by defendant; (2) in excluding testimony upon cross- examination of defendant to impeach his credibility; and (3) in the instructions to the jury as to the difference between first and second degree murder.\n Pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court of Errors, defendant was brought to trial again. Before a jury was impaneled, and also at later stages of the case, he made the objection that the effect of the new trial was to place him twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and in so doing to violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Upon the overruling of the objection the trial proceeded. The jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree, and the court sentenced the defendant to the punishment of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n death. The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed the judgment of conviction ( 122 Conn. 529, 191 A. 320), adhering to a decision announced in 1894 ( State v. Lee, 65 Conn. 265, 30 A. 1110, 27 L.R.A. 498, 48 Am.St.Rep. 202) which upheld the challenged statute. Cf. State v. Muolo, 118 Conn. 373, 172 A. 875. The case is here upon appeal. 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344).\n\n 1. \nThe execution of the sentence will not deprive appellant of his life without the process of law assured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n The argument for appellant is that whatever is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment is forbidden by the Fourteenth also. The Fifth Amendment, which is not directed to the States, but solely to the federal government, creates immunity from double jeopardy. No person shall be 'subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The Fourteenth Amendment ordains, 'nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' To retry a defendant, though under one indictment and only one, subjects him, it is said, to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the United States. From this the consequence is said to follow that there is a denial of life or liberty without due process of law, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the people of a state. Thirty- five years ago a like argument was made to this court in Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 23 S.Ct. 28, and was passed without consideration of its merits as unnecessary to a decision. The question is now here.\n We do not find it profitable to mark the precise limits of the prohibition of double jeopardy in federal prosecutions. The subject was much considered in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100\n, 24 S.Ct. 797, 1 Ann.Cas. 655, decided in 1904 by a closely divided court. The view was there expressed for a majority of the court that the prohibition was not confined \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n to jeopardy in a new and independent case. It forbade jeopardy in the same case if the new trial was at the instance of the government and not upon defendant's motion. Cf. Trono v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 521\n, 26 S.Ct. 121, 4 Ann.Cas. 773. All this may be assumed for the purpose of the case at hand, though the dissenting opinions (Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 134\n, 137 S., 24 S.Ct. 797, 1 Ann.Cas. 655) show how much was to be said in favor of a different ruling. Right-minded men, as we learn from those opinions, could reasonably, even if mistakenly, believe that a second trial was lawful in prosecutions subject to the Fifth Amendment, if it was all in the same case. Even more plainly, right- minded men could reasonably believe that in espousing that conclusion they were not favoring a practice repugnant to the conscience of mankind. Is double jeopardy in such circumstances, if double jeopardy it must be called, a denial of due process forbidden to the States? The tyranny of labels (Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 114\n, 54 S.Ct. 330, 335, 90 A.L.R. 575) must not lead us to leap to a conclusion that a word which in one set of facts may stand for oppression or enormity is of like effect in every other.\n We have said that in appellant's view the Fourteenth Amendment is to be taken as embodying the prohibitions of the Fifth. His thesis is even broader. Whatever would be a violation of the original bill of rights ( Amendments 1 to 8) if done by the federal government is now equally unlawful by force of the Fourteenth Amendment if done by a state. There is no such general rule.\n The Fifth Amendment provides, among other things, that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury. This court has held that, in prosecutions by a state, presentment or indictment by a grand jury may give way to informations at the instance of a public officer. Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 292; Gaines v. Washington, \n277 \nU.S. 81, 86\n, 48 S.Ct. 468, 470. The Fifth Amendment provides also that no person shall be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. This court has said that, in prosecutions by a state, the exemption will fail if the state elects to end it. Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 106\n, 111 S., 112, 29 S.Ct. 14. Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra, \n291 \nU.S. 97\n, at page 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 90 A.L.R. 575; Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278, 285\n, 56 S.Ct. 461, 464. The Sixth Amendment calls for a jury trial in criminal cases and the Seventh for a jury trial in civil cases at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed $20. This court has ruled that consistently with those amendments trial by jury may be modified by a state or abolished altogether. Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 \nU.S. 90\n; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494; New York Central R.R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 208\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A.1917D, 1, Ann. Cas.1917D, 629; Wagner Electric Co. v. Lyndon, \n262 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 43 S.Ct. 589, 591. As to the Fourth Amendment, one should refer to Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 398\n, 34 S.Ct. 341, L.R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann.Cas. 1915C, 1177, and as to other provisions of the Sixth, to West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258\n, 24 S.Ct. 650.\n On the other hand, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may make it unlawful for a state to abridge by its statutes the freedom of speech which the First Amendment safeguards against encroachment by the Congress (De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 364\n, 57 S.Ct. 255, 260; Herndon v. Lowry, \n301 \nU.S. 242, 259\n, 57 S.Ct. 732, 740) or the like freedom of the press (Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 56 S.Ct. 444; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 627), or the free exercise of religion ( Hamilton v. Regents of University, \n293 \nU.S. 245, 262\n, 55 S.Ct. 197, 204; cf. Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468), or the right of peaceable assembly, without which speech would be unduly trammeled (De Jonge v. Oregon, supra; Herndon v. Lowry, supra), or the right of one accused of crime to the benefit of counsel (Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 87 A.L.R. 527). In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against the federal government by force of the specific \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n pledges of particular amendments2 have been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid as against the states.\n The line of division may seem to be wavering and broken if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one side and the other. Reflection and analysis will induce a different view. There emerges the perception of a rationalizing principle which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence. The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a 'principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra, \n291 \nU.S. 97\n, at page 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 90 A.L.R. 575; Brown v. Mississippi, supra, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n, at page 285, 56 S.Ct. 461, 464; Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102. Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them. What is true of jury trials and indictments is true also, as the cases show, of the immunity from compulsory self-incrimination. Twining v. New Jersey, supra. This too might be lost, and justice still be done. Indeed, today as in the past there are students of our penal system who look upon the immunity as a mischief rather than a benefit, and who \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n would limit its scope, or destroy it altogether. \n3\n No doubt there would remain the need to give protection against torture, physical or mental. Brown v. Mississippi, supra. Justice, however, would not perish if the accused were subject to a duty to respond to orderly inquiry. The exclusion of these immunities and privileges from the privileges and immunities protected against the action of the States has not been arbitrary or casual. It has been dictated by a study and appreciation of the meaning, the essential implications, of liberty itself.\n We reach a different plane of social and moral values when we pass to the privileges and immunities that have been taken over from the earlier articles of the Federal Bill of Rights and brought within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of absorption. These in their origin were effective against the federal government alone. If the Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed them, the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed. Twining v. New Jersey, supra, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, at page 99, 29 S.Ct. 14, 19.4 This is true, for illustration, of freedom of thought and speech. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n Of that freedom one may say that it is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. With rare aberrations a pervasive recognition of that truth can be traced in our history, political and legal. So it has come about that the domain of liberty, withdrawn by the Fourteenth Amendment from encroachment by the states, has been enlarged by latter-day judgments to include liberty of the mind as well as liberty of action. \n5\n The extension became, indeed, a logical imperative when once it was recognized, as long ago it was, that liberty is something more than exemption from physical restraint, and that even in the field of substantive rights and duties the legislative judgment, if oppressive and arbitrary, may be overridden by the courts. Cf. Near v. Minnesota, supra; De Jonge v. Oregon, supra. Fundamental too in the concept of due process, and so in that of liberty, is the thought that condemnation shall be rendered only after trial. Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34\n, 14 S.Ct. 1108; Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421\n, 52 S.Ct. 252. The hearing, moreover, must be a real one, not a sham or a pretense. Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 265; Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406. For that reason, ignorant defendants in a capital case were held to have been condemned unlawfully when in truth, though not in form, they were refused the aid of counsel. Powell v. Alabama, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, at pages 67, 68, 53 S.Ct. 55, 63, 84 A.L.R. 527. The decision did not turn upon the fact that the benefit of counsel would have been guaranteed to the defendants by the provisions of the Sixth Amendment if they had been prosecuted in a federal court. The decision turned upon the fact that in the particular situation laid before us in the evidence the benefit of counsel was essential to the substance of a hearing. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 328]\n\u00a0\n Our survey of the cases serves, we think, to justify the statement that the dividing line between them, if not unfaltering throughout its course, has been true for the most part to a unifying principle. On which side of the line the case made out by the appellant has appropriate location must be the next inquiry and the final one. Is that kind of double jeopardy to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so acute and shocking that our policy will not endure it? Does it violate those 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions'? Hebert v. Louisiana, supra. The answer surely must be 'no.' What the answer would have to be if the state were permitted after a trial free from error to try the accused over again or to bring another case against him, we have no occasion to consider. We deal with the statute before us and no other. The state is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials. It asks no more than this, that the case against him shall go on until there shall be a trial free from the corrosion of substantial legal error. State v. Felch, 92 Vt. 477, 105 A. 23; State v. Lee, supra. This is not cruelty at all, nor even vexation in any immoderate degree. If the trial had been infected with error adverse to the accused, there might have been review at his instance, and as often as necessary to purge the vicious taint. A reciprocal privilege, subject at all times to the discretion of the presiding judge (State v. Carabetta, 106 Conn. 114, 137 A. 394), has now been granted to the state. There is here no seismic innovation. The edifice of justice stands, its symmetry, to many, greater than before.\n\n 2. \nThe conviction of appellant is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen of the United States. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 319, 329]\n\u00a0\n There is argument in his behalf that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the due process clause has been flouted by the judgment.\n Maxwell v. Dow, supra, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, at page 584, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494, gives all the answer that is necessary.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6494.

Gen., for Helvering.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a purported sale by a corporation to its stockholders, of shares of stock issued by and acquired from another corporation, the sale being effected by means of an issue to the stockholders of rights to purchase the stock at a named price, is to be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n treated as a distribution of corporate earnings taxable as a dividend to the stockholders when received, within the reach of sections 22 and 115 of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791 (26 U.S.C.A.  22, 115 and notes).\n In January, 1929, the American Superpower Company, of which petitioner was a stockholder, acquired through consolidation of public utility corporations, in one of which it in turn was a stockholder, a large amount of the securities of the United Corporation, the latter being received in exchange for stock of the consolidated corporations owned by Superpower. The securities received included shares of the preference stock of United, 2,210,583 shares of its common stock, and 1,000,000 rights to subscribe for United common stock at any time for $27.50 a share. United was incorporated January 7, 1929. The consolidation was effected January 12th, when Superpower became entitled to its allotment of the securities. On January 23, 1929, the board of directors of Superpower, pursuant to a plan to strengthen its cash position and to create a wide market for the stock of United, adopted a resolution offering to its common stockholders of record January 26, 1929, the privilege of purchasing, at $25 a share, one-half share of United for each share of their common stock in Superpower. The privilege was evidenced by negotiable certificates distributed to stockholders about January 31. By their terms they were to become void unless the privilege was exercised by February 15, 1929. On that date petitioner exercised the privilege by purchasing his allotment of 3,198 shares of United at $25 a share. In its books, records and accounts, Superpower treated the transaction as a sale of the United stock, resulting in no change in its net assets or earnings.\n The prices received by Superpower for shares distributed to its stockholders represented a substantial profit \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 66]\n\u00a0\n to it over cost of the securities which it had exchanged for them. It reported the profit in its 1929 income tax return and paid the tax on it for that year. In computing the tax the commissioner in allocating the cost of the three classes of securities received from United by Superpower, found it necessary to determine the value of each class of security when received. He did this by finding the total value of the securities and allocating to the common stock a value of $25 a share. On or about January 9th, bankers who were active in promoting the consolidation purchased from United 400,000 shares of its stock at $22.50 per share. Shortly after the adoption by Superpower, on January 23rd, of the plan for distribution of the United stock, an active market developed on the New York Curb Exchange for the sale of subscription rights. On January 25th, 11,000 rights were sold at prices ranging from 11 5\/8 to 12 3\/8 making the cost per share to purchasers of the rights, upon their exercise, about $50. On January 28th, 44,000 of them were dealt in on the exchange at prices ranging from 12 5\/8 to 17 1\/2, with a corresponding cost of the shares of from $50 to $60. On January 29th, 30th and 31st, Superpower sold about 9,200 shares of its United Stock on the open market at from $50 to $63 per share.\n On May 1, 1929, a like privilege to purchase one-fourth of a share of stock of United At $30 a share for each share of Superpower was extended to the stockholders of the latter, as of May 8, 1929, which petitioner similarly exercised on May 24, 1929. On June 5, 1929, a like privilege was given to the common stockholders of Superpower as of June 18, 1929, to purchase stock of Commonwealth and Southern Corporation at $15 a share, which petitioner exercised on July 2, 1929\n\n\n Petitioner did not, in 1929, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares for which he subscribed or report their receipt in his income tax returns for that year. The Com- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n missioner ruled that the rights to subscribe were dividends and assessed a deficiency against petitioner based on their market value on the respective dates when the stockholders were first entitled to exercise them. The cause was heard by the Board of Tax Appeals upon a stipulation of facts which it adopted as a finding and which specified the facts already detailed. The Board held that the distributions were sales of the shares by Superpower to its stockholders, not dividends, and reduced the deficiency accordingly. In reaching this decision the Board, upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances attending the issue of the rights by Superpower to its stockholders, found that there was no intention to distribute any of its earnings to stockholders and that the transaction was what it purported to be on its face-a sale to stockholders of part of the corporate assets. As a supporting fact it found that the fair value of the common stock of United during January, 1929, was $25 a share. It concluded that the facts as stipulated and as found by it did not show fair market value of the United Stock in May, 1929, or of the Commonwealth and Southern stock in June or July of that year. Upon the entire record it was of the opinion that there was no reason to treat the transaction any differently than the parties had treated it, as a sale of a part of the assets of Superpower from which no taxable gain would result before the taxpayer sold or otherwise disposed of the shares.\n The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the distributions were taxable dividends measured by the difference between the value of the several allotments of shares on the respective dates when the rights were exercised and the prices paid for them. 88 F.(2d) 559. In reaching this conclusion the court recognized that the Board had found the January, 1929, value of the stock of United to be $25 a share. But it thought that the Board in making the finding had disre garded \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n the substantial prices at which the rights were sold pending their exercise, denying to them persuasive weight because it had mistakenly assumed that the purported sale could not be treated as a dividend unless there was intention to distribute the corporate earnings. The court held that what was done, and not what was intended, was the decisive factor, and as there was substantial evidence that the stock, when distributed, was worth more than the price received, there was a distribution of corporate assets from earnings, taxable to stockholders as a dividend. It accordingly remanded the cause to enable the board to ascertain the value of the distributed shares on the dates when the rights were exercised ( February 15, 1929, May 24, 1929, July 2, 1929).\n Both the taxpayer and the Commissioner petitioned for certiorari, the one challenging the ruling that the distributions were dividends, and the other assigning as error the failure to hold that the critical dates for fixing the value of the dividends for taxation were either those when the rights were received by the stockholders or when the stockholders first became entitled to exercise them, rather than the times when they were actually exercised. We granted certiorari, \n301 \nU.S. 676\n, 57 S.Ct. 922, because of the importance of the questions in the administration of the revenue laws, and the doubts which have been raised as to their appropriate answers by the varying opinions of the circuit courts of appeals. Compare the opinions below, Ramapo, Inc., v. Commissioner (C.C.A.2d) 84 F.(2d) 986, and Commissioner v. Mayer (C.C.A. 7th) 86 F.(2d) 593, with Helvering v. Bartlett (C.C.A.4th) 71 F.(2d) 598, and Commissioner v. Cummings (C.C.A.5th) 77 F.(2d) 670.\n By sections 111, 112 and 113 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A .  111, 112 and notes, 113 note), profits derived from the purchase of property, as distinguished from exchanges of property, are ascertained and taxed as of the date of its sale or other disposition \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n by the purchaser. Profit, if any, accrues to him only upon sale or disposition, and the taxable income is the difference between the amount thus realized and its cost, less allowed deductions. It follows that one does not subject himself to income tax by the mere purchase of property, even if at less than its true value, and that taxable gain does not accrue to him before he sells or otherwise disposes of it. Specific provisions establishing this basis for the taxation of gains derived from purchased property were included in the 1916 and each subsequent revenue act and accompanying regulations.\n Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  22 and note) includes 'dividends' in 'gross income,' which is the basis of determining taxable net income, and section 115 (26 U.S.C.A.  115 and note) defines 'dividend' as 'any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property, out of its earnings or profits.' While a sale of corporate assets to stockholders is, in a literal sense, a distribution of its property, such a transaction does not necessarily fall within the statutory definition of a dividend. For a sale to stockholders may not result in any diminution of its net worth and in that case cannot result in any distribution of its profits.\n On the other hand, such a sale, if for substantially less than the value of the property sold, may be as effective a means of distributing profits among stockholders as the formal declaration of a dividend. The necessary consequence of the corporate action may be in substance the kind of a distribution to stockholders which it is the purpose of section 115 to tax as present income to stockholders, and such a transaction may appropriately be deemed in effect the declaration of a dividend, taxable to the extent that the value of the distributed property exceeds the stipulated price. But the bare fact that a transaction, on its face a sale, has resulted in a distribution of some of the corporate assets to stockholders, gives rise to no inference \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n that the distribution is a dividend within the meaning of section 115. To transfer it from the one category to the other, it is at least necessary to make some showing that the transaction is in purpose or effect used as an implement for the distribution of corporate earnings to stockholders.\n The facts stipulated and the finding of the fair market value of the United stock at the time of the adoption of the first plan for its distribution abundantly sustain the Board's conclusion that the transaction-in form a sale-was not intended to be the means of a distribution of earnings to stockholders. There may be cases in which market quotations, after the subscription rights have been issued, are persuasive evidence of value as of the time when the plan was adopted, and hence of its purpose and probable effect. But we cannot say that the Board here, in finding the value of the shares of the newly organized United as of the time of adoption of the first plan, did not consider the market prices of the rights. The findings are inferences which the Board was free to draw from all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record. Such a determination of fact is not to be set aside by a court even if upon examination of the evidence it might draw a different inference. Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 132 S., 55 S.Ct. 732, 736; Elmhurst Cemetery Co. v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 37\n, 57 S.Ct. 324. We accept the findings as at least establishing that the plan was adopted by Superpower in good faith as a means of effecting a sale of its assets to stockholders at fair market value. Hence the issue for decision, in so far as the first allotment of stock is concerned, is narrowed to the question of law whether the commitment of Superpower, by formal action of its Board, to the sale of United stock at its then fair market value and the ensuing distribution to stockholders is taken out of the category of sales and placed in that of dividends by the fact that, pending execution of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n project, rights to subscribe sold on the exchange at substantial prices, or that the stock itself sold at prices substantially above the stipulated purchase price.\n First. The mere issue of rights to subscribe and their receipt by stockholders is not a dividend. No distribution of corporate assets or diminution of the net worth of the corporation results in any practical sense. Even though the rights have a market or exchange value, they are not dividends within the statutory definition. Cf. Miles v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co., \n259 \nU.S. 247\n, 42 S.Ct. 483; Helvering v. San Joaquin Co., \n297 \nU.S. 496\n, 56 S.Ct. 569; Helvering v. Bartlett, supra. They are at most options or continuing offers, potential sources of income to the stockholders through sale or the exercise of the rights. Taxable income might result from their sale, but distribution of the corporate property could take place only on their exercise. The question, then, is whether the distribution which results from the exercise of the rights must be regarded as a dividend if the reasonable value of the property at the time of exercise is more than the purchase price.\n Second. We think that a distribution of assets by a corporation to its stockholders by means of a sale, to which it is committed by appropriate corporate action at a time when their sale price represents their reasonable value, is not converted into a dividend by the mere circumstance that later, at the time of their delivery to stockholders, they have a higher value. The meaning of section 115 must be sought in the light of the situations to which it must be applied. It does not purport to withdraw corporations and their stockholders wholly from the operation of sections 111, 112, and 113, taxing the profits of purchasers. It cannot be taken to withhold from corporations the power at their own election to effect, by workable means, sales of their assets to stockholders at fair value, subject to that incidence of taxing statutes which usually attends sales. The distribution contem plated \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n and defined by it as a dividend is one to be effected by corporate action. Hence, in determining whether a given transaction is 'sale' or 'dividend,' the corporate action which results in one or the other must be scrutinized in the light of the circumstances at the time when the action is taken, and of the conditions under which in practice it must be taken.\n The only feasible method by which a corporation of large membership can effect a sale of its assets to stockholders is by tendering to them rights to subscribe, a method whose indispensable first step is the adoption, by appropriate corporate action, of the terms of the offer. Between the dates of the first step and of subscription a substantial period of time must elapse, during which the rights may, and often do, become the subject of violent market fluctuations. Any vendor who offers property for sale at a named price similarly carries the burden or risk that the property may increase in value between offer and acceptance. If the sale is by executory contract he also carries the risk between promise and performance. It is an inseparable incident of every sale except those in which conditions admit of payment for the property simultaneously with its tender for sale, a procedure which may not be available to a corporation seeking to sell its property to stockholders.\n It is a solecism to speak of a corporation as distributing its profits for the sole reason that, after it has unavoidably assumed that risk in order to effect a sale of its property to stockholders at a fair price, the property increases in value. Price, which in the present case is decisive of the issue, must be determined in the light of the situation existing when price is fixed. If the option price is fair when fixed, the transaction is a tender for a sale and not for a distribution of profits-a dividend as defined by section 115. If, pending execution of the plan, there were no change in value of the stock, the transac- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n tion would throughout concededly retain its character as a sale. Its character is not altered by the fluctuations of a speculative market, after the corporate action which defines the character of the transaction has been taken.\n When the corporation has committed itself to a sale of its assets to stockholders at present market value, the effect on its balance sheet is the same as in the case of other vendors who in various ways assume the risk of rising prices pending the consummation of the sale. In every case purchases may, as a result of market change, acquire property at less than its value at the date of acquisition. But in the case of the corporation it does not follow that there has been a distribution of its profits. It can hardly be said that profits accrue to a corporation from a fortuitous gain in market value, the benefits of which it has relinquished before the gain occurs. Distribution of profits is neither the purpose nor effect of the action taken by the corporation, and there is no adequate basis for saying that the transaction to which the directors committed their corporation was the distribution of earnings, and hence a dividend rather than a fairly conducted sale of corporate property with all the incidents which usually attend a sale when the price is fixed in advance of performance. It is decisive of the present case, so far as the first allotment of United shares is concerned, that distribution of corporate assets, effected by the sale, was not intended to be a means of distributing earnings, and that the price when fixed represented the fair market value of the property to be distributed.\n There has been no finding, either by the Commissioner or the Board, of the fair market value of the United stock in May or of the Commonwealth & Southern in June, the months when the plans for the second and third allotments of the shares were adopted. The finding of the Board that the facts as stipulated were not \n\n[302 \nU.S. 63, 74]\n\u00a0\n sufficient to establish fair market value of the shares on those dates furnish sufficient support for its conclusion that there was no basis for treating the transactions, which were on their face sales, as distributions of earnings and hence dividends as defined by section 115.\n The writ in No. 59 is dismissed and in No. 19 the judgment is reversed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO v. SHELL CO.(1937)\nNo. 18\nArgued: November 9, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for People of puerto rico.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. D. Whitney, of New York City, James R. Beverley, of San Juan, P.R., and Gabriel I. Lewis, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a criminal proceeding brought by petitioner against the respondents in the insular district court of San Juan, Puerto Rico. An information filed by the district attorney charged respondents with entering into a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the local anti-trust act, passed by the Legislature of Puerto Rico March 14, 1907. Demurrers to the information were sustained by the district court on the ground that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 (15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note), supplemented by the Clayton Act of 1914 (15 U.S.C.A.  12-27), covered the entire field embraced by the local anti-trust act, and the latter, therefore, was void. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico accepted that view and dismissed the appeal; and its judgment was affirmed on appeal by the court below. (C.C.A.) 86 F.2d 577. The single question which we have to decide is whether the existence of section 3 of the Sherman Act ( 15 U.S.C.A.  3) precluded the adoption of the local act by the insular legislature.\n The pertinent provisions of the Sherman Act and the local act are set forth in the margin. \n1\n Section 3 of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Act and section 1 of the local act, so far as the question here involved is concerned, are substantially identical. Section 4 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.A.  4) confers jurisdiction \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n in respect of violations of the act upon the several district courts of the United States. Section 3 of the local act confers jurisdiction upon the district courts of Puerto Rico in respect of violations of that act.\n First. Section 3 of the Sherman Act extends to 'any territory of the United States.' But it is urged that Puerto Rico cannot be brought within the intent of this phrase, and, therefore, the section does not apply to that dependency. The point is not well made. When the Sherman Act was passed (1890), we had no insular dependencies; and, necessarily, the application of section 3 did not extend beyond our continental domain; and, undoubtedly, it was this domain which was in the immediate contemplation of Congress. Certainly, Congress at that time did not have Puerto Rico in mind. But that is not enough. It is necessary to go further and to say that, if the acquisition of that insular dependency had been foreseen, Congress would have so varied its comprehensive language as to exclude it from the operation of the act. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 644; Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 195\n, 196 S., 43 S.Ct. 65, 68; United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, \n261 \nU.S. 204, 207\n, 208 S., 43 S.Ct. 338, 339. The only question, therefore, is whether the word 'territory,' as used in section 3 of the Sherman Act, properly can be applied to a dependency now bearing the relation to the United States which is borne by Puerto Rico.\n In Balzac v. Puerto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298, 304\n, 305 S., 42 S.Ct. 343, 345, it was held that, although the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution with respect to the right of trial by jury applied to the territories of the United States, it did not apply to territory belonging to the United States which had not been incorporated into the Union; and that neither the Philippines nor Porto Rico was territory which had been so incorporated or had become a part of the United States, as distinguished from merely belonging to it. But it is evident, from a consideration of the pertinent acts \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n of Congress and the decisions of this court with respect to these acts, that whether Puerto Rico comes within a given congressional act applicable in terms to a 'territory' depends upon the character and aim of the act. Words generally have different shades of meaning, and are to be construed if reasonably possible to effectuate the intent of the lawmakers; and this meaning in particular instances is to be arrived at not only by a consideration of the words themselves, but by considering, as well, the context, the purposes of the law, and the circumstances under which the words were employed. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 433\n, 52 S.Ct. 607, 608; Helvering v. Stockholms &c. Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 86\n, 87 S., 88, 55 S.Ct. 50, 51, 52. Thus, although Puerto Rico is not a territory within the reach of the Sixth and Seventh Amendments and may not be a 'territory' within the meaning of the word as used in some statutes, we held in Kopel v. Bingham, \n211 \nU.S. 468, 474\n, 475 S., 476, 29 S.Ct. 190, 192, that Puerto Rico was a 'territory' within the meaning of section 5278 of the Revised Statutes (18 U.S.C.A.  662), which provides for the demand and surrender of fugitive criminals by governors of territories as well as of states. The court said that it was impossible to hold that Puerto Rico was not intended to have power to reclaim fugitives from its justice, or that it was intended that it should be an asylum for fugitives from the United States. The word 'territory' as used in that statute was defined as meaning 'a portion of the country not included within the limits of any state, and not yet admitted as a state into the Union, but organized under the laws of Congress with a separate legislature, under a territorial governor and other officers appointed by the President and Senate of the United States.' And the court concluded: 'It may be justly asserted that Porto Rico is a completely organized territory, although not a territory incorporated into the United States, and that there is no reason why Porto Rico should not be held to be such a territory \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n as is comprised in  5278.' See People of Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, \n227 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 33 S.Ct. 352. Compare Talbott v. Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 445 S., 11 S.Ct. 594.\n With equal force, it may be said here that there is no reason why Puerto Rico should not be held to be a 'territory' within the meaning of section 3 of the Sherman Act. We pointed out in the Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers Case, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 427\n, at page 435, 52 S.Ct. 607, 609, that in the light of the applicable history and circumstances it was apparent that Congress meant to deal comprehensively with the subject of contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, 'and to that end to exercise all the power it possessed'; that, while Congress in passing section 1 (15 U.S.C.A.  1) exercised only the power conferred by the commerce clause, in passing section 3 (15 U.S.C.A.  3) it exercised a general power, unlimited by that clause. We therefore concluded that the word 'trade' as used in section 3 should be given a more extended meaning than the same word as used in section 1.\n If, as we there determined, Congress intended by the Sherman Act to exert all the power it possessed in respect of the subject matter-trade and commerce-it is equally reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to include all territories to which its powers might extend. The same reason which requires the utmost liberality of construction in respect of the word 'trade' also requires the same degree of liberality of construction in respect of the word 'territory'; and we hold, accordingly, that the word 'territory' was used in its most comprehensive sense, as embracing all organized territories, whether incorporated into the United States or not, including Puerto Rico.\n Second. The court below held that, although section 1 of the local act contained some words not to be found in section 3 of the Sherman Act, the pertinent provisions were in substance the same; that the act charged in the information as a crime under the local statute was the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n same as that denounced as a crime in the Sherman Act; and that in each instance the offense was a crime against the sovereignty of the United States. With that view we agree. But that court concluded that the act of Congress pre-empted the ground occupied by the local act and superseded it; and consequently the local district court was without jurisdiction of the offense. With that conclusion we are unable to agree.\n\n 1. \nSection 14 of the Foraker Act, passed April 12, 1900, c. 191, 31 Stat. 77, 80 (48 U.S.C.A.  734 and note), provided that the statutory laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, should have the same force and effect in Puerto Rico as in the United States, with certain exceptions not material here. Section 27 (page 82) provided: 'That all local legislative powers hereby granted shall be vested in a legislative assembly.' And by section 32 (pages 83, 84) it was provided that the legislative authority 'shall extend to all matters of a legislative character not locally inapplicable.' These various provisions are continued in force by sections 9, 25 and 37 of the Organic Act of March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951 (48 U.S.C.A.  734, 811, 774, 821). These provisions do not differ in substance from the various provisions relating to the powers of the organized and incorporated continental territories of the United States, in respect of which this court said in Clinton v. Englebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 441, that the theory upon which these territories have been organized 'has ever been that of leaving to the inhabitants all the powers of self-government consistent with the supremacy and supervision of National authority, and with certain fundamental principles established by Congress'; and in Hornbuckle v. Toombs, 18 Wall. 648, 655, 656, we said: 'The powers thus exercised by the Territorial legislatures are nearly as extensive as those exercised by any State legislature.' See, also, Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 684\n, 11 S.Ct. 222, where this court, speaking of this typical general provi- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n sion contained in the Utah Organic Act, said that, with the exceptions noted in the provision itself,' the power of the territorial legislature was apparently as plenary as that of the legislature of a state.' In Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190, 204\n, 8 S.Ct. 723, 726, the essential similarity of the various provisions in respect of the powers of territorial legislatures was pointed out, and it was said that what were 'rightful subjects of legislation' was to be determined 'by an examination of the subjects upon which legislatures had been in the practice of acting with the consent and approval of the people they represented.'\n The grant of legislative power in respect of local matters, contained in section 32 of the Foraker Act and continued in force by section 37 of the Organic Act of 1917 (48 U.S.C.A.  774, 821), is as broad and comprehensive as language could make it. The primary question posed by the challenge to the validity of the act under consideration is whether the matter covered by the act is one 'of a legislative character not locally inapplicable.' It requires no argument to demonstrate that a conspiracy in restraint of trade within the borders of Puerto Rico is clearly a local matter, and that it falls within the precise terms of the power granted by sections 32 and 37 of the respective acts in which the grant is found. The power being given without express limitation, a conclusion that the present exercise of the power is precluded by the existence of section 3 of the Sherman Act must rest upon the assumption that a congressional statute penalizing specific local behavior and a statute of Puerto Rico to the same effect cannot coexist. With due regard to the status of the territory, the character of its established government, the positive terms of the congressional grant of power, and the lack of conflict between the two acts, that assumption must be rejected.\n\n 2. \nThe aim of the Foraker Act and the Organic Act was to give Puerto Rico full power of local self-determination \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n with an autonomy similar to that of the states and incorporated territories. Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362, 370\n, 32 S.Ct. 499; People of Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, supra, \n227 \nU.S. 270\n, at page 274, 33 S.Ct. 352. The effect was to confer upon the territory many of the attributes of quasi sovereignty possessed by the states-as, for example, immunity from suit without their consent. People of Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, supra. By those acts, the typical American governmental structure, consisting of the three independent departments-legislative, executive and judicial-was erected. 'A body politic'-a commonwealth-was created. 31 Stat. 79,  7, c. 191 (48 U.S.C.A.  733). The power of taxation, the power to enact and enforce laws, and other characteristically governmental powers were vested. And, so far as local matters are concerned, as we have already shown in respect of the continental territories, legislative powers were conferred nearly, if not quite, as extensive as those exercised by the state legislatures.\n This comprehensive grant of legislative power made by Congress plainly recognizes the great desirability of devolving upon the local government the responsibility of searching out local offenses and prosecuting them in the local tribunals. The insular Supreme Court in this case declared in emphatic terms the wisdom of such local control in respect of the matter dealt with by the act in question. Although striking down, with evident reluctance, the act as invalid, that court said: 'The right of the Insular Legislature and officers to prosecute and punish such monopolies as may be set up within our jurisdiction is really inestimable. It was so understood by our Legislature when it took upon itself to legislate on the subject. This is a wholesome and necessary legislation that should be enforced through the insular courts. It must be admitted that The People of Puerto Rico has a special interest in prosecuting before the courts those citizens who violate its own laws. No matter how interested \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n the National Government may be in prosecuting such offenses, instances might occur where the latter would pass unnoticed by the federal officers, or where, for some reason or other, such officers might not display the same activity and interest that is to be expected from the local officials.'\n\n 3. \nIn the light of the foregoing considerations, including the sweeping character of the congressional grant of power contained in the Foraker Act and the Organic Act of 1917, the general purpose of Congress to confer power upon the government of Puerto Rico to legislate in respect of all local matters is made manifest. In this connection it is significant that the only express limitation upon the power is that, in certain of its aspects, it shall be exercised consistently with the provisions of the respective acts. See sections 37, 57 of the Organic Act ( 48 U.S.C.A.  735, 736, 774, 821), and section 32 of the Foraker Act (31 Stat. 83). Nothing is expressed in these acts or, so far as we are advised, in any other federal act which suggests a congressional intent to limit the exercise of the power of local legislation to those subjects in respect of which there is an absence of explicit legislation by Congress; and we find nothing in the nature of the power or in the consequences likely to ensue from the duplicate exercise of it which requires an implication to that effect.\n Our attention is called to certain differences of language in the two acts; and it is urged that these differences create a 'risk' of conflict of interpretation between the local courts and the federal district courts. The fear of conflicting decisions is more fanciful than real, since we agree with the court below that there is in fact no substantial conflict between the pertinent provisions of the two statutes. But in the unlikely event that, in spite of this conclusion, a conflict of decisions shall arise, the power of the federal appellate courts to resolve that conflict is clear. Sections 128(a) and 240, Judicial Code, as \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 264]\n\u00a0\n amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 936, 938, 28 U.S.C.  225(a), 347, 28 U.S.C.A.  225(a), 347.\n It likewise is clear that the legislative duplication gives rise to no danger of a second prosecution and conviction, or of double punishment for the same offense. The risk of double jeopardy2 does not exist. Both the territorial and federal laws and the courts, whether exercising federal or local jurisdiction, are creations emanating from the same sovereignty. See Balzac v. Puerto Rico, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 298\n, at page 312, 42 S.Ct. 343, 348. Prosecution under one of the laws in the appropriate court, necessarily, will bar a prosecution under the other law in another court. Grafton v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 333\n, 27 S.Ct. 749, 11 Ann.Cas. 640. In that case, Grafton, a soldier in the Army, had been acquitted by a general court martial convened in the Philippine Islands of a crime not capital, alleged to have been committed in violation of the Sixty-Second Article of War. Subsequently, a criminal information in the name of the United States was filed in a Philippine court of first instance, charging him with the same offense committed in violation of a local law. This court held that the acquittal of the accused by the court martial precluded his being again tried for the same offense in the civil courts, for the reason that he would thus be put twice in jeopardy of punishment. The Sixty-Second Article of War3 was a federal statute. Revised Statutes,  1342. The general court martial was a federal tribunal. The Philippine act was a local law; and the court of first instance was a local court. But both of the laws and both \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 265]\n\u00a0\n of the courts owed their existence to the same supreme authority. The situation presented there was, in all essentials, the same as that presented here. The decision of the court in that case rested upon the ground that the accused, having been acquitted by the federal tribunal, could not be subjected to prosecution in another court, civil or military, of the same sovereignty. We held that, although the same act might constitute distinct offenses against a state and against the United States, for both of which the accused might be prosecuted, that rule had no application to acts committed in the Philippine Islands. We said (\n206 \nU.S. 333\n, at pages 354, 355, 27 S.Ct. 749, 755, 11 Ann.Cas. 640): 'The government of a state does not derive its powers from the United States, while the government of the Philippines owes its existence wholly to the United States, and its judicial tribunals exert all their powers by authority of the United States. The jurisdiction and authority of the United States over that territory and its inhabitants, for all legitimate purposes of government, is paramount. So that the cases holding that the same acts committed in a state of the Union may constitute an offense against the United States and also a distinct offense against the state, do not apply here, where the two tribunals that tried the accused exert all their powers under and by authority of the same government,-that of the United States.'\n An attempt is made to distinguish the Grafton Case on the ground that but one statute was there involved-namely, the statute of the Philippine Islands-and that both the general court martial and the Philippine court undertook to enforce that statute. Obviously, that view is incorrect. The court-martial proceeding was not to enforce the Philippine legislation, but to enforce the Sixty-Second Article of War; and that article was none the less a federal law, distinct from the local law, because it might be necessary to refer to the local law to determine whether \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 266]\n\u00a0\n the act charged against the soldier was embraced by the term 'crimes' in the Sixty-Second Article. This is well illustrated by section 289 of the Criminal Code, as amended (18 U.S.C.  468, 18 U.S.C.A.  468), which, in respect of offenses committed upon places subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States within the limits of a state or organized territory or district, makes applicable the laws of such state, territory, or district in respect of such offenses. Prosecutions under that section, however, are not to enforce the laws of the state, territory, or district, but to enforce the federal law, the details of which, instead of being recited, are adopted by reference. See United States v. Press Publishing Co., \n219 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 212, 21 Ann.Cas. 942.\n\n 4. \nThe decisions of the supreme courts of four states, rendered when the states were newly created from former territories, are, except in one particular, of which we shall speak later, in harmony with the views we have expressed. Those decisions, though not conclusive, are entitled to great weight, because they dealt with territorial powers in operation at a time so shortly before the rendition of the decisions that the judges who rendered them well may be credited with such knowledge of the purpose of these powers and their history and application, as to make these judges peculiarly competent to decide questions relating thereto.\n The Supreme Court of Wyoming, in a very full and carefully drawn opinion, reached the conclusion that a statute of that territory defining and punishing the crime of bigamy was valid and enforceable, notwithstanding the fact that an act of Congress defined and prescribed punishment for the same crime when committed in any of the territories. In re Murphy, 5 Wyo. 297, 40 P. 398. Following its discussion in respect of the relations between the national and territorial governments, and the extensive powers which had been conferred upon the latter, that court (5 Wyo. 297, at page 315, 40 P. 398, 404) con- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 267]\n\u00a0\n cluded: 'the crime of bigamy as defined and punishable by act of congress, is a crime against the sovereignty of the United States. The act of congress embraces no express limitation upon the right of the territory to also punish the same act as an offense against it and its local laws, nor upon the local legislature to enact a law defining and providing a punishment therefor as an offense against the territorial sovereignty. As there are, in practical and legal effect, two governments, although the one emanates from the other, we are unable to perceive why the legislature of the territory, under the general grant of power with which it was invested, may not have enacted a valid law assuming to punish as a territorial offense the crime of bigamy. It does not conflict with the United States statute. It could not and did not assume to destroy the force or effect of the congressional provision. It could not have assumed to offer immunity to those desiring to contract polygamous marriages. By silence, it could only have refused to punish it as a territorial crime. To avoid this possibility, congress undertook to punish it as a crime against the federal government.' The decision was followed by the Supreme Court of Utah in State v. Norman, 16 Utah 457, 52 P. 986.\n The Wyoming and the Utah courts thought that prosecution and punishment could be had under both statutes, and attempted to justify that view by invoking the rule applicable to state and federal statutes denouncing the same criminal acts. This, of course, in the light of our later decision in the Grafton Case, is now seen to be erroneous; but the error does not affect the accuracy of the reasoning and conclusion of these courts upon the main point-that the local statute was a valid exercise of territorial power, notwithstanding the identical legislation by Congress.\n In Territory v. Guyott, 9 Mont. 46, 22 P. 134, a territorial statute making it a felony to sell, barter, or give \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 268]\n\u00a0\n intoxicating liquor to an Indian was sustained against the contention that the authority of the territory to pass the statute had been foreclosed by section 2139, U.S.Rev.Stat. (25 U.S.C.A.  241 note) which defines and punishes the same offense.\n Territory v. Long Bell Lumber Co., 22 Okl. 890, 99 P. 911, involved the validity of the anti-trust act passed by the former territorial legislature. Suits were brought against the defendants, charging violations of the territorial act, which were also violations of the Sherman Act. The court sustained the validity of the territorial act, holding that it was not repugnant to or in conflict with the federal act. In doing so, it followed the reasoning of, and relied upon, the Wyoming, Montana, and Utah decisions, above cited.\n The Supreme Court of the Territory of Arizona, in Territory v. Alexander, 11 Ariz. 172, 89 P. 514, had before it for consideration a bigamy statute like that involved in the Wyoming case, and erroneously held it to be invalid. In reaching that conclusion, it expressly rejected the Wyoming, Utah, and Montana decisions upon the authority of Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, 10 S.Ct. 299, a case which we shall presently consider.\n\n 5. \nThere is some general language in El Paso & N.E. Ry. Co. v. Gutierrez, \n215 \nU.S. 87\n, 30 S.Ct. 21, 23, and Davis v. Beason, supra, which, considered apart from the question which was involved and apart from the opinions in their entirety, seems to support the decision of the court below in the present case. The opinion of the court below and the argument of respondents here rest in the main upon these cases. An examination of them, however, will show that they have been misunderstood. The Gutierrez Case involved the validity of a statute of the Territory of New Mexico, which provided that no action for injuries inflicting death caused by any person or corporation in the territory should be maintained unless the person claiming damages should, within 90 days after the infliction \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 269]\n\u00a0\n of the injuries complained of and 30 days before commencing suit, serve upon the defendant an affidavit covering certain specified particulars. The statute also required that suit must be brought within a year and in a specified district court of the territory. The statute is set forth in full in the margin of the opinion of this court in Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55\n, 59-63, 29 S.Ct. 397. An action was brought in Taxes by Enedina Gutierrez against the railway company to recover damages for the death of her intestate. The accident causing the death happened in New Mexico, and the railway company set up the New Mexico statute by way of special plea and answer. A writ of error brought here for review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas holding that the case was controlled by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 34 Stat. 232, and refusing to give effect to the New Mexico statute-a statute which was plainly an attempted restriction upon the right of action conferred in unlimited terms by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and, therefore, in direct conflict with that act. In deciding the question, this court said that there could be no doubt that the act of Congress 'would necessarily supersede the territorial law regulating the same subject.' This is broad language; but it must be construed in the light of the question presented, which was whether a territorial act, in plain conflict with the federal act, was valid. In that situation, the applicable rule is that formulated by Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, where, speaking for this court, he said: 'It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision.' See, also, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 627\n, 55 S.Ct. 869, 873, and cases cited. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 270]\n\u00a0\n In the course of the opinion rendered by this court in Davis v. Beason, supra (\n133 \nU.S. 333\n, at page 348, 10 S.Ct. 299, 302), it was said: 'The cases in which the legislation of congress will supersede the legislation of a state or territory, without specific provisions to that effect, are those in which the same matter is the subject of legislation by both. There the action of congress may well be considered as covering the entire ground.' This generalization was not necessary to the decision of the case, and, taken literally, cannot stand, because, as in the Gutierrez Case, it omits the element of actual conflict between the two acts of legislation. The decision itself sustained the validity of a statute penalizing any person who teaches, advises, counsels, or encourages the practice of bigamy or polygamy, notwithstanding there was a general act of Congress which had for its object the suppression of bigamy and polygamy in the territories. And the court sad in its opinion ( \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, at page 341, 10 S.Ct. 299, 300), that bigamy and polygamy are 'crimes by the laws of the United States, and they are crimes by the laws of Idaho'; and, further (\n133 \nU.S. 333\n, at page 348, 10 S.Ct. 299, 302), that the act of Congress was a general law applicable to all territories and 'does not purport to restrict the legislation of the territories over kindred offenses, or over the means for their ascertainment and prevention.' Each of the two observations which we have last quoted may have gone beyond the necessities of the case and may fall within the rule announced by Chief Justice Marshall in the Cohens Case. In any event, however, they indicate that the general statement first quoted is not to be given the sweeping effect which a categorical reading of the words might at first suggest.\n Only a word need be said about Domenech v. National City Bank, \n294 \nU.S. 199\n, 55 S.Ct. 366, which the court below thought lent support to its judgment. That case involved the validity of a tax sought to be imposed by Puerto Rico upon a branch of a national bank organized under the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 253, 271]\n\u00a0\n laws of the United States. We held that section 5219 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (12 U.S.C.A.  548) was in force in Puerto Rico and that that section forbade the tax. The grant to the territory of the general power to tax did not constitute consent on the part of Congress that a tax not authorized by section 5219 could be laid; and it is upon that ground that our decision rests. The conflict between the tax and the federal law we regarded as plain.\n\n 6. \nFinally, it is contended that, if the local anti-trust act and the Sherman Act both stand, a conflict of jurisdiction between the federal courts and the local courts may result. But clearly there is slight, if any, ground for the apprehension. The local act simply confers jurisdiction upon the local courts to enforce that act. No attempt, of course, is made to confer jurisdiction upon those courts to enforce the Sherman Act, or upon the federal courts to enforce the local act. It is hard to see why a conflict as to which law shall be enforced and which jurisdiction shall be invoked should ever arise, since the officers charged with the administration and enforcement of both acts are, in the last analysis, under the control of the same sovereignty and, it well may be assumed, will work in harmony.\n We conclude that the anti-trust act of Puerto Rico is valid and enforceable; and accordingly the judgment below is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sherman Act (July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (15 U.S.C.A.  3, 4)):\n's 3.

ROGERS v. GRAVES(1937)\nNo. 139\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Court of Appeals of the State of New York. \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 402]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard Reid Rogers, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Joseph M. Mesnig, Asst. Atty. Gen., of Albany, N.Y., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The relator, Richard Reid Rogers, is general counsel for the Panama Rail Road Company, a corporation created by an old statute of the State of New York for the purpose of constructing and operating a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. In making his state income-tax return for the years 1927, 1928, and 1929, he reported the receipt of salary from the corporation during those years, but, upon the claim that the salary was exempt, paid to tax. The State Tax Commission, however, sustained the tax, and it then was paid under protest. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, to which the case was taken by certiorari, upheld the view of the Tax Commission, 245 App.Div. 452, 283 N.Y.S. 538, 545; and the decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, without opinion. 271 N.Y. 543, 2 N.E.(2d) 686.\n The ground upon which the relator claimed the exemption was that the Panama Rail Road Company was a \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n wholly-owned instrumentality of the United States, engaged in maintaining, operating and protecting the Panama Canal; that as such, the railroad company was exempt from state taxation and, in consequence, the fixed salaries paid to its officers and employees were also exempt. The Appellate Division held that the railroad company was a government- controlled corporate agency engaged in a commercial proprietary function, and was not immune from state taxation since, it said, such taxation did not hinder or restrain 'functions which are unquestionably properly and usually governmental in their character.'\n First. The corporation was privately owned and operated for many years; but in 1904, the United States acquired the entire capital stock of the corporation, and ever since has been, and now is, the sole owner thereof. The company operates a railroad across the Isthmus, conducts a commissary establishment for the benefit of the personnel of the Panama Canal, the railroad company, and the armed forces of the United States upon the Isthmus, and operates a dairy and two hotels in connection therewith. It also operates a line of steamships between New York and the Canal Zone, which ships afford the personnel of the canal and of the railroad company transportation at a nominal rate, and carry freight for the government of the United States to the Canal Zone at 25 per cent. less than the customary tariff rates.\n The acquisition by the United States of the Panama Rail Road Company was coincident with its acquisition of the control of the Panama Canal Zone and the right to construct and maintain a ship canal across it. Since the acquisition of the railroad company by the government, the directors, thirteen in number, have been elected by the Secretary of War, as sole stockholder of record of the corporate stock with the exception of thirteen qualifying shares held by the directors. \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n During the construction of the canal, the railroad was almost exclusively employed as an adjunct of such construction, although it was incidentally used also for commercial transportation across the Isthmus. In United States ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. McCarl, \n275 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 48 S.Ct. 12, 14, we said: 'For many years before the War, the government had employed the Panama Railroad Company as its instrumentality in connection with the Canal.' In a footnote following that statement, we pointed out that the stock in the railroad company was acquired in order that the railroad might be used in the manner most helpful to the government in constructing the canal, and cited public documents which sustained that view.\n In order to reach a correct determination of the question whether the railroad company is exercising functions of a governmental character, the railroad and ships are to be considered not as things apart, but in their relation to the Panama Canal; and it is clear that the railroad and ships, after the completion of the canal, continued to be used chiefly as adjuncts to its management and operation. The question, therefore, to be answered is whether the canal is such an instrumentality of the federal government as to be immune from state taxation; and, if so, are the operations of the railroad company so connected with the canal as to confer upon the company a like immunity?\n The authority for the construction of the canal and the acquisition of rights in connection therewith is found in the Act of Congress of June 28, 1902, c. 1302, 32 Stat. 481. By that act, the President was authorized to acquire for the United States all the rights and property of the New Panama Canal Company, of France, on the Isthmus of Panama, including the capital stock of the Panama Rail Road Company 'owned by or held for the use of said canal company'; to acquire from the Republic of Colombia perpetual control of the Panama Canal Zone, a strip of land six miles in width and extending across the Isth- \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n mus; and to construct and perpetually maintain, operate, and protect thereon a ship canal, including 'the right to perpetually maintain and operate the Panama Railroad.' The acquisition was to include jurisdiction over the Zone and the ports at the ends thereof, and the power to make police and sanitary rules and regulations necessary to preserve order and preserve the public health thereon; and to establish judicial tribunals necessary to enforce such rules and regulations.\n Section 7 of the act (32 Stat. 483) created a commission to carry out the purposes of the act, and authorized the employment of engineers necessary for the prosecution of the work. The commission was to be subject to the direction and control of the President, and was to make full reports of their doings, to be transmitted to Congress by the President. Section 8 (31 U.S.C.A.  744 and note) authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow, on the credit of the United States, such sums as might be required to defray expenditures authorized by the act, not to exceed $130,000,000, and to issue bonds of the United States as security therefor.\n The Act of August 24, 1912, c. 390,  4, 37 Stat. 560, 561, 48 U.S.C .  1305 (48 U.S.C.A.  1305), authorized the President to govern and operate the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone through a Governor of the 'Panama Canal' and other persons. The Governor was to be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, commissioned for a term of four years, with an annual salary of $10,000. The Governor was to have control and jurisdiction over the Zone, which was to be held, treated and governed as an adjunct of the canal. 37 Stat. 564,  7, 48 U.S.C.  1307 (48 U.S.C. A.  1307). Later legislation authorizes the President to make rules and regulations in matters of health, etc., and imposes penalties for their violation. 48 U.S.C.  1310 (48 U.S.C.A.  1310). The President is also given broad powers of police within the zone. 48 U.S.C.  1312, 1313, 1314 (48 U.S.C.A.  1312, 1313, 1314). We need not particularize further. Chapter 6, title 48 U.S.C.

California v. Central Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1, 39\n, 8 S.Ct. 1073; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., \n153 \nU.S. 525\n, 14 S.Ct. 891.\n The building and operation of a bridge or a road or a canal is not commerce in the substantive sense, but is the creation and use of a physical thing as a medium by and through which commerce is regulated, since such creation and use condition and facilitate transportation. Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., supra, \n153 U.S. 525\n, at pages 533, 534, 14 S.Ct. 891; Pensacola Tel. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., \n96 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S.; cf. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 297\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, 866, 867. In recognition of the principle established by these and other decisions, this court in Wilson v. Shaw, \n204 \nU.S. 24, 33\n, 27 S.Ct. 233, sustained the acquisition, construction and maintenance of the canal as within the commerce power of the federal government.\n Such being the status of the canal, it requires no argument to demonstrate that all auxiliaries primarily designed and used to aid in its management and operation, and which have that effect, partake of its nature and are themselves cooperating regulators-or, perhaps more accurately speaking, constitute, with the canal, a single great regulator- of national and international commerce. And this, we think, is the effect of the interrelation of the railroad company's activities with the management and operation of the canal.\n If support for this view were thought necessary, it could be found in the contemporaneous and long- \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 407]\n\u00a0\n -continued administrative practice. On April 27, 1928, the Secretary of War, in a letter to the President, said: 'The (steamship) Line is an integral part of the Panama Canal and indispensable in its discharge of its normal responsibilities. The successful operation of this great enterprise, which is of vital importance to the United States, demands absolute security as to its line of supply to this country.'\n Section 500 of the War Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 314) levied a tax upon sums paid for transportation by rail and water, but exempted (40 Stat. 315,  502) therefrom payments received for services rendered to the United States, etc. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that transportation services performed for the Panama Rail Road Company fell within the exemption, on the ground that they were 'in substance payments for services rendered the United States.'\n Article 96, Department Regulations No. 49, revision of June, 1921, declares that transportation services rendered to agencies of the United States are exempt from the tax, and enumerates as among such agencies the Panama Rail Road Company. The commissioner had likewise held that the railroad company was not subject to the capital stock tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1918,  1000 (40 Stat. 1126), because the company was a government agency. Again, on September 20, 1926, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue advised the company that inasmuch as it was a governmental agency, it was not required to file federal income-tax returns or to pay federal income taxes. No act of Congress suggests any different view, but all such legislation, so far as it deals with the subject, recognizes its correctness.\n We attach no importance to the fact that the railroad company has utilized both its ships and railroad to carry private freight and passengers. The record shows that this is done to a limited extent compared with the government business; and that it is only incidental to the \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 408]\n\u00a0\n governmental operations. The primary purpose of the enterprise being legitimately governmental, its incidental use for private purposes affords no ground for objection. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 73\n, 33 S.Ct. 667; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 333\n, 56 S.Ct. 466, 476. The first of these two cases dealt with the disposition of excess water power developed by a project to improve navigation; and the second with the disposition of surplus electric energy developed by a like project. But the principle is equally applicable to the situation here.\n It is suggested that the dairy, hotels, and other enterprises, built and maintained by the company, are not governmental instrumentalities. Even if we accept that conclusion-which, in view of their use for the personnel of the railroad and canal, we are far from doing-it would not alter the fact that the railroad itself, in connection with the canal, is a federal instrumentality.\n Second. The power of the federal government to use a corporation as a means to carry into effect the substantive powers granted by the Constitution has never been doubted since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. The Panama Rail Road Company was acquired and has been utilized in virtue of that power. The railroad company being immune from state taxation, it necessarily results that fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.\n In Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, 448, 449, this court held that a state was without authority to tax the instruments, or compensation of persons, which the United States may use and employ as necessary and proper means to execute its sovereign power. The rule is well established; and the reasons upon which it is based and the authorities sustaining it have been so recently reviewed by this Court, Indian \n\n[299 U.S. 401, 409]\n\u00a0\n Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 575\n, 51 S.Ct. 601, 602, et seq., that further discussion is unnecessary.\n The rule itself is not denied; but it was suggested in the court below by counsel for the state, and the suggestion was repeated here, albeit faintly, that the record does not establish whether relator was an officer or employee of the railroad company or an independent contractor. The point was not made or suggested either before the State Tax Commission or in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. The whole question there was whether the company was subject to taxation; and it quite evidently was taken for granted that a negative answer to that question would carry with it an exemption of relator's salary. It is conceded that the point was raised by counsel for the state for the first time in the Court of Appeals; and that in reply to a question from that bench whether he wished the case decided upon that point, counsel answered in the negative and declared that the state wanted a decision upon the merits.\n Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the obligation of the relator to prove his case in this regard was somewhat perfunctorily discharged. The record, however, does show that relator was, and had been ever since the year 1906, general counsel for the railroad company with a fixed annual salary, in the same category in respect of the railroad company as the secretary and treasurer. We think this evidence sufficiently negatives the belated suggestion that relator may have been an independent contractor and not an officer, within the rule stated and discussed in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 U.S. 514\n, 524-526, 46 S.Ct. 172, 174, 175.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK V. GRAVES(1937)\nNo. 404\nArgued: February 3, 1937Decided: March 1, 1937\n\n\n  Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of New York.\n  Mr. Maurice Cohn, of New York City, for appellant.[ People of State of New York v. Graves   \n300 \nU.S. 308\n (1937)   ]\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 310]\n\u00a0\n  Mr. Joseph M. Mesnig, of Albany, N.Y., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents the question whether a state may constitutionally tax a resident upon income received from rents of land located without the state and from interest on bonds physically without the state and secured by mortgages upon lands similarly situated. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 311]\n\u00a0\n  Section 351 of article 16 of the New York Tax Law, Consol.Laws c. 60 ( as added by N.Y.Laws 1919, c. 627), imposes a tax upon the 'entire net income' of residents of the state. By section 359 gross income is defined as including interest and rent. The same section, as amended by N.Y. Laws 1935, c. 933, enumerates among the items of taxable income 'rent ( including rent derived from real property situated outside the state) * * * it being intended to include all of the foregoing items, without regard to the source thereof, location of the property involved, or any other factor, except only a case where the inclusion thereof would be violative of constitutional restrictions.'\n  Appellant, a resident of New York, brought the present certiorari proceeding in the courts of New York to review a determination of the State Tax Commission, appellees, denying her application for a refund of state income taxes assessed and paid for the years 1931 and 1932, so far as the taxes were attributable to rents received by appellant from New Jersey land, and interest paid on bonds secured by mortgaged real estate in New Jersey, where the bonds and mortgages were physically located. A ground for recovery of the tax assigned by appellant's petition was that the tax was in substance and effect a tax on real estate and tangible property located without the state, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Judgment for appellant ( see 246 App.Div. 335, 286 N.Y.S. 485), was reversed by the New York Court of Appeals, 271 N.Y. 353, 3 N.E.(2d) 508. The case comes here on appeal under section 327(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 \nU.S.C.A.  344(a).\n  The stipulation of facts on which the case was tried in the state court does not indicate that appellant's income has been taxed by New Jersey, and it does not define the precise nature of her interest in the properties producing the income. It sets out that appellant's husband died testate, his will duly probated in New \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 312]\n\u00a0\n Jersey 'devising and bequeathing to said taxpayer the entire net income from his estate for and during her widowhood,' and that the taxed income included 'rents from testator's real estate' and 'interest from testator's real estate mortgages,' all located in New Jersey. The terms of the will and the status of the estate during the tax years do not otherwise appear. There is nothing to show that the incomeproducing properties were in those years held upon an active trust, or that appellant did not receive the income as life tenant of the legal interest. See Paletz v. Camden Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 109 N.J.Eq. 344, 157 A. 456; cf. Passman v. Guarantee Trust & Safe-Deposit Co., 57 N.J.Eq. 273, 41 A. 953; Westfield Trust Co. v. Beekman, 97 N.J.Eq. 140, 128 A. 791. Any uncertainty arising from the ambiguity of the stipulation, if it has any present significance, is put at rest by the concession of appellant in brief, and in open court on the argument, that she is the owner of a life estate or interest in the properties, and that she received, as a part of her income in the tax years, the rents and interest which have been collected by the executors acting, not in their capacity as executors, but as her agents for an annual compensation.\n  In any case we may assume, for present purposes, that New York may not levy a property tax upon appellant's interest, whether it be legal or equitable, see Senior v. Braden, \n295 \nU.S. 422, 100\n A.L.R. 794; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 67\n A.L.R. 386. We accordingly limit our review to the question considered and decided by the state court, whether there is anything in the Fourteenth Amendment which precludes the State of New York from taxing the income merely because it is derived from sources, which, to the extent indicated, are located outside the state.\n  Income from rents. That the receipt of income by a resident of the territory of a taxing sovereignty is a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 313]\n\u00a0\n taxable event is universally recognized. Domicil itself affords a basis for such taxation. Enjoyment of the privileges of residence in the state and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws are inseparable from responsibility for sharing the costs of government. 'Taxes are what we pay for civilized society,' see Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 100\n, 105. A tax measured by the net income of residents is an equitable method of distributing the burdens of government among those who are privileged to enjoy its benefits. The tax, which is apportioned to the ability of the taxpayer to pay it, is founded upon the protection afforded by the state to the recipient of the income in his person, in his right to receive the income and in his enjoyment of it when received. These are rights and privileges which attach to domicil within the state. To them and to the equitable distribution of the tax burden, the economic advantage realized by the receipt of income and represented by the power to control it, bears a direct relationship. See Lawrence v. State Tax Comm., \n286 \nU.S. 276, 52\n S. Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374; Maguire v. Trefry, \n253 \nU.S. 12, 14\n, 418; Virginia v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., \n293 \nU.S. 15, 19\n, 13; compare Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 50\n, 224.\n  Neither the privilege nor the burden is affected by the character of the source from which the income is derived. For that reason income is not necessarily clothed with the tax immunity enjoyed by its source. A state may tax its residents upon net income from a business whose physical assets, located wholly without the state, are beyond its taxing power. Lawrence v. State Tax Comm., supra; see Shaffer v. Carter, supra, \n252 \nU.S. 37\n, at page 50, 224. It may tax net income from bonds held in trust and administered in another state, Maguire v. Trefry, supra, although the taxpayer's equitable interest may not be subjected to the tax, Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra. It may tax net income from operations in interstate commerce, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 314]\n\u00a0\n although a tax on the commerce is forbidden, United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, Ann.Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, supra. Congress may lay a tax on net income derived from the business of exporting merchandise in foreign commerce, although a tax upon articles exported is prohibited by constitutional provision (article 1,  9, cl. 5). Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 38\n S. Ct. 432; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 45 S. Ct. 348.\n  Neither analysis of the two types of taxes, nor consideration of the bases upon which the power to impose them rests, supports the contention that a tax on income is a tax on the land which produces it. The incidence of a tax on income differs from that of a tax on property. Neither tax is dependent upon the possession by the taxpayer of the subject of the other. His income may be taxed, although he owns no property, and his property may be taxed, although it produces no income. The two taxes are measured by different standards, the one by the amount of income received over a period of time, the other by the value of the property at a particular date. Income is taxed but once; the same property may be taxed recurrently. The tax on each is predicated upon different governmental benefits; the protection offered to the property in one state does not extend to the receipt and enjoyment of income from it in another.\n  It would be pressing the protection which the due process clause throws around the taxpayer too far to say that because a state is prohibited from taxing land which it neither protects nor controls, it is likewise prohibited from taxing the receipt and command of income from the land by its resident, who is subject to its control and enjoys the benefits of its laws. The imposition of these different taxes, by the same or different states, upon these distinct and separable taxable interests, is not subject to the objection of double taxation, which has been successfully urged in those cases where two or more states have \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 315]\n\u00a0\n laid the same tax upon the same property interest in intangibles or upon its transfer at death. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 65\n A.L.R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 72\n A.L.R. 1303; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 77\n A.L.R. 1401. These considerations lead to the conclusion that income derived from real estate may be taxed to the recipient at the place of his domicil, irrespective of the location of the land, and that the state court rightly upheld the tax.\n  Nothing which was said or decided in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, calls for a different conclusion. There the question for decision was whether a federal tax on income derived from rents of land is a direct tax requiring apportionment under article 1, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution. In holding that the tax was 'direct,' the Court did not rest its decision upon the ground that the tax was a tax on the land, or that it was subject to every limitation which the Constitution imposes on property taxes. It determined only that for purposes of apportionment there were similarities in the operation of the two kinds of tax which made it appropriate to classify both as direct, and within the constitutional command. See Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, 157 \nU.S. pp. 580, 581; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, L.R.A.1917D, 414, Ann.Cas.1917B, 713. And in Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 4 Ann.Cas. 493, decided ten years after the Pollock Case, the present question was thought not to be foreclosed.\n  It is by a parity of reasoning that the immunity of income-producing instrumentalities of one government, state or national, from taxation by the other, has been extended to the income. It was thought that the tax, whether on the instrumentality or on the income produced by it, would equally burden the operations of government. See Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124; Pollock \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 316]\n\u00a0\n v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra, \n157 \nU.S. 429, 583\n; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n. But as we have seen, it does not follow that a tax on land and a tax on income derived from it are identical in their incidence or rest upon the same basis of taxing power, which are controlling factors in determining whether either tax infringes due process.\n  In Senior v. Braden, supra, on which appellant relies, no question of the taxation of income was involved. By concession of counsel, on which the Court rested its opinion, if the interest taxed was 'land or an interest in land situate within or without the state,' the tax was invalid, and the Court held that the interest represented by the certificates subjected to the tax was an equitable interest in the land. Here the subject of the tax is the receipt of income by a resident of the taxing state, and is within its taxing power, even though derived from property beyond its reach.\n  Income from bonds secured by New Jersey mortgages. What has been said of the power to tax income from land without the state is decisive of the objection to the taxation of the income from interest on bonds because they are secured by mortgages on land without the state, compare Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 \nU.S. 491\n. Appellant also argues that the interest from the bonds is immune from taxation by New York because they have acquired a business situs in New Jersey within the doctrine of New Orleans v. Stemple, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 \nU.S. 395\n; Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 193\n. This contention, if pertinent to the present case, is not supported by the record. The stipulation of facts discloses only that the bonds and mortgages were located in New Jersey. See Baldwin v. Missouri, supra; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15, 415. The burden rested on the taxpayer to present further facts which would establish a 'business situs.' Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 55. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 317]\n\u00a0\n  Retroactive application of the tax. Appellant insists that in upholding the tax upon her income for 1931 and 1932 the state court infringed due process by giving retroactive effect to the 1935 amendment of section 359 of the New York Tax Law, which specifically declared that rents, embraced in taxable income by the section before amendment, should include rent from real property without the state. In support of this contention appellant points to the decision in People ex rel. Pierson v. Lynch, 266 N.Y. 431, 195 N.E. 141, affirming Pierson v. Lynch, 237 App.Div. 763, 263 N.Y.S. 259, that rents from land outside the state were not taxed by that section before its amendment, and to the dismissal by this Court of the writ of certiorari to review the judgment for want of a properly presented federal question. Lynch v. State of New York ex rel. Pierson, \n293 \nU.S. 52\n.\n  It is unnecessary for us to determine whether, or to what extent, the state court, in sustaining the tax in this case, rested its decision on the amendment of 1935, or whether it regarded it as anything more than a clarifying act pointing out the meaning properly attributable to the section before amendment. The record does not disclose that appellant raised in the state court the objection, which she presses here, to the retroactive application of the statute. In reviewing the judgment of a state court, this Court will not pass upon any federal question not shown by the record to have been raised in the state court or considered there, whether it be one arising under a different or the same clause in the constitution with respect to which other questions are properly presented. Bolln v. Nebraska, \n176 \nU.S. 83\n; People of State of New York ex rel. Rosevale Realty Co. v. Kleinert, \n268 \nU.S. 646\n; Saltonstall v.

I am of opinion that the rents received by appellant for the use of real estate in New Jersey may not be included in her taxable income. By \n\n[300 \nU.S. 308\n, 318]\n\u00a0\n our decisions it is established that a tax on income received for the use of land is in legal effect a tax upon the land itself. Pollock v.

Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, ubi supra.\n  Appellant's right to own, or to collect rents in New Jersey for the use of, lands in that state was not given and is not protected by New York law. Neither of these rights is enjoyed in New York or has any relation to appellant's privilege of residence in, or to the protection of, that state. Ability of taxpayers to pay may be taken into account for apportionment of the tax burdens that it is authorized to impose. But the financial means of those to be taxed cannot be made to generate for the state power to tax lands, or rents paid for use of lands, beyond its borders. I would exclude the item.\n  Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK v.

Bennett, Jr., Atty. Gen., and Henry Epstein, Sol. Gen., of Albany, N.Y., on the brief), for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here presented relates to the constitutional validity of a tax imposed by the State of New York upon the profits realized by a nonresident upon the sale of a right appurtenant to membership in the New York Stock Exchange.\n The relator, C. Handasyde Whitney, is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a member of a firm doing business in Boston. He and his copartners own a membership in the New York Stock Exchange. The membership stands in the relator's name. In 1929, by virtue of an increase in the number of members of the Exchange, each member became entitled to a 'right' to one-fourth of a new membership. The relator sold that right for $ 108,000. The Tax Commission of New York, under sections 351 and 351-a of the Tax Law of that State (Consol.Laws, c. 60), assessed a tax upon the profits derived from the sale, which were calculated at the difference between original cost, together with contributions paid in the form of dues, and the proceeds of the sale. The tax was paid under protest, and the relator sought revision under the pertinent provision of the state law. The Tax Commission denied the application. The relator then obtained a writ of certiorari from the state court to review the Commission's action and the Commission made return embracing the record of its proceedings. In accordance with the state practice, the matter was heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court which sustained the determination of the Commission. 246 App.Div. 652, 283 N.Y.S. 219. That ruling was affirmed by the Court of \n\n[299 U.S. 366, 370]\n\u00a0\n Appeals, without opinion. Subsequently that court amended its remittitur by reciting that upon the appeal the relator contended that the assessment of the tax under the provisions of the state act 'contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution as an extraterritorial tax, and such question was presented and necessarily passed upon but not sustained by the court.' 271 N.Y. 594, 3 N.E.(2d) 201; 271 N.Y. 618, 3 N.E.( 2d) 213. The case comes here on appeal.\n Aside from a brief statement of facts, the state courts have not aided us by a discussion or analysis of the nature of the right involved or the grounds for the assertion of the authority to lay the tax. From the record it appears that the New York Stock Exchange is an unincorporated voluntary association, limited as to membership and governed by its own constitution, by-laws and rules; that it holds the beneficial ownership of the entire capital stock of a New York corporation which owns the building in which the business of the Exchange is transacted, with the land upon which it stands, situated in the city of New York; that membership or seat in the Exchange carries with it valuable privileges and has a market value for the purpose of sale; that the Exchange is supported by dues and charges paid by its members and that contributions are also made to a 'gratuity fund' which is in substance an insurance fund for the benefit of the widow and descendants of deceased members; that membership is evidenced by a certificate in the form of a letter signed by the secretary of the Exchange; that the membership can be transferred only through the Exchange and with its approval; that a member may personally buy or sell only in the Exchange building; that a member may buy or sell for the account of other members at a commission substantially less than that charged to a non-member; and that such rights and privileges are valuable and are exer- \n\n[299 U.S. 366, 371]\n\u00a0\n cisable only in transactions conducted at the Exchange building in the city of New York. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The relator, in challenging the jurisdiction of the State of New York to lay the tax, stresses the points that the relator and his copartners have always been domiciled in Massachusetts; that they have never had an office or abode in New York and have never carried on business there; that while they advertise themselves in Boston as members of the New York Stock Exchange and accept orders from customers at their Boston office for execution on the New York Stock Exchange, none of that business is conducted by the relator or his copartners on the floor of that Exchange; that they do not buy and sell securities on the Exchange for their firm account; that orders requiring execution on the Exchange are telegraphed to members of the Exchange who have business offices in New York and who execute their orders on the Exchange in their own names, acting as correspondents, lending money on the security of the stock purchased and other collateral delivered to them. This business of relator's firm in 1929 involved approximately $150,000,000 worth of securities. And it appears that by reason of relator's membership in the Exchange, his firm was able to have their New York correspondents execute orders at 40 per cent. of the commission fixed for nonmembers. Relator's firm charges its customers the fixed minimum commissions which they would have to pay any stock exchange house, and these commissions are divided with their New York correspondents by mutual agreement.\n The relator's argument is that the membership in the Exchange is intangible personal property, that as a gen- \n\n[299 U.S. 366, 372]\n\u00a0\n eral rule property of that sort is taxable only at the domicile of the owner, and that unless the membership has a 'business situs' in New York it is not taxable there. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 213\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 101, 65 A.L.R. 1000; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S.Ct. 54, 55; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312, 329\n, 331 S., 52 S.Ct. 174, 177, 178, 77 A.L.R. 1401; Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, \n298 U.S. 193\n, 209-211, 56 S.Ct. 773, 776, 777. He contends that the membership cannot be said to have a business situs in New York because he and his copartners reside and transact all their business in Massachusetts.\n We think that the argument fails to give adequate consideration to the nature and incidents of the membership. When we speak of a 'business situs' of intangible property in the taxing State we are indulging in a metaphor. We express the idea of localization by virtue of the attributes of the intangible right in relation to the conduct of affairs at a particular place. The right may grow out of the actual transactions of a localized business or the right may be identified with a particular place because the exercise of the right is fixed exclusively or dominantly at that place. In the latter case the localization for the purpose of transacting business may constitute a business situs quite as clearly as the conduct of the business itself.\n Here. we are dealing with an intangible right of a peculiar nature. It embraces the privilege of a member to transact business on the Exchange as well as a valuable right of property which is the subject of transfer with the approval of the Exchange and may survive resignation, expulsion or death. \n2\n In both aspects the right is held and can be exercised only in subjection to the constitution, by-laws and rules of the Exchange. The Exchange is a market place. The privilege which inheres in the mem- \n\n[299 U.S. 366, 373]\n\u00a0\n bership is the right to conduct transactions at that market place. That privilege of conducting the business of the buying and selling of securities on the floor of the Exchange is the dominant feature of the membership or 'seat.' Its very nature localizes it at the Exchange. It is a privilege which can be exercised nowhere else. The nature of that right is not altered by the failure to exercise it. Wherever the owner may reside he must go to the Exchange to exercise his privilege to trade upon its floor. If he prefers to have his customers' orders executed through other members, still they must execute these orders on the Exchange under its rules. Such orders are executed on his behalf, and by virtue of his membership and of the execution of his orders upon the Exchange he becomes entitled to the concession in commissions for which the rules provide.\n Our decisions do not support the relator's contention. In Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n240 \nU.S. 184\n, 36 S.Ct. 265, the question related to memberships in the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Minneapolis. It was urged on behalf of the citizens of other states that their memberships were intangible rights held at their domicile. But we decided that they were taxable in Minnesota. While it was said that the memberships represented rights and privileges which appeared to have been actually exercised at the Exchange in Minneapolis, the underlying consideration was the nature of the right and privilege which made those transactions possible. In Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99\n, 42 S.Ct. 15, a membership in the New York Stock Exchange, owned by a resident of Ohio, was held to be subject to taxation at his domicile. But the Court was careful not to question the jurisdiction of the State of New York to tax 'the membership privileges exercisable locally' in that state (Id., \n257 U.S. 99\n, at pages 109, 111, 42 S.Ct. 15, 16, 17) and what the Court said with respect to double taxation must be read in the light of the decisions in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minne- \n\n[299 U.S. 366, 374]\n\u00a0\n sota, supra, and later cases upon that point. See Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, supra.\n We think that the dominant attribute of relator's membership in the New York Stock Exchange so links it to the situs of the Exchange as to localize it at that place and hence to bring it within the taxing power of New York. Accordingly, we hold that in laying the tax upon the profits derived by the relator from the sale of the right appurtenant to his membership the State did not exceed the bounds of its jurisdiction. The judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Belton v.

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOWN OF WEST NEW YORK(1937)\nNo. 454\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1937\n\n\n  Appeals from the Court of Errors and Appeals of the State of New jersey. [ Phelps v. Board of Education of Town of West New York   \n300 \nU.S. 319\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 319\n, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. Robert H. McCarter, of Newark, N.J., for appellants.\n  Mr. Saul Nemser, of Jersey City, N.J., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The people of New Jersey have ordained by their Constitution that the Legislature 'shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of the public schools.'1 In fulfillment of this command a comprehensive school law was adopted in 1903 by which boards of education were set up for cities, towns, and school districts throughout the state. \n2\n Section 106 empowered these boards to make rules and regulations governing engagement and employment of teachers and principals, terms and tenure of such employment, promotion, and dismissal, salaries and their time and mode of payment, and to change and repeal such rules and regulations from time to time. 3 This general school law was amended by the Act of April 21, 1909,4 section 1 of which provides (4 N.J.Comp.St. 1910, p. 4763,  106a): 'The service of all teachers, principals, supervising principals of the public schools in any school district of this state shall be during good behavior and efficiency, after the expiration of a period of employment of three consecutive years in that district, unless a shorter period is fixed by the employing board. * * * No principal or \n\n[300 \nU.S. 319\n, 321]\n\u00a0\n teacher shall be dismissed or subjected to reduction of salary in said school district except for inefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher or other just cause, and after a written charge of the cause or causes shall have been preferred against him or her, * * * and after the charge shall have been examined into and found true in fact by said board of education, upon reasonable notice to the person charged, who may be represented by counsel at the hearing.'\n  An Act of February 4, 1933,5 premising that existing economic conditions require that boards of education be enabled to fix and determine the amount of salary to be paid to persons holding positions in the respective school districts, authorizes each board to fix and determine salaries to be paid officers and employes for the period July 1, 1933, to July 1, 1934, 'notwithstanding any such person be under tenure'; prohibits increase of salaries within the period named; forbids discrimination between individuals in the same class of service in the fixing of salaries or compensation; and sets a minimum beyond which boards may not go in the reduction of salaries. June 23, 1933, the board adopted a resolution reducing salaries for the school year July 1, 1933, to July 1, 1934, by a percentage of the existing salaries graded upward in steps as the salaries increased in amount, except with respect to clerks, the compensation of each of whom was reduced to a named amount.\n  Appellants, who were principals, teachers, and clerks employed by the appellee, petitioned the Department of Public Instruction, in accordance with the school law, praying that the action of the board be set aside. The Commissioner of Education dismissed the petition and, upon appeal from his action, the State Board of Education affirmed the decision. The appellants applied for certiorari from the Supreme Court, assigning among other \n\n[300 \nU.S. 319\n, 322]\n\u00a0\n reasons that the decision violated article 1, section 10, and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution. The writs6 issued and, after hearing, the court affirmed the action of the administrative tribunal. 7 The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the judgment upon the opinion of the Supreme Court. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n  The position of the appellants is that by virtue of the Act of 1909 three years of service under contract confer upon an employe of a school district a contractual status indefinite in duration which the legislature is powerless to alter or to authorize the board of education to alter. The Supreme Court holds that the Act of 1909 'established a legislative status for teachers, but we fail to see that it established a contractual one that the Legislature may not modify. * * * The status of tenure teachers, while in one sense perhaps contractual, is in essence dependent on a statute, like that of the incumbent of a statutory office, which the Legislature at will may abolish, or whose emoluments it may change.'\n  This court is not bound by the decision of a state court as to the existence and terms of a contract, the obligation of which is asserted to be impaired, but where a statute is claimed to create a contractual right we give weight to the construction of the statute by the courts of the state. \n9\n Here those courts have concurred in holding that the act of 1909 did not amount to a legislative contract \n\n[300 \nU.S. 319\n, 323]\n\u00a0\n with the teachers of the state and did not become a term of the contracts entered into with employes by boards of education. Unless these views are palpably erroneous we should accept them.\n  It appears from a stipulation of facts submitted in lieu of evidence that after a teacher has served in a school district under yearly contracts for three years it has not been customary to enter into further formal contracts with such teacher. From time to time, however, promotions were granted and salary raised for the ensuing year by action of the board. In the case of many of the appellants there have been several such increases in salary.\n  Although after the expiration of the first three years of service the employe continued in his then position and at his then compensation unless and until promoted or given an increase in salary for a succeeding year, we find nothing in the record to indicate that the board was bound by contract with the teacher for more than the current year. The employe assumed no binding obligation to remain in service beyond that term. Although the act of 1909 prohibited the board, a creature of the state, from reducing the teacher's salary or discharging him without cause, we agree with the courts below that this was but a regulation of the conduct of the board and not a term of a continuing contract of indefinite duration with the individual teacher.\n  The resolution of June 23, 1933, grouped the existing salaries paid by the board into six classes the lowest of which comprised salaries between $1200 and $1999; and the highest included salaries ranging between $ 4000 and $5600. The reduction in the lowest class for the coming year was 10 per cent; that in the highest class 15 per cent. Salaries in the intermediate classes were reduced 11, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 319\n, 324]\n\u00a0\n 12, 13, and 14 per cent. It resulted that in some instances a teacher receiving the lowest salary in a given bracket would have his compensation reduced to a figure lower than the reduced compensation of one receiving the highest salary in the next lower bracket. From this circumstance it is argued that the board's action arbitrarily discriminated between the employes and so denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  We think it was reasonable and proper that the teachers employed by the board should be divided into classes for the application of the percentage reduction. All in a given class were treated alike. Incidental individual inequality resulting in some instances from the operation of the plan does not condemn it as an unreasonable or arbitrary method of dealing with the problem of general salary reductions or deny the equality guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  Judgments affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 4,  7, par. 6, 1 N.J.Comp.St.1910, p. lxxv.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of Oct. 19, 1903, Laws of N.J.1904, 1905, 4 N.J.Comp.St.1910, p. 4724 et seq.,  1 et seq.  \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 4 N.J.Comp.St.1910, p. 4762,  106.  \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Chapter 243, N.J.Laws 1909, Pamph.

PARMLEY(1937)\nNo. 45\nArgued: November 19, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert T. McCracken, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Herman Goldman, of New York City, for petitioners. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Margaret Wilkinson, a respondent, pro se.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question for decision is the stockholder's right to contribution.\n In 1919, the Coombs Garment Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, would up its affairs and distributed its assets ratably among its eleven stockholders. In 1924 and 1925, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed against the company additional income and profits taxes for the years 1918 and 1919. To the extent of $9,306.36 these taxes remained unpaid. I. L. Phillips, a stockholder resident in New York City, had received in 1919 liquidating dividends in excess of that amount. In 1926, the Commissioner notified Phillips that it was proposed to assess against him as transferee of the corporation's assets this sum of $9,306.36, pursuant to section 280(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 61). No notice of the deficiency was sent by the Commissioner to any of the other stockholders; no assessment was made against any of them; and no proceeding was instituted by him against any of them.\n Phillips having died, his executors contested the deficiency assessed against the company and both the validity and the amount of the assessment made against him, insisting, among other things, that in no event could Phillips' estate be held liable for more than his pro rata portion of the unpaid tax of the company. The Commissioner adhering to his determination, the executors sought a review by the Board of Tax Appeals. It held Phillips' estate liable for the full amount. Phillips v. Commissioner, 15 B.T.A. 1218. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that judgment. 42 F.2d \n\n[302 \nU.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n 177. And, in Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, 51 S.Ct. 608, we affirmed the judgment of that court.\n The Phillips-Jones Corporation, which was the real owner of the stock standing in Phillips' name, paid the judgment and the expenses of the litigation. Then it and Phillips' executors brought, in the federal court for Eastern Pennsylvania, this suit in equity for contribution against the eight stockholders or their representatives, resident in that state. The District Court dismissed the bill for want of equity, on the ground that liability for the taxes arose solely from assessment under section 280; and that since the defendant stockholders had never been assessed they were not liable for contribution. In affirming that judgment, the Circuit Court of Appeals said (88 F.2d 958, 959): 'Any stockholder, including the appellees, should be and in our opinion is, entitled to an assessment by the Commissioner prior to imposition of tax liability upon him. The appellants would by implication add another method of imposing an assessment upon the stockholder, namely, by an action for contribution. It is not for the courts to extend the methods prescribed by Congress for imposing tax liability. In the absence of assessment against the several appellees by the Commissioner, or, a decree or judgment of a court of record imposing tax liability upon them at the instance of the Commissioner, the liability to contribution in relief of the appellant is not established.'\n We granted certiorari. \n301 \nU.S. 680\n, 57 S.Ct. 942. The injustice of allowing the other stockholders to escape contribution is obvious. And there is nothing in the applicable statutes, or the unwritten law, which compels our doing so.\n First. The liability of the stockholders for the taxes was not created by section 280. It does not originate in an assessment made thereunder. Long before the enactment it had been settled under the trust fund doctrine \n\n[302 \nU.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n (see Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398, 402\n, 403 S., 41 S.Ct. 365, 366, 367) that if the assets of a corporation are distributed among the stockholders before all its debts are paid, each stockholder is liable severally to creditors, to the extent of the amount received by him; and that as between all stockholders similarly situated the burden of paying the debts shall be borne ratably. But because the Commissioner was free to pursue Phillips alone for the entire amount of the unpaid taxes, Phillips could not compel him to join other stockholders in the proceeding, as was said in Phillips v. Commissioner, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, at page 604, 51 S.Ct. 608, 614: 'Whatever the petitioners' rights to contribution may be against other stockholders who have also received shares of the distributed assets, the government is not required, in collecting its revenue, to marshal the assets of a dissolved corporation so as to adjust the rights of the various stockholders.'\n Second. The right of a stockholder transferee to contribution arises under the general law and does not differ from that of any other person who has paid more than his fair share of a common burden. The right to sue for contribution does not depend upon a prior determination that the defendants are liable. Whether they are liable is the matter to be decided in the suit. To recover a plaintiff must prove both that there was a common burden of debt and that he has, as between himself and the defendants, paid more than his fair share of the common obligations. \n1\n Every defendant may, of course, set up any defense personal to him. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n Since the enactment of section 280, as before, a bill in equity against a stockholder transferee is a remedy available to the Commissioner to enforce the tax liability of the corporation. Leighton v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 506\n, 53 S.Ct. 719; Hulburd v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 300, 303\n, 56 S.Ct. 197, 199. If he had resorted to that remedy he could have sued Phillips alone (see Phillips v. Commissioner, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, at pages 603, 604, 51 S.Ct. 608, 614); and if thereupon Phillips had paid the entire tax, obviously he could have brought a bill in equity against the other stockholder for contribution. \n2\n The right is no less where the Commissioner proceeds under section 280. This statute does not affect the duty of other stockholder transferees to contribute; it merely provides the Commissioner with a summary remedy for enforcing existing tax liability. Phillips v. Commissioner, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, at pages 592, 594, 51 S.Ct. 608, 609, 610. As an incident of this summary remedy, the Commissioner must make an assessment against the stockholder or stockholders whom he elects to pursue. But, as each stockholder transferee is severally liable to the extent of the assets received by him, the Commissioner may pursue only one and need not make an assessment against other transferees. He elected to proceed only against Phillips; and as he succeeded in obtaining payment of the whole tax from Phillips' estate, he had no occasion to make an assessment against other stockholders. Indeed, after the corporation's tax had been paid he had no power to do so.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Lidderdale v. Robinson, 12 Wheat. 594; Wright v.

The tariff extended Fort Benning Junction switching limits to include receiving and delivery tracks at Fort Benning military post.

The Commission appeared and by its answer supported the order. The Central intervened; its answer contained, in what purports to be a counterclaim under Equity Rule 30 (28 \nU.S.C.A. following section 723), allegations appropriate for a complaint in a suit under section 1(20) of the Act to prevent a violation of section 1(18). 2 The Seaboard moved to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 280]\n\u00a0\n strike out the counterclaim on the grounds, among other things, that it is not related to the cause of action alleged in the complaint, is not pleadable under rule 30, and is not within the jurisdiction of a court of three judges under 28 \nU.S.C.  47 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  47).\n  The case was tried by a court of three, a Circuit Judge and two District Judges.

It entered a final decree denying the motion of the United States to dismiss and the motion of the Seaboard to strike out the counterclaim, declared the order valid and, in accordance with the prayer of the counterclaim, enjoined the Seaboard from extending its line from the junction to the receiving and delivery tracks at Fort Benning and from operating the line between these points without obtaining from the Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and from using the tariff and carrying out a contract for the use of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 281]\n\u00a0\n tracks between the junction and the fort as devices to avoid the need of such a certificate.\n  The questions for decision are:\n  Is the Seaboard's suit to set aside the Commission's order within the jurisdiction of the lower court? If so, may its decree upholding the order be sustained?\n  Is the Central's counterclaim against the Seaboard within the jurisdiction of the District Court of three judges under 28 \nU.S.C.  47 ( 28 \nU.S.C.A.  47)?\n  Fort Benning is a United States military post in Georgia; the reservation includes 98,000 acres and has a population of more than 7,500. A railroad 6.8 miles long, built and owned by the United States, connects receiving and delivery tracks at the post, Fort Benning, with a station, Fort Benning Junction, at the intersection of the lines of the Seaboard and the Central. For more than eight years prior to October 16, 1932, the line between the junction and Fort Benning was operated by the Central under a license granted by the Secretary of War. The Central made Fort Benning a station on its system. For transportation between the junction and that station the Central collected arbitraries fixed by it in addition to the tariff charges applicable between the junction and points of origin or destination. Most of the freight handled was inbound. The Seaboard ceased to use its connection at the junction and interchanged traffic to and from Fort Benning with the Central at Columbus, about four miles from the junction.\n  In October, 1932, the Secretary of War revoked the Central's license and arranged to have the railroad operated by contractors, Page and Harris. He leased to them the line in question, and they agreed to transport all freight to and from the junction. They undertook to organize a corporation and to have it apply to the Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to acquire and operate the line as a common carrier \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 282]\n\u00a0\n and then, by agreements with other carriers, to put in effect through routes and joint rates to and from Fort Benning as low as those to and from the junction and, out of its share of the rates so established, to take its pay for transportation performed by it.\n  Page and Harris organized the Fort Benning Railroad Company and caused it to apply for a certificate. The Seaboard gave assurances that it would join the new company in establishing through rates and divisions. The Central intervened in opposition. The application was granted by a division of the Commission. Fort Benning R. Co. Acquisition, 193 I.C.C. 223. But, on reargument before the entire Commission, the certificate was rescinded and the application denied. Id., 193 I.C.C. 517. The applicant never operated the line.\n  Shortly after the failure of the contractors' company to establish itself as a common carrier, the Seaboard filed the tariff in question, to become effective December 4, 1933. Under date of June 7, 1934, it made a contract with Page and Harris, stipulated to have been in force since the effective date of the tariff, whereby the latter agreed to act as its agents for transportation of freight between the junction and the receiving and delivery tracks named in the tariff. It agreed to pay them $ 12.50 for each loaded or partly loaded car handled in either direction or one-half of the gross revenue when the amount earned by the car was less than $25.\n  Paragraph 8 of the contract provides that when the Seaboard so desires, but subject to approval by the Secretary, it shall have the right, upon payment of reasonable compensation to Page and Harris, to perform switching service with its own engines and crews over the leased tracks. By paragraph 14 of the contract Page and Harris reserve the right, subject to the Secretary's approval, to render like service for the Central or any other common carrier. The Secretary approved \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 283]\n\u00a0\n paragraph 8 subject to the reservation in paragraph 14 and to the condition that Page and Harris should ever hold themselves out as willing and ready to contract on similar terms with the Central or any other common carrier railroad.\n  The Central's complaint initiating the proceedings which resulted in the challenged order assailed the tariff on the grounds that it and the contract with Page and Harris constitute a device to avoid the Commission's refusal to grant the Fort Benning Railroad Company a certificate of convenience and necessity; that by it the Seaboard seeks to extend its line to Fort Benning without obtaining a certificate and that it does not comply with section 6(1) because it is obscure and ambiguous and fails to state the charges to be absorbed by the Seaboard or the compensation to be paid to Page and Harris. The complaint prayed cancelation of the tariff and cease and desist orders against the Seaboard and Page and Harris. It is obvious from the allegations and prayer of the complaint, as well as from its contentions before the Commission, that the Central sought to have the Commission prohibit the use by the Seaboard or its agents of the line between the junction and the fort because in violation of section 1(18).\n  The Commission's report states: The Seaboard employs Page and Harris as its agents and pays them for performance of transportation over the leased line and that service is common carrier service within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Central has not filed a similar tariff and does not perform or bear the cost of service corresponding to that covered by the Seaboard's tariff. Before the Seaboard could lawfully operate the line from the junction to the fort, it would have to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity. But the Commission did not decide whether, on that ground, it had jurisdiction to order the Seaboard or Page and Harris to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 284]\n\u00a0\n cease and desist or to suspend or set aside the tariff. It said (206 I.C.C. 362, at page 367): 'Our finding of unlawfulness of the tariff * * * is not predicated on the fact that the Seaboard has violated section 1(18) (49 U. S.C.A.  1 (18)), but rather on the fact that it has published rates to and from Fort Benning, a station not on its line and which cannot be reached by it or any other common carrier, and consequently it cannot pay out of its line-haul rates for a service which it is not legally obligated to perform and which it cannot perform except through the employment of the contractors with the Government.' It added that approval by the Secretary of War of the contract between the Seaboard and Page and Harris 'granted no right to the Seaboard to operate over the track in question. Manifestly the War Department could take no action on a subject matter which the Congress has placed under our exclusive jurisdiction.' The Commission did not find that the tariff imposed any unreasonable burden upon the revenues of the Seaboard or connecting carriers or that the services covered by it would be performed for less than reasonable compensation or that its use would result in any disadvantage to shippers, carriers or the public.\n  1. The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission contend that the Commission's order is not reviewable under the statute. \n3\n They do not suggest that the order is a negative one or that the Commission did not make an utterance which in form purported to be an order. But they say that it is not directed to any party; it requires no one to do or to refrain from doing any act; it could not be enforced, obeyed or disobeyed; it did not speak to the future or contemplate any future effect because, on and after the date it was made, it had no \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 285]\n\u00a0\n significance 'except as a record of a certain completed act performed by the Commission.'\n  But overemphasis upon the mere form of the order may not be permitted to obscure its purpose and effect. By it the Commission meant to put an end to the tariff in question and the service of the Seaboard according to its terms. The tariff was a rule binding the Seaboard to furnish transportation to and from the fort for charges under other tariffs applicable to and from the junction. The order would eliminate that rule and substitute for it terms of the tariffs applicable prior to its effective date. In effect the order grants the relief sought by the Central's complaint; it confines the Seaboard's service within the junction switching limits, denies leave to that carrier to furnish, and prevents it from furnishing, transportation to and from Fort Benning. Interpreted according to its purpose, the order is in substance and effect an affirmative one and therefore reviewable under the statute. Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 318; Intermountain Rate Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 476, 490\n; United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533, 539\n-541, 612; Alton R. Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 229, 237\n, 127. It is clear that the District Court of three judges had jurisdiction to entertain the Seaboard's suit.\n  2. As to the validity of the order. The Commission held the tariff violated section 6 solely because it covered service and published rates to and from a station, Fort Benning, found not to be on the line of the Seaboard. It may be assumed that, unless the record conclusively shows that the leased tracks constitute a part of the Seaboard's line within the meaning of section 6, the tariff was not authorized and the Commission's order should be sustained. In substance, the facts found are: The United States leased the line to Page and Harris. With the approval of the Secretary, the lessees were employed by the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 286]\n\u00a0\n Seaboard as its agents to transport freight over the leased tracks, and the Seaboard was given the right to perform the transportation with its own engines and crews. Page and Harris reserved the right to render for the Central and other carriers service like that furnished by them as agent of the Seaboard, and were required by the Secretary to contract with such carriers on terms similar to those made with the Seaboard. The Commission rightly held that in respect of the traffic covered by the tariff Page and Harris as the Seaboard's agents were common carriers and they and the service performed by them were subject to its jurisdiction.\n  Whether the leased tracks be, within the meaning of section 1(18) an extension or addition, or, within the meaning of section 1(22) spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, it is clear that the transportation over them by or for the Seaboard is required to be covered by a tariff filed in accordance with the Act. Section 6(7). The action of the Secretary was not inconsistent with proper exertion of the Commission's authority to grant or withhold a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the use of the leased tracks by or for the Seaboard as required by section 1(18) or to bring suit under section 1(20) to enforce that paragraph. It follows that, section 1(18) aside, the leased tracks covered by the tariff constitute a part of, and extend to or include a station on, the line of the Seaboard within the meaning of section 6. Indeed, there is nothing in the Commission's report or in the briefs of appellees that tends to give support to the view that, if section 1(18) had not been enacted, the tariff would not be valid.\n  As to the bearing of section 1(18) on the validity of the tariff. The United States and the Commission argue that the Seaboard cannot, by the arrangement for the use of the leased tracks, place Fort Benning on its line because thereby the Seaboard extends its line and section 1(18) prohibits an extension without the Commission's approval; \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 287]\n\u00a0\n that the tariff offers a service that cannot legally be performed because the extension, not having been approved, is forbidden by that paragraph. And they say that, since the carrier is required to furnish whatever service is covered by its tariffs, the inclusion of that within the Seaboard's extended switching limits would compel the carrier to perform an act prohibited by section 1(18), and this the Commission may not permit. The purpose of section 1, subds. (18) to (22) of the Act was to empower the Commission in proceedings instituted by a carrier proposing to engage in transportation over or by means of an additional or extended line authoritatively to decide whether it would be in the public interest. Unless the project is one covered by section 1(18), the Commission is not authorized by the act to consider whether it is in the public interest and, for lack of jurisdiction to determine that question, it must deny the application. Upon presentation by the carrier of application for a certificate, the Commission, for the purpose of determining whether it is authorized by the act to consider the merits, may pass incidentally upon the question whether the project is one covered by section 1(18). But the decision of that question is for the court in either a suit to set aside an order granting a certificate or in a suit under section 1(20) to enjoin a violation of section 1(18). The function of the court is to construe that paragraph; that of the Commission is to determine whether the project, if it is one covered by the paragraph, is in the public interest. The Central was not authorized by the act to initiate a proceeding before the Commission to determine whether the Seaboard's use of the leased tracks was or would be in the public interest. If application for a certificate had been made, the Central could have appeared in opposition. The Seaboard not having made application, the Central's sole remedy was a suit under section 1(20). That paragraph provides the only method for enforcing section 1(18). It de- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 288]\n\u00a0\n clares that any construction or operation contrary to section 1(18) may be enjoined at the suit of the United States, the Commission, the regulating body of the state affected or any party in interest. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Gulf, etc., Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 271\n-274-265; Piedmont & Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469, 476\n et seq., 50\u00f5s.Ct. 192, 193 et seq.; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 339; Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n; St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co. v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 76, 81\n, 82, 518; Transit Commission v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 121\n; United States v. Idaho, \n298 \nU.S. 105, 109\n, 692.\n  The contention of the United States and the Commission comes to this: Fort Benning is not a station on the Seaboard's line because by use of the tariff and the leased tracks the carrier violates section 1(18). Since the tariff extends to a station not on the carrier's line it violates section 6. Therefore the Commission rightly ordered the tariff to be stricken from its files. Plainly that begs the question. It takes for granted a violation of section 1(18), a fact not established and one which the Commission had no jurisdiction to determine. The contention is fallacious and must be rejected.\n  Plainly, the Central mistook its remedy. By its complaint against the tariff it sought an order of the Commission equivalent to a decree of court in a suit under section 1(20) enjoining the Seaboard from extending its service because contrary to section 1(18). The order, as construed and supported by appellees, is the practical equivalent of such a decree. The governing statutory provisions do not permit substitution of the Commission's order for a decree of court. The remedy provided by section 1( 20) is clearly inconsistent with a proceeding before the Commission to attain the same end. Suits under that paragraph may not be tried before three judges. Those under the Urgent Deficiencies Act (28 U.S.C.  47 (28 U.S.C.A.  47)) to set aside orders \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 289]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission cannot be tried in any other court. In suits under section 1(20), appeals must be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Appeals from District Courts of three judges must be taken to this court. The statutes cannot be construed to give the Commission, a carrier or other party seeking to enforce section 1(18) a choice of remedies; i.e., between a proceeding before the Commission to invalidate the applicable tariff and a suit under section 1(20). The latter is exclusive.\n  The gravamen of the Central's complaint is not that the Seaboard is engaging in transportation like that furnished by the Central before the Secretary revoked its license. But it is that the Seaboard does it without additional charges. There is nothing in the findings of the Commission to suggest that the tariff unduly burdens the Seaboard's revenue or that it is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory. Its findings on the Fort Benning Railroad Company's application although put in evidence are not findings in the proceeding in which was made the order in question and have no bearing on the validity of the tariff under consideration. The lower court erred in sustaining the Commission's order on the ground that the 'tariff unduly impairs the line haul revenue.' The Commission did not so find. The order cannot be sustained.\n  3. The counterclaim was not properly before the court and could not be entertained as an incident to or part of the suit to set aside the Commission's order respecting the tariff.\n  The Seaboard's bill merely assails the Commission's order. The issue between the original parties is confined to its validity. The suit is a statutory one triable only in a specially constituted court. The counterclaim is based on a violation of section 1(18); the facts alleged are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action within the jurisdiction of that court. Pittsburgh & West Va. Ry. Co. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 276\n, 290]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479, 488\n, 381. Moreover, the counterclaim does not arise out of the transaction that is the subject of the suit and is not germane or related to it. Equity Rule 30 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723) cannot reasonably be construed to authorize intervening defendants, in a suit to set aside an order of the Commission, to set up counterclaims not arising out of or related to the subject matter of the suit. That would permit complications likely to burden and impede and would be contrary to the purpose and intent of the rule. Chandler & Price Co. v. Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., \n296 \nU.S. 53, 59\n, 8. The counterclaim, not being within the jurisdiction of the specially constituted court, should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Pittsburgh & West Va. Ry. Co. v. United States, ubi supra.\n  Complainants were entitled to the judgment and decree of the specially constituted court declaring that the Commission's order striking the tariff from its files is illegal and void and setting aside and annulling the same.\n  Reversed.\n  Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n  Mr. Justice CARDOZO is of the opinion that the decree should be modified by striking the counterclaim of the intervening defendant, and as so modified, affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 6(1) 'Every common carrier * * * shall file with the commission * * * schedules showing all * * * charges for transportation between different points on its own route and between points on its own route and points on the route of any other carrier by railroad * * * when a through route and joint rate have been established. * * * The schedules * * * shall plainly state the places between which property * * * will be carried * * * and * * * state separately all terminal charges * * * and all other charges which the commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations which in any wise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such * * * charges, or the value of the service rendered.' 49 U.S.C.A.  6(1).\n  Section 6(7) 'No carrier * * * shall engage or participate in the transportation of * * * property * * * unless the * * * charges * * * have been filed * * * nor shall any carrier * * * collect * * * different compensation for such transportation * * * or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs than the * * * charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time.' 49 U.S.C.A.  6(7).  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 1(18) 'No carrier by railroad * * * shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, or shall acquire or operate any line of railroad, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transportation under this chapter over or by means of such additional or extended line of railroad, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line of railroad.' 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18).\n  Section 1(20) 'Any construction, (or) operation * * * contrary to the provisions of * * * paragraph (18) * * * may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the commission, any commission or regulating body of the State or States affected, or any party in interest.' 49 U.S.C.A.  1(20).\n  Section 1(22) 'The authority of the commission conferred by paragraphs (18) to (21) * * * shall not extend to the construction * * * of spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one State.' 49 U.S.C.A.  1(22). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See 28 U.S.C.  41(28), 43, 44, 45, 45a, 47, 47a, 345 (28 U.S.C.A .  41(28), 4345, 45a, 47a, 345) Cf. section 380 (28 U.S.C.A.  380) \n\n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUGET SOUND STEVEDORING CO. v. TAX COM'N OF STATE OF WASHINGTON(1937)\nNo. 68\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ben C. Grosscup, Bernard H. Levinson, and John Ambler, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. E. P. Donnelly, of Seattle, Wash., for appellees. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 90, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A tax laid upon the business of a stevedoring company, the amount to be measured by a percentage of the gross receipts, has been sustained against the protest of the taxpayer that an unlawful burden is imposed thereby upon interstate and foreign commerce. We are to determine whether the tax is valid either altogether or in part.\n A statute of the state of Washington provides that for the privilege of engaging in business activities within the state a tax shall be payable by persons so engaged, payment to be made according to a designated measure. As to certain forms of business, as, for example, manufacturing and sales at retail or wholesale, the measure is a specially prescribed percentage of the value of the products or the gross receipts of sales. As to all other forms of business there is a general provision that the tax shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of one-half of one per cent. Washington Laws 1935, c. 180 (page 706). This general provision is broad enough to cover the business of a stevedore.\n Appellant, the Puget Sound Stevedoring Company, is a Washington corporation. It is engaged in the general stevedoring business at Seattle and at other ports on Puget Sound. At times it contracts with a shipowner or shipmaster to load or discharge a vessel through its own employees, controlling and directing the work itself. The great mass of its business, as we were informed upon the argument, is done in that way. At times, however, even though comparatively infrequently, it makes a different kind of contract which changes essentially its relation to the ship. In this second form of contract it does not undertake to control, direct, or supervise the work. It 'merely collects the longshoremen and supplies them to the vessel,' advancing their pay at the completion of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n job and 'billing the ship and her owner the amount of the pay-roll plus a commission for services.' All vessels served by the appellants are engaged exclusively in interstate or foreign commerce.\n A suit by the taxpayer to enjoin the tax officials of the state from proceeding to collect the tax was dismissed by the trial court after a hearing upon bill and answer; the answer not disputing the allegations of the bill. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed the dismissal; its judgment being placed upon the ground that the taxpayer was an independent contractor engaged in a local business. 189 Wash. 131, 63 P.(2d) 532. The case is here upon appeal. 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 U.S.C.A.  344).\n\n 1. \nThe business of appellant, in so far as it consists of the loading and discharge of cargoes by longshoremen subject to its own direction and control, is interstate or foreign commerce.\n Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put aboard the ship and taken off at destination. A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master. 'Formerly the work was done by the ship's crew; but, owing to the exigencies of increasing commerce and the demand for rapidity and special skill, it has become a specialized service devolving upon a class 'as clearly identified with maritime affairs as are the mariners.\" Atlantic Transport Co. of West Virginia v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 62\n, 34 S.Ct. 733, 735, 51 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1157. No one would deny that the crew would be engaged in interstate or foreign commerce if busied in loading or unloading an interestate or foreign vessel. Cf. Baltimore & O.S.W.R.R. Co. v. Burtch, \n263 \nU.S. 540\n, 44 S.Ct. 165. The longshoreman busied in the same task bears the same relation as the crew to the commerce that he serves. Indeed, for the purposes of the Merchant Marine Act (41 Stat. 988, 1007,  33 (46 U.S.C.A.  688)), a stevedore is a 'seaman.' International \n\n[302 \nU.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S.Ct. 19. A stipulation in the record tells us that any serious interruption in the service of such cargo handlers cripples at once the activities of a port and slows down and obstructs the free and steady flow of commerce. We might take judicial notice of the fact if the stipulation were not here.\n What was done by this appellant in the business of loading and unloading was not prolonged beyond the stage of transportation and its reasonable incidents. Cf. Baltimore & O.S.W.R.R. Co. v. Burtch, supra. True, the service did not begin or end at the ship's side, where the cargo is placed upon a sling attached to the ship's tackle. It took in the work of carriage to and from the 'first place of rest,' which means that it covered the space between the hold of the vessel and a convenient point of discharge upon the dock. Sometimes, though not, it seems, under appellant's contracts, the work in the hold is done by members of the crew, and the work upon the dock by employees of the dock company. Sometimes the cost is absorbed by the vessel and sometimes billed as an extra charge to shipper or consignee. The fact is stipulated, however, that no matter by whom the work is done or paid for, 'stevedoring services are essential to waterborne commerce and always commence in the hold of the vessel and end at the 'first place of rest,' and vice versa.' In such circumstances services beginning or ending in the hold or on the dock stand on the same plane for the purposes of this case as those of the ship's sling. The movement is continuous, is covered by a single contract, and is necessary in all its stages if transportation is to be accomplished without unreasonable impediments. The situation thus presented has no resemblance to that considered in People of New York ex rel. Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Knight, \n192 \nU.S. 21, 26\n, 24 S.Ct. 202, 203, where an interstate railroad furnished its passengers with taxicab service to and from its terminus, the service being 'contracted and paid for in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n dependently of any contract or payment for strictly interstate transportation.'\n The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the state of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts. Decisions to that effect are many and controlling. Philadelphia & Southern S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 341\n, 342 S., 7 S.Ct. 1118; Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380; Galveston H. & S.A. Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S.Ct. 638; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126; Matson Navigation Co. v. State Board of Equalization, \n297 \nU.S. 441, 444\n, 56 S.Ct. 553, 554; Fisher's Blend Station v. Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650, 655\n, 56 S.Ct. 608, 610. The fact is not important that appellant does business as an independent contractor as long as the business that it does is commerce immune from regulation by the states. What is decisive is the nature of the act, not the person of the actor. An independent contractor undertaking to navigate a vessel would have the same protection as a pilot agreeing to navigate it himself.\n\n 2. \nThe business of appellant, in so far as it consists of supplying longshoremen to shipowners or masters without directing or controlling the work of loading or unloading, is not interstate or foreign commerce, but rather a local business, and subject, like such business generally, to taxation by the state.\n What is done by appellant in connection with activities of this order is similar in many aspects to the work of a ship's chandler, and even more closely similar to that of a labor or employment bureau. Such a bureau was considered in Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 278\n, 21 S.Ct. 128, and its business found to be no part of interstate or foreign commerce, though the transactions of such commerce were increased thereby. Cf. Federal Compress Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17, 21\n, 22 S., 54 S.Ct. 267, 268, 269; Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 584\n, 54 S.Ct. 541. Little analogy exists between the activities now \n\n[302 \nU.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n in question and those reviewed in McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S.

The contractors there considered were found to be acting as agents of foreign steamship companies with authority to make contracts binding on the principals and even running in their names. If appellant stands in that relation to the vessels that it serves in this branch of its activities, it has failed to make the fact apparent by the allegations of its bill. The effect of such a showing is not before us now.\n The decree of the Supreme Court of Washington, being erroneous to the extent here indicated and no farther, is modified accordingly, the cause being remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.

His timely appeal was taken on June 30, 1936. Within thirty days thereafter the trial judge extended the time to file a bill of exceptions to and including November 1, 1936, which was a Sunday. The trial had been long and the testimony was voluminous. On October 20, 1936, after unsuccessful efforts to obtain an agreement as to the condensation of the evidence, petitioner applied to the trial judge for an extension of time to settle and file the bill of exceptions. As it was found that the trial judge was without authority to grant that extension, petitioner sought an extension \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n from the Circuit Court of Appeals, but his motion was denied on October 27th. He then asked the trial judge to settle the stenographer's minutes as the bill of exceptions. That motion was first denied on October 29th, but on the following day the trial judge expressed his willingness to receive a similar application if the colloquy of counsel was stricken from the transcript, that application to be made on Monday, November 2d. On that day the bill of exceptions, so prepared, was settled and filed. On November 16, 1936, the government moved to docket and dismiss the appeal upon the ground that petitioner had failed to comply with rules 8 and 9 of the Criminal Appeals Rules (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). The motion was granted. Petitioner asked for a rehearing and was heard. Insisting that it was impossible within the allotted time to set forth the evidence in condensed and narrative form, petitioner requested the Circuit Court of Appeals to exercise its discretionary power under rule 9 to the end that the defect in the bill of exceptions might be cured. That request was made simultaneously with the motion to dismiss. It appears to have been treated as a motion to amend the record and it was denied. The court took the view that as, by the assignment of errors filed with the bill of exceptions, the question was raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction, it was necessary under the rule that the evidence should be properly presented in condensed and narrative form. The court held that the time for the settlement of the bill of exceptions could not be enlarged, and that if the bill were returned to the trial judge he would be powerless to correct, amend or resettle it as the time for such action had expired.\n Finally the court decided that petitioner was inexcusably delinquent. The court said: 'This appellant had four months v. United States (C.C.A. 8th) 84 F. (2d) delinquency. The bill of exceptions was insufficient.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n The motion to amend the record was denied and the motion to dismiss the appeal was granted. 86 F.(2d) 942, 944.\n First.-The government contends United States (C.C.A.9th) 86 F(2d) 463; 2d was too late. The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly held the contrary. The trial judge, by valid order, had extended the time 'to and including the 1st day of November, 1936.' That day being Sunday, on which the bill of exceptions could not be filed, the trial judge construed his order as permitting the settlement and filing on the following day. Rule 13 of the Criminal Appeals Rules (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a) provides:\n'For the purpose of computing time as specified in the foregoing rules, Sundays and legal holidays (whether under Federal law or under the law of the State where the case was brought) shall be excluded.'\n\n The government argues that this rule refers to a 'computation,' as where the extension is for a certain term or period, and not to a case where a specific date is fixed. The latter case is said to lie outside the rule and we are referred to various decisions which are deemed to furnish analogies for our guidance in reaching a conclusion upon a point left open. But there appears to be no reason why rule 13 should be so narrowly construed. The phrase 'For the purpose of computing time' was plainly intended to be of general application and 'computing' naturally embraces whatever reckoning is necessary to fix the time allowed. When a specific date is fixed and that date falls on Sunday or a holiday, the rule for the reckoning requires that that day be excluded and hence the bill of exceptions, in this case, apart from other questions, was settled and filed in time.\n Second.-The Circuit Court of Appeals had authority to extend the time for filing the bill of exceptions. Rule 9 does limit the power of the trial judge to grant extensions. The purpose of the rule being to expedite appeals in criminal cases, it was sought to put an end to the inor- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n dinate delays due to extensions of time to prepare bills of exceptions. Such extensions had been one of the most prolific causes of the delays in the disposition of criminal appeals. Accordingly rule 9 provides:\n'In cases other than those described in Rule VIII (which refers to the record on appeal without bill of exceptions), the appellant, within thirty (30) days after the taking of the appeal, or within such further time as within said period of thirty days may be fixed by the trial judge, shall procure to be settled, and shall file with the clerk of the court in which the case was tried, a bill of exceptions setting forth the proceedings upon which the appellant wishes to rely in addition to those shown by the clerk's record as described in Rule VIII.'\n\n The rule presupposes that the trial judge, who is familiar with the proceedings on the trial, is in a position to estimate the length of time that is necessary for the preparation and filing of the bill of exceptions, and he is permitted within thirty days after the taking of the appeal to fix that time. That is the limit of his authority,1 save as he may act under the direction of the Circuit Court of Appeals. But, while this limit is placed upon \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n the power of the trial judge, the Criminal Appeals Rules give full authority to the Circuit Court of Appeals to set aside or modify his order whenever it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion or that the interests of justice require it.\n The fundamental policy of the Criminal Appeals Rules is that as speedily as possible, upon the taking of the appeal; the Circuit Court of Appeals shall be invested with jurisdiction to see that the appeal is properly expedited and to supervise and control all proceedings on the appeal 'including the proceedings relating to the preparation of the record on appeal.' Rule 4 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). For this purpose the rules provide that the notice of the appeal shall be filed in duplicate with the clerk of the trial court and a copy of the notice shall be served upon the United States attorney. Rule 3 (28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a). By rule 4 it becomes the duty of the clerk of the trial court immediately to forward the duplicate notice of appeal to the clerk of the appellate court, together with a statement from the docket entries in the case substantially as provided in the form annexed to the Rules. This is a ministerial duty which the clerk of the trial court must perform. With respect to the authority of the Circuit Court of Appeals, rule 4 provides:\n'From the time of the filing with its clerk of the duplicate notice of appeal, the appellate court shall, subject to these rules, have supervision and control of the proceedings on the appeal, including the proceedings relating to the preparation of the record on appeal.\n\n'The appellate court may at any time, upon five (5) days' notice, entertain a motion to dismiss the appeal, or for directions to the trial court, or to vacate or modify any order made by the trial court or by any judge in relation to the prosecution of the appeal, including any order for the granting of bail.'\n\n These provisions are comprehensive. The clause that the appellate court's supervision and control shall be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'subject to these rules' refers to the rules governing the action of the appellate court. To make effective this supervision and control, any matter requiring correction may be brought before the appellate court upon the short notice of five days. Thus there may be not only a motion to dismiss the appeal but 'for directions to the trial court' and 'to vacate or modify any order made by the trial court or by any judge in relation to the prosecution of the appeal.' As the supervision and control of the proceedings on the appeal expressly embraces the proceedings 'relating to the preparation of the record on appeal,' it cannot be said that an order made by the trial judge fixing the time for the settlement and filing of a bill of exceptions is excluded. It is, of course, assumed that the Circuit Court of Appeals will not lightly interfere with the action of the trial judge. But the rules appropriately provide for the correction of any miscarriage of justice in this respect, and the lodging of the supervision and control with the appellate court gives the highest assurance that on the one hand the action of the trial judge will not be interfered with unnecessarily and on the other that neither party will be remediless when corrective action is required. For example, it may clearly appear on a showing by the government that the time allowed by the trial judge for the filing of a bill of exceptions is altogether too long and that, in the interests of a reasonably prompt disposition of the appeal, it should be shortened; or it may clearly appear that the time allowed is unreasonably short and that justice requires that an extension should be granted. To give a desirable flexibility, the rules do not attempt to lay down specific requirements to meet various situations but place upon the Circuit Court of Appeals full responsibility for the exercise of a reasonable control over all proceedings pertaining to the appeal and all the orders of the trial court or judge in that relation.\n Third. The Circuit Court of Appeals had authority to \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n return the bill of exceptions to the trial judge and to require such correction as might be found to be appropriate, including the setting forth of the evidence in condensed and narrative form. Rule 9 provides:\n'Bills of exceptions shall conform to the provisions of Rule 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n'Upon the filing of the bill of exceptions and assignment of errors, the clerk of the trial court shall forthwith transmit them, together with such matters of record as are pertinent to the appeal, with his certificate, to the clerk of the appellate court, and the papers so forwarded shall constitute the record on appeal.\n\n'The appellate court may at any time, on five (5) days' notice, entertain a motion by either party for the correction, amplification, or reduction of the record filed with the appellate court and may issue such directions to the trial court, or trial judge, in relation thereto, as may be appropriate.'\n\n The authority of the Circuit Court of Appeals thus extends to the 'correction, amplification, or reduction' of the record on appeal of which the bill of exceptions is a part. The appellate court is authorized to require a proper bill of exceptions and to give any directions to the trial court or trial judge that may be necessary to attain that end.\n Rule 8 of the rules of this court (28 U.S.C.A. following section 354), to which rule 9 refers, provides (rule 8, par. 2):\n'Only so much of the evidence shall be embraced in a bill of exceptions as may be necessary to present clearly the questions of law involved in the rulings to which exceptions are reserved, and such evidence as is embraced therein shall be set forth in condensed and narrative form, save as a proper understanding of the questions presented may require that parts of it be set forth otherwise.' See Equity Rule 75(b ), 226 U.S. Appendix, p. 23, as amended, \n286 \nU.S. 570\n, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 166]\n\u00a0\n Under Equity Rule 75(b) we have held that the Circuit Court of Appeals is authorized, when a bill of exceptions is presented to it showing that the requirement for condensation or narration has been transgressed, to remit the transcript to the District Court so that a further opportunity may be had to comply with the Equity Rule. We also said that, in such a remission, care should be taken to require that the proceedings under the rule be conducted with reasonable dispatch. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Standard A. & R. Co., \n275 \nU.S. 372, 387\n, 48 S.Ct. 183, 188. In that case this court concluded that the Circuit Court of Appeals had passed the bounds of sound discretion in affirming the decree appealed from, because of the violation of the Equity Rule, and upon proper terms, should have remitted the transcript to the District Court for appropriate revision. Nothing in the Criminal Appeals Rules, in incorporating the requirement of Rule 8 of the Rules of this Court, deprives the Circuit Court of Appeals of like authority in dealing with bills of exceptions in criminal cases. On the contrary, rule 9 gives to the Circuit Court of Appeals that authority. The ruling in the instant case that the trial judge could 'no longer act to put the evidence in narrative form' and that the appellate court had 'no power to order him to do so' is erroneous. The trial judge could act under the direction of the appellate court and that court could give whatever direction the case required in order to give effect to the rule as to the proper preparation of the bill of exceptions.\n\n Fourth.-The supervision and control of the Circuit Court of Appeals under the Criminal Appeals Rules calls for the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, and its action will not be reviewed unless it appears that its discretion has been abused. In the instant case, despite the mistaken view of its authority, the court appears to have rested its final conclusion upon the ground that, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 158, 167]\n\u00a0\n even if the court had the power to grant petitioner's request, the circumstances justified its denial. The court pointed to the fact that petitioner had four months to procure the settlement of the bill of exceptions and the court thought his excuses insufficient. While petitioner strongly insists upon the authority of the appellate court, he apparently took no steps to have that authority exercised in his favor until toward the end of October. He complains that at that time, upon his motion for an extension of time or other relief, the court itself suggested that an application should be made to the trial judge for an order settling the stenographer's minutes as the bill of exceptions, and that the circuit judges intimated to the government's counsel that opposition to that course should be withdrawn. This, it is said, took place on October 27th. Petitioner urges that in directing the settlement of the bill of exceptions in its inappropriate form he was but following the suggestion of the appellate court in view of his exigency and with the idea that the condensation and narration of the evidence could later be obtained. But the Circuit Court of Appeals was fully acquainted with all that had taken place. When the later motions came before the court, it was clearly entitled to review the whole matter and reach a conclusion as to the proper exercise of its discretion. It was the province of the court to weigh the petitioner's excuses. It did so and found them to be without merit. In the light of its statement as to the ultimate ground of its action we cannot say that the court failed to exercise its discretion or that its action was an abuse of discretion. In that view the order is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See White v. United States (C.C.A.4th) 80 F.(2d) 515, 516; Yep v. United States (C.C.A.10th) 81 F.(2d) 637; United States v.

Co.   \n300 \nU.S. 124\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n  Messrs. Kester Walton and John Y. Jordan, Jr., both of Asheville, N.C ., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 126]\n\u00a0\n  Mr. S. G. Bernard, of Asheville, N.C., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina1 sustaining the validity of a statute claimed to impair the obligation of a contract, contrary to article 1, section 10, of the Federal Constitution. The act provides that when the mortgagee, payee, or other holder of an obligation secured by real estate or personal property causes a sale of the property by a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 127]\n\u00a0\n trustee, becomes the purchaser for a sum less than the amount of the debt and afterwards brings an action for the deficiency, the defendant may show, by way of defense and set-off, that the property sold was fairly worth the amount of the debt or that the sum bid was substantially less than the true value of the property, and thus defeat the claim in whole or in part. The provision is copied in full in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n  In 1928 the appellees borrowed $8,000 from the appellant for which they executed negotiable promissory notes. As security they delivered a deed of trust pledging real estate. Upon default the appellant demanded that the trustee declare the indebtedness due, in accordance with the terms of the notes and deed of trust, and exercise the power of sale given by the deed. The trus- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 128]\n\u00a0\n tee advertised the property as required by the deed and the laws of the state, and made sale June 19, 1933; and one acting in appellant's interest purchased the land for $3,000. Upon expiration of a ten-day period of redemption the property was conveyed to the purchaser. The appellant credited on the notes the sum realized by the sale which left $4,534.79, with interest, due and unpaid, and on June 18, 1934, brought action to recover this balance. The appellees pleaded the statute and alleged that the property, at the time and place of sale, was fairly worth the amount of the debt. In reply the appellant asserted that, as the notes and deed of trust had been executed prior to the passage of the law, the statute violated the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. At the trial exception was taken to the court's refusal to enter judgment for the appellant on the pleadings. The court, over the appellant's objection and exception, submitted to the jury the question of the fair value of the property at the time and place of sale, and the jury found its value to be $ 8,000. An intermediate appellate court, and the Supreme Court of the state, affirmed judgment for the appellees.\n  Although admitting that the challenged legislation affects only a remedy for enforcement of the contract, the appellant urges that the alteration is so substantial as to impair the obligation of the contract. The applicable principle is not in dispute. The Legislature may modify, limit, or alter the remedy for enforcement of a contract without impairing its obligation, but in so doing, it may not deny all remedy or so circumscribe the existing remedy with conditions and restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right. 3 The particular remedy existing at the date of the contract may be altogether abrogated if another equally effective for the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 129]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of the obligation remains or is substituted for the one taken away. \n4\n The matter in dispute is whether the questioned enactment falls beyond the boundary of permissible regulation of the remedy for enforcement of the appellant's contract.\n  The loan rendered the appellees debtors to the appellant. For that debt the borrower pledged real estate as security. The contract contemplated that the lender should make itself whole, if necessary, out of the security, but not that it should be enriched at the expense of the borrower or realize more than would repay the loan with interest. The state provided remedies whereby the security could be made available for solution of the debt.\n  When the loan was made, two such remedies were available. The mortgagee could proceed by bill in equity to foreclose the security. If it did, the chancellor who controlled the proceeding could set aside a sale if the price bid was inadequate. In addition, he might award a money decree for the amount by which the avails of the sale fell below the amount of the indebtedness, but his decree in that behalf would be governed by well-understood principles of equity. An alternative remedy sanctioned by state law was available if the deed of trust so provided. This was the sale of the pledged property by the trustee. If this were the remedy authorized by the contract, and the mortgagee himself became the purchaser at the trustee's sale, he might thereafter, in an action at law, recover the difference between the price he had bid and the amount of the indebtedness. The statute under attack effected certain alterations of this remedy. Sections 1 and 2, not here in issue, provide that if the mortgaged property be sold under power of sale, and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 130]\n\u00a0\n the sum bid be inadequate so that consummation of the sale would be inequitable, the mortgagor may apply to the superior court for an order enjoining such consummation, and the judge may direct a resale by a trustee or by a commissioner appointed for the purpose, upon terms he may deem just and equitable. These sections modifying the procedure under a power of sale so as to assimilate it to the procedure in strict foreclosure, have been sustained as constitutional by the state Supreme Court. \n5\n The section with which we are concerned adds that if the mortgagee becomes the purchaser at the trustee's sale, and afterwards brings an action at law for a deficiency, the jury shall determine the actual amount needed by him to make him whole for his debt by finding the true or fair value of the property at the date of sale, the judgment being for the difference between that value and the amount of the debt remaining unpaid, or, if the value found equals the amount of the debt, for the defendant. The statute has no application if the purchaser at the trustee's sale be other than the mortgagee. The act alters and modifies one of the existing remedies for realization of the value of the security, but cannot fairly be said to do more than restrict the mortgagee to that for which he contracted, namely, payment in full. It recognizes the obligation of his contract and his right to its full enforcement but limits that right so as to prevent his obtaining more than his due. By the old and well-known remedy of foreclosure a mortgagee was so limited because of the chancellor's control of the proceeding. That proceeding, as has been said, has always been available to the mortgagee in North Carolina. Granting that by the alternative remedy of trustee's sale the mortgagee \n\n[300 \nU.S. 124\n, 131]\n\u00a0\n might perchance obtain something more, or might obtain only that which was his due somewhat more expeditiously, than he could in chancery, it remains that the procedure to foreclose in equity is, and has been, the classical method of realization upon mortgage security and has always been understood to be fair to both parties to the contract and to afford an adequate remedy to the mortgagee. If, therefore, the Legislature of the state had elected altogether to abolish the remedy by trustee's sale, we could not say that it had not left the mortgagee an adequate remedy for the enforcement of his contract. But the Legislature has by no means gone so far. The law has merely restricted the exercise of the contractual remedy to provide a procedure which, to some extent, renders the remedy by a trustee's sale consistent with that in equity. This does not impair the obligation of the contract.\n  The judgment is affirmed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 210 N.C. 29, 185 S.E. 482. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3 of chapter 275, of the Public Laws of 1933:\n'When any sale of real estate or personal property has been made by a mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to make the same, at which the mortgagee, payee or other holder of the obligation thereby secured becomes the purchaser and takes title either directly or indirectly, and thereafter such mortgagee, payee or other holder of the secured obligation, as aforesaid, shall sue for and undertake to recover a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor, trustor or other maker of any such obligation whose property has been so purchased, it shall be competent and lawful for the defendant against whom such deficiency judgment is sought to allege and show as matter of defense and off-set, but not by way of counterclaim, that the property sold was fairly worth the amount of the debt secured by it at the time and place of sale or that the amount bid was substantially less than its true value, and, upon such showing, to defeat or off-set any deficiency judgment against him, either in whole or in part; Provided, this section shall not affect nor apply to the rights of other purchasers or of innocent third parties, nor shall it be held to affect or defeat the negotiability of any note, bond or other obligation secured by such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument; Provided, further, this section shall not apply to foreclosure sales made pursuant to an order or decree of court nor to any judgment sought or rendered in any foreclosure suit nor to any sale heretofore made and confirmed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Worthen Co. ex rel.

Bernays and Miss Susan Brandeis, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. D. Whitney, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The provability of certain landlords' claims in proceedings under section 77B of the bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A.  207) is here drawn in question. The petitioners were lessors of the debtor. Their leases were rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding pending when the reorganization section was adopted. All of the leases contained indemnity covenants similar to that considered in Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 445\n, 57 S.Ct. 298. The variant in the present case is the contention that prior to initiation of the 77B proceeding, the petitioners bargained away any valid claims they had against the debtor and its assets. \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n In August, 1932, when United Cigar Stores Company was adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt, there were in force about one thousand leases under which it held real estate. In some cases the trustee desired to retain the demised premises under a new lease for a shorter term, or at a lower rental, or both. In others where the company occupied and used but a part of the premises and sublet the balance, the trustee desired the abrogation of the lease as to that portion which United had sublet, and a new lease covering only the portion used by United. In certain instances where the company was lessee and sole occupant, or occupied a part and sublet a part, or had sublet the entire premises, the trustee wished to be rid of the leasehold.\n In order to deal with these varying situations the trustee presented appropriate forms of agreement to landlords, many of whom executed them. Ninety-four landlords who had re-entered the demised premises, pursuant to such agreements, during the pendency of the original bankruptcy, filed claims in the reorganization proceeding. From the District Court's disallowance of the claims all the claimants joined in a single appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found that each of eighty-two claimants, in connection with the transfer of possession of the premises, or the modification of the existing leases, gave a general, unqualified release to the trustee, individually and as trustee, to the bankrupt and to the bankrupt estate, of all claims under the leases or in respect of rent. Three, so the court found, gave releases containing reservations which were not broad enough to preserve claims provable under section 77B.\n The court held that the releases executed by these eighty-five landlords were not procured by duress or misrepresentation, were for a valid consideration, and extinguished all claims the releasors might have had. As \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n respects the remaining nine claims, the court divided, a majority holding the agreements the landlords executed, and what was done pursuant to the agreements, amounted to a surrender under state law and therefore deprived the claimants of the right to prove, and one judge holding that whether or not surrenders had occurred under state law the form of the agreements reserved claims against the debtor's assets in the reorganization proceeding. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n All ninety-four claimants petitioned this court for review by certiorari. We granted the writ to the nine last mentioned.\n In each of the cases under consideration surrender and repossession of the premises was pursuant to an agreement between the claimant, as lessor, the respondent, as trustee, and the United Company. After describing the lease, reciting the state of the title thereunder, the bankruptcy proceeding, and the authority granted the trustee by the court to reject the lease, the contract contains these provisions: The trustee assigns to the lessor its right, title, and interest in and to the lease and any subleases; the bankrupt does the same, and also assigns its right to any rent accrued and to accrue under subleases; the trustee agrees to pay to the landlord any rents received from subtenants by it as receiver or trustee, less certain costs; the landlord assumes all existing and future obligations, terms, and conditions of and under the lease and any sublease which would be performable by the bankrupt or the trustee. By article fifth the landlord releases the trustee (individually and as receiver and trustee), the bankrupt estate, and the bankrupt from any and all liability of any nature with respect to the lease and the subleases and with respect to the premises, including all claims of the landlord in respect of rent or use \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n or occupation. To each agreement a rider prepared by the trustee was attached at the insistence of the landlord. In most of the cases the rider was substantially in the following form: 'Nothing in this Article 5 shall be deemed a waiver by the Landlord of the right to prove against the Bankrupt Estate any provable claims to which the Bankruptcy Court may adjudge the Landlord is entitled, but this shall not be deemed to render any claim a provable claim which is not otherwise such or to relieve the Landlord from the necessity of proving and obtaining the allowance of any such claim or preclude the Trustee from contesting such proof or allowance.'\n In one the form was: 'It is, however, expressly understood and agreed that the said Landlord does not waive any right to prove against the Bankrupt Estate any provable claims to which the Bankruptcy Court may adjudge the Landlord is entitled, but this shall not be deemed to render any claim a provable claim which is not otherwise such or relieve the Landlord from the necessity of proving and obtaining the allowance of any such claim or preclude the Trustee from contesting such proof or allowance. All such provable claims shall not be affected by this agreement.'\n The special master to whom the matter was referred conceded that the riders were intended to preserve claims for future rent, but thought them effective to save only claims the provability of which resulted from a favorable court ruling and that claims rendered provable by subsequent legislation were not within the reservation. The District Court approved the master's report. A majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals held the agreements constituted surrenders, which, according to state law, terminated all rights of the landlords against the tenant, and no claim is provable under section 77B, unless it is a continuing and subsisting claim against the debtor, recognized by \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 461]\n\u00a0\n the substantive law of landlord and tenant, that is, by the applicable state law. The riders were construed to be qualifications of the Fifth article only, which was the general release. As there was, in this view of the agreements, no right or claim to be released, a reservation or restriction applicable only to the release amounted to nothing. The dissenting judge agreed that the contracts operated as surrenders but held that the riders were not limited in their operation to the release clause alone but were applicable to the entire contract and were intended and effective to reserve claims which might be found to be provable, despite surrender, either as the result of future judicial decision or future legislative action.\n\n 1. \nWe refused to grant certiorari in the case of the eighty-five claimants each of whom, for a consideration, bargained away all claims, present or prospective, against the bankrupt, the trustee and the estate. We agree with the court below that, under well settled principles, their releases preclude proof of claims for future rent or for indemnity.\n\n 2. \nWe have held in City Bank Farmers Trust Company v. Irving Trust Company, \n299 \nU.S. 433\n, 57 S.Ct. 292, decided this day that surrender by the trustee, acceptance by the landlord, reentry, and the exercise of dominion over the demised premises by the latter after rejection of the lease, do not deprive him of a provable claim in proceedings under section 77B for injury due to rejection of his lease or upon the covenant of indemnity found in the lease. It follows that, except for the release, which was a part of each of the agreements, the petitioners would have provable claims.\n\n 3. \nWe do not agree, therefore, that if the earlier paragraphs of the agreements worked a surrender (which we do not decide) nothing was left upon which the final release clause could operate. An absolute release would have been a bar to claims for future rent or for indemnity. \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 462]\n\u00a0\n 4. As we have seen, each of the releases was qualified by a rider which reserved 'the right to prove against the Bankrupt estate any provable claims to which the Bankruptcy Court may adjudge the landlord is entitled.' A majority of the court below thought that these riders applied only to the release clause. The dissenting judge thought that they purported to reserve all claims provable as a result of judicial decision or amendment of the statute which might otherwise be lost by the execution and performance of the agreements and that they were effective for that purpose notwithstanding the earlier paragraphs of the agreement amounted to a surrender under state law. We think this is the correct view of the meaning and effect of the reservations. The language in which they are couched is broad enough to include claims under section 77B. They reserve the right to prove against the bankrupt estate any provable claims to which the bankruptcy court may adjudge the landlord is entitled. The bankrupt estate, to which the reservations refer, consists of the property which formerly belonged to the bankrupt and, upon adjudication, came into the custody of the bankruptcy court. It still remains there. Claims for future rent are specifically made provable by section 77B(b)(10), 11 U.S.C. A.  207(b), (10). The court having charge of the reorganization proceeding is a bankruptcy court. Section 77A (11 U.S.C.A.  206) provides: 'In addition to the jurisdiction exercised in voluntary and involuntary proceedings to adjudge persons bankrupt, courts of bankruptcy shall exercise original jurisdiction in proceedings for the relief of debtors, as provided in Section 77B of this Act (section 207 of this chapter).' Proceedings in reorganization under section 77B (11 U.S.C.A.  207) are 'proceedings in bankruptcy.' \n2\n They may be initiated in a pending bankruptcy proceeding by the express terms of subsection (p). The petitioners are creditors and their claims are provable by the express terms of the section; the estate against which the peti- \n\n[299 U.S. 456, 463]\n\u00a0\n tioners reserved all provable claims is the same estate which was within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court at the time the agreements were executed.\n The special master found, and it seems to be conceded, that the reservations were intended to preserve claims for future rent or for indemnity for loss of future rent. But the master held, and the majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, that their scope was restricted to claims provable as a result of judicial decision and did not extend to claims made provable by legislation. The language used does not so limit them. The most that can be said is that there was serious question whether such claims could be proved under the law as it stood when the agreements were executed. For whatever they were worth the petitioners desired the reservations so that they might possibly make good claims for injury done and loss incurred by the abrogation of their leases. If amendatory legislation was adopted the bankruptcy court might, pursuant thereto, adjudge them entitled to allowance of a claim. We think the operation of the saving clause cannot be limited by the fact that the claims are described as those to which the bankruptcy court may adjudge the petitioners entitled. That court's adjudication would necessarily follow and apply any amendment of the Act. We hold, therefore, that the reservation was broad enough to preserve the right to prove whatever claims were provable and allowable either by judicial decision or supplementary legislation. It follows that the petitioners' claims are provable.\n The decree below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In re United Cigar Stores of America (Joseph E.

Lamfrom, of Milwaukee, Wis., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 471]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph A. Padway, of Milwaukee, Wis., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether the provisions of the Wisconsin Labor Code which authorize giving publicity to labor disputes, declare peaceful picketing and patrolling lawful and prohibit granting of an injunction against such conduct, violate, as here construed and applied, the due process clause or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Labor Code occupies sections 103.51 to 103.63 of the Wisconsin Statutes, 1935 (Wis. Laws, 1931, c. 376; Laws, 1935, c. 551,  5). But only the following provisions of section 103.53 are directly involved on this appeal:\n'(1) The following acts, whether performed singly or in concert, shall be legal: ...\n\n'(e) Giving publicity to and obtaining or communicating information regarding the existence of, or the facts involved in, any dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling any public street or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be, without intimidation or coercion, or by any other method not involving fraud, violence, breach of the peace, or threat thereof. ...\n\n'(l) Peaceful picketing or patrolling, whether engaged in singly or in numbers, shall be legal.1\n\n'(2) No court, nor any judge or judges thereof, shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction which, in specific or general terms, prohibits any person or persons from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of the foregoing acts.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 473]\n\u00a0\n On December 28, 1935, Senn brought this suit in the circuit court of Milwaukee county, against Tile Layers Protective Union, Local No. 5, Tile Layers Helpers Union, Local No. 47, and their business agents, seeking an injunction to restrain picketing, and particularly 'publishing, stating or proclaiming that the plaintiff is unfair to organized labor or to the defendant unions'; and also to restrain some other acts which have since been discontinued, and are not now material. The defendants answered; and the case was heard upon extensive evidence. The trial court found the following facts:\n\n The journeymen tile layers at Milwaukee were, to a large extent, members of Tile Layers Protective Union, Local No. 5, and the helpers, members of Tile Layers Helpers Union, Local No. 47. Senn was engaged at Milwaukee in the tile contracting business under the name of 'Paul Senn & Co., Tile Contracting.' His business was a small one, conducted, in the from his residence, with a showroom elsewhere. He employed one or two journeymen tile layers and one or two helpers, depending upon the amount of work he had contracted to do at the time. But, working with his own hands with tools of the trade, he performed personally on the jobs much work of a character commonly done by a tile layer or a helper. Neither Senn, nor any of his employees, was at the time this suit was begun a member of either union, and neither had any contractual relations with them. Indeed, Senn could not become a member of the tile layers union, since its constitution and rules require, among other things, that a journeyman tile setter shall have acquired his practical experience through an apprenticeship of not less than three years, and Senn had not served such an apprenticeship.\n For some years the tile laying industry had been in a demoralized state because of lack of building operations; and members of the union had been in competition with \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 474]\n\u00a0\n nonunion tile layers and helpers in their effort to secure work. The tile contractors by whom members of the unions were employed had entered into collective bargaining agreements with the unions governing wages, hours, and working conditions. The wages paid by the union contractors had for some time been higher than those paid by Senn to his employees.\n Because of the peculiar composition of the industry, which consists of employers with small numbers of employees, the unions had found it necessary for the protection of the individual rights of their members in the prosecution of their trade to require all employers agreeing to conduct a union shop to assent to the following provision:\n'Article III. It is definitely understood that no individual, member of a partnership or corporation engaged in the Tile Contracting Business shall work with the tools or act as Helper but that the installation of all materials claimed by the party of the second part as listed under the caption 'Classification of Work' in this agreement, shall be done by journeymen members of Tile Layers Protection Union Local #5.'\n\n The unions endeavored to induce Senn to become a union contractor; and requested him to execute an agreement in form substantially identical with that entered into by the Milwaukee contractors who employ union men. Senn expressed a willingness to execute the agreement provided article III was eliminated. The union declared that this was impossible; that the inclusion of the provision was essential to the unions' interests in maintaining wage standards and spreading work among their members; and, moreover, that to eliminate article III from the contract with Senn would discriminate against existing union contractors, all of whom had signed agreements containing the article. As the unions declared its elimination impossible, Senn refused to sign \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 475]\n\u00a0\n the agreement and unionize his shop. Because of his refusal, the unions picketed his place of business. The picketing was peaceful, without violence, and without any unlawful act. The evidence was that the pickets carried one banner with the inscription 'P. Senn Tile Company is unfair to the Tile Layers Protective Union,' another with the inscription 'Let the Union tile layer install your tile work.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The trial court denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. On the findings made, it ruled that the controversy was 'a labor dispute' within the meaning of section 103.62; that the picketing, done solely in furtherance of the dispute, was 'lawful' under section 103.53; that it was not unlawful for the defendants 'to advise, notify or persuade, without fraud, violence or threat thereof, any person or persons, of the existence of said labor dispute; ...\n'That the agreement submitted by the defendants to the plaintiff, setting forth terms and conditions prevailing in that portion of the industry which is unionized, is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 476]\n\u00a0\n sought by the defendants for the purpose of promoting their welfare and enhancing their own interests in their trade and craft as workers in the industry.\n\n'That Article III of said agreement is a reasonable and lawful rule adopted by the defendants out of the necessities of employment within the industry and for the protection of themselves as workers and craftsmen in the industry.'\n\n Senn appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court and denied a motion for rehearing, two judges dissenting. 222 Wis. 383, 268 N.W. 270, 274, 872. The case is here on appeal.\n First. The defendants moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. They contend that the federal question presented is not substantial. And friends of the court suggest that the appeal should be dismissed because the decision below was based upon nonfederal grounds, or that there was an alternative, independent nonfederal ground broad enough to sustain the judgment; that the challenge here is not to a statute, but to a judicial decision based upon principles of general law which have been approved by some judges and disapproved by others;3 and that there is nothing to show that the provisions of the Wisconsin Labor Code here questioned are not merely declaratory of the common law of Wisconsin as it existed prior to the statute. But it sufficiently appears that the provisions of the Labor Code were relied upon; that their validity under the Fourteenth Amendment was duly challenged below; and that the rulings by the state courts were based ultimately on the Labor Code. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 477]\n\u00a0\n Whether the statute as construed and applied violates the Fourteenth Amendment presents issues never expressly passed upon by this Court. We deny the motion to dismiss.\n Second. The hearings below were concerned mainly with questions of state law. Senn insisted there that the statute was no defense, because the controversy was not a 'labor dispute' within the meaning of section 103.62. 4 The courts ruled that the controversy was a 'labor dispute'; and that the acts done by the defendant were among those declared 'lawful' by section 103.53. See, also, American Furniture Co. v. I.B., etc., Chauffeurs, etc., General Local No. 200, 222 Wis. 338, 268 N.W. 250, 106 A. L.R. 335. Those issues involved the construction and application of the statute and the Constitution of the state. As to them, the judgment of its highest court is conclusive. The question for our decision is whether the statute, as applied to the facts found, took Senn's liberty or property or denied him equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Senn does not claim broadly that the Federal Constitution prohibits a state from authorizing publicity and peaceful picketing. His claim of invalidity is rested on the fact that he refused to unionize his shop solely because the union insisted upon the retention of article III. He contends that the right to work in his business with his own hands is a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and that the state may not authorize unions \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 478]\n\u00a0\n to employ publicity and picketing to induce him to refrain from exercising it.\n The unions concede that Senn, so long as he conducts a nonunion shop, has the right to work with his hands and tools. He may do so, as freely as he may work his employees longer hours and at lower wages than the union rules permit. He may bid for contracts at a low figure based upon low wages and long hours. But the unions contend that, since Senn's exercise of the right to do so is harmful to the interests of their members, they may seek by legal means to induce him to agree to unionize his shop and to refrain from exercising his right to work with his own hands. The judgment of the highest court of the state establishes that both the means employed and the end sought by the unions are legal under its law. The question for our determination is whether either the means or the end sought is forbidden by the Federal Constitution.\n Third. Clearly the means which the statute authorizes-picketing and publicity-are not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. Members of a union might, without special statutory authorization by a state, make known the facts of a labor dispute, for freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The state may, in the exercise of its police power, regulate the methods and means of publicity as well as the use of public streets. If the end sought by the unions is not forbidden by the Federal Constitution, the state may authorize working men to seek to attain it by combining as pickets, just as it permits capitalists and employers to combine in other ways to attain their desired economic ends. The Legislature of Wisconsin has declared that 'peaceful picketing and patrolling' on the public streets and places shall be permissible 'whether engaged in singly or in numbers' provided this is done 'without intimidation or coercion' and free from 'fraud, violence, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 479]\n\u00a0\n breach of the peace, or threat thereof.' The statute provides that the picketing must be peaceful; and that term as used implies not only absence of violence, but absence of any unlawful act. It precludes the intimidation of customers. It precludes any form of physical obstruction or interference with the plaintiff's business. It authorizes giving publicity to the existence of the dispute 'whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling any public street or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be'; but precludes misrepresentation of the facts of the controversy. And it declares that 'nothing herein shall be construed to legalize a secondary boycott.' See Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 466\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 176, 16 A.L.R. 196. Inherently, the means authorized are clearly unobjectionable. In declaring such picketing permissible, Wisconsin has put this means of publicity on a par with advertisements in the press.\n The state courts found that the unions observed the limitations prescribed by the statute. The conduct complained of is patrol with banners by two or four pickets. Compare American Steel Foundries v. Tri- City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 207\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 77, 27 A.L.R. 360. The picketing was peaceful. The publicity did not involve a misrepresentation of fact; nor was any claim made below that relevant facts were suppressed. Senn did not contend that it was untruthful to characterize him as 'unfair,' if the requirement that he refrain from working with his own hands was a lawful one. He did not ask that the banners be required to carry a fuller statement of the facts. Compare American Furniture Co. v. I.B., etc., Chauffeurs, etc., General Local No. 200, 222 Wis. 338, 340, 347, 268 N.W. 250, 251, 255, 106 A.L.R. 335. Moreover, it was confessedly open to Senn to disclose the facts in such manner and in such detail as he deemed desirable, and on the strength of the facts to seek the patronage of the public.\n Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 128, 27 A.L.R. 375, is not applicable. The statute there in question was deemed to have been \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 480]\n\u00a0\n applied to legalize conduct which was not simply peaceful picketing, not 'lawful persuasion or inducing,' not 'a mere appeal to the sympathetic aid of would-be customers by a simple statement of the fact of the strike and a request to withhold patronage.' It consisted of libelous attacks and abusive epithets against the employer and his friends; libelous and disparaging statements against the plaintiff's business; threats and intimidation directed against customers and employees. The means employed, in other words, were deemed to constitute 'an admitted tort,' conduct unlawful prior to the statute challenged. See \n257 \nU.S. 312\n, at pages 327, 328, 337, 346, 42 S.Ct. 124, 127, 128, 131, 134, 27 A.L.R. 375. In the present case the only means authorized by the statute and in fact resorted to by the unions have been peaceful and accompanied by no unlawful act. It follows, that if the end sought is constitutional-if the unions may constitutionally induce Senn to agree to refrain from exercising the right to work in his business with his own hands, their acts were lawful.\n Fourth. The end sought by the unions is not unconstitutional. Article III, which the unions seek to have Senn accept, was found by the state courts to be not arbitrary or capricious, but a reasonable rule 'adopted by the defendants out of the necessities of employment within the industry and for the protection of themselves as workers and craftsmen in the industry.' That finding is amply supported by the evidence. There is no basis for a suggestion that the unions' request that Senn refrain from working with his own hands, or their employment of picketing and publicity, was malicious; or that there was a desire to injure Senn. The sole purpose of the picketing was to acquaint the public with the facts and, by gaining its support, to induce Senn to unionize his shop. There was no effort to induce Senn to do an unlawful thing. There was no violence, no force was applied, no molestation or interference, no coercion. There \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 481]\n\u00a0\n was only the persuasion incident to publicity. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said:\n'Each of the contestants is desirous of the advantage of doing the business in the community where he or they operate. He is not obliged to yield to the persuasion exercised upon him by respondents. ... The respondents do not question that it is appellant's right to run his own business and earn his living in any lawful manner which he chooses to adopt. What they are doing is asserting their rights under the acts of the Legislature for the purpose of enhancing their opportunity to acquire work for themselves and those whom they represent. ... The respondents' act of peaceful picketing is a lawful form of appeal to the public to turn its patronage from appellant to the concerns in which the welfare of the members of the unions is bound up.'\n\n The unions acted, and had the right to act as they did, to protect the interests of their members against the harmful effect upon them of Senn's action. Compare American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 208\n, 209 S., 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360. Because his action was harmful, the fact that none of Senn's employees was a union member, or sought the union's aid, is immaterial.\n The laws of Wisconsin, as declared by its highest court, permit unions to endeavor to induce an employer, when unionizing his shop, to agree to refrain from working in his business with his own hands-so to endeavor although none of his employees is a member of a union. Whether it was wise for the state to permit the unions to do so is a question of its public policy-not our concern. The Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit it.\n Fifth. There is nothing in the Federal Constitution which forbids unions from competing with nonunion concerns for customers by means of picketing as freely as one merchant competes with another by means of advertisements in the press, by circulars, or by his win- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 482]\n\u00a0\n dow display. Each member of the unions, as well as Senn, has the right to strive to earn his living. Senn seeks to do so through exercise of his individual skill and planning. The union members seek to do so through combination. Earning a living is dependent upon securing work; and securing work is dependent upon public favor. To win the patronage of the public each may strive by legal means. Exercising its police power, Wisconsin has declared that in a labor dispute peaceful picketing and truthful publicity are means legal for unions. It is true that disclosure of the facts of the labor dispute may be annoying to Senn even if the method and means employed in giving the publicity are inherently unobjectionable. But such annoyance, like that often suffered from publicity in other connections, is not an invasion of the liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. Compare Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S.Ct. 278. 5 It is true, also, that disclosure of the facts may prevent Senn from securing jobs which he hoped to get. But a hoped-for job is not property guaranteed by the Constitution. And the diversion of it to a competitor is not an invasion of a constitutional right.\n Sixth. It is contended that in prohibiting an injunction the statute denied to Senn equal protection of the laws, and Truax v. Corrigan, supra, is invoked. But the issue suggested by plaintiff does not arise. For we hold that the provisions of the Wisconsin statute which authorized the conduct of the unions are constitutional. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 483]\n\u00a0\n One has no constitutional right to a 'remedy' against the lawful conduct of another.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissenting.\n Plaintiff is a tile layer and has long been accustomed to work as a helper and mechanic in that trade. The question presented is whether, consistently with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state may by statute authorize or make it lawful for labor unions to adopt and carry into effect measures intended and calculated to prevent him from obtaining or doing that work. The decision just announced answers that question in the affirmative. The facts are not in controversy. Let them disclose the concrete application of the legislation now held valid.\n Plaintiff lives and works in Milwaukee. Since the latter part of 1931, he has been engaged in performing small tile laying jobs. He has personally performed almost half the manual labor required. He usually employs a tile setter and helper; occasionally he has more than one of each. He has never been a member of the tile layers union. Though a competent mechanic in that trade, he is excluded from membership because he takes contracts and because he has not served the apprenticeship required by union rules. In 1935 he had about forty jobs. His net income was $1,500 of which $750 was attributed to his own labor. The balance, constituting his profit as contractor, was not enough to support him and family.\n Defendant Local No. 5 is composed of tile layers. Its membership, 112 in 1929, had fallen to 41 at the time of the trial in January, 1936. Early in 1935 it proffered to all local contractors including plaintiff a contract fixing wages, hours and the like. About half of them signed; the others did not. It contained the following: 'It is definitely understood that no individual, member of a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 484]\n\u00a0\n partnership or corporation engaged in the Tile Contracting Business shall work with the tools or act as Helper, but that the installation of all materials claimed by the party of the second part (Local No. 5) as listed under the caption 'Classification of Work' in this agreement, shall be done by journeymen members of Tile Layers Protective Union Local #5.' Because of that provision, plaintiff declined to sign. But repeatedly he declared to representatives of the union that he was willing to employ its members and to comply with its rules as to wages, hours, and working conditions; he assured them that, when his business was sufficient to permit, he would refrain from manual labor, and explained that without personally working he could not now continue in business. Conceding the truth of that statement, the union nevertheless persistently declined to modify its demands.\n The president of Local No. 5 testified that, if plaintiff did not sign the contract, it would do everything 'to harass and put things in his way'; that it intended to announce to the world that he is a nonunion contractor and on that account should not be patronized, to picket his place of business, to ascertain where he had jobs, and to picket them and in that way bring pressure to bear upon him to become a union contractor, to put him in the category of a nonunion contractor unless he agrees to lay aside the tools of the trade. The program so declared corresponds with what the unions had already done against him.\n In July, 1935, Local No. 5 sent to all contractors and architects letters stating: 'Some time ago we presented to each individual tile contractor in the city a copy of our new agreement (this refers to the one plaintiff was called on to sign) in which we specified what constitutes a bona fide contractor and who should install the work. Not having heard from some of these so called tile contractors in a given time, we beg of you to contact the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 485]\n\u00a0\n list of fair contractors listed below in awarding the tile work in your building operations. If in two weeks time anyone outside this list is awarded tile work we will then picket such jobs, contractors' or architects' offices, or employ other lawful means to help us in our fight to better the conditions of our trade.' Plaintiff's name was not on the list approved by the union. Therefore the letter meant that, in order to prevent him from working, the union would apply the described pressure to him, his work, the jobs of which his tile laying was a part, the contractors, and the architects from whom he got work.\n Commencing December 6, 1935, it put in front of his house two men carrying signs, one being: 'P. Senn Tile Company (meaning the plaintiff) is unfair to the Tile Layers Protective Union,' and the other: 'Let the Union tile layers install your tile work.' And regularly from 8 in the morning until noon and from 1 to 4 in the afternoon it carried on picketing of that sort, sometimes using four men. They refrained from speaking to plaintiff or others and committed no breach of the peace. In that sense they carried on 'peaceful picketing.' The union sent men in automobiles to follow plaintiff when going from his home to his work, and instructed all its members to discover where he had jobs in order to picket them.\n To justify the elimination of plaintiff, counsel told the court that 'because of the demoralized condition of the trade, the union decides it does not want a contractor, whether he be skilled in the trade or unskilled, to work with the tools of the trade with the men because there is not enough work to go around.' And on the witness stand the president of Local No. 5 expressed the idea that, if the contractors did not work, members of the union would be taken off relief.\n The trial court found the picketing peaceful and lawful; it did not pass on other acts constituting pressure \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 486]\n\u00a0\n put on plaintiff. But the unions themselves deemed unlawful much that they had threatened and done to coerce him. The findings say that 'the defendants, by their counsel, have stated in open court that they will not pursue the automobile of the plaintiff from his place of business to his jobs; that they will refrain from sending any further letters to architects or contractors, and will not indulge in any acts or conduct referred to in said letters towards said contractors and architects.' The trial court held plaintiff not entitled to relief. The Supreme Court affirmed. 222 Wis. 383, 268 N.W. 270, 872. Following its decision in American Furn. Co. v. I.B. of T.C. & H., 222 Wis. 338, 268 N.W. 250, 106 A. L.R. 335, construing section 103.62, it held that within the meaning of that section a 'labor dispute' existed between plaintiff and defendants and that under section 103.53 the picketing was legal.\n The clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment invoked by plaintiff are: 'No State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' Our decisions have made it everywhere known that these provisions forbid state action which would take from the individual the right to engage in common occupations of life, and that they assure equality of opportunity to all under like circumstances. Lest the importance or wisdom of these great declarations be forgotten or neglected, there should be frequent recurrence to decisions of this court that expound and apply them.\n'While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 487]\n\u00a0\n in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.' Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 29 A.L.R. 1446\n\n\n\n'The right to follow any of the common occupations of life is an inalienable right; it was formulated as such under the phrase 'pursuit of happiness' in the declaration of independence, which commenced with the fundamental proposition that 'all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' ... I hold that the liberty of pursuit-the right to follow any of the ordinary callings of life-is one of the privileges of a citizen of the United States.' Concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley in Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co., \n111 \nU.S. 746, 762\n, 4 S.Ct. 652, 657, approvingly quoted in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n, 17 S.Ct. 427.\n\n'Included in the right of personal liberty and the right of private property-partaking of the nature of each-is the right to make contracts for the acquisition of property. Chief among such contracts is that of personal employment, by which labor and other services are exchanged for money or other forms of property. If this right be struck down or arbitrarily interfered with, there is a substantial impairment of liberty in the long-established constitutional sense. The right is as essential to the laborer as to the capitalist, to the poor as to the rich; for the vast majority of persons have no other honest way to begin to acquire property, save by working for money.' Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 35 S.Ct. 240, 243, L.R.A.1915C, 960.\n\n'It requires no argument to show that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the com- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 488]\n\u00a0\n munity is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the Amendment to secure.' Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 41\n, 36 S.Ct. 7, 10, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283.\n\n'Under that amendment, nothing is more clearly settled than that it is beyond the power of a state, 'under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily (to) interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.\" New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262, 278\n, 52 S.Ct. 371, 374.\n\n'The fourteenth amendment ... undoubtedly intended not only that there should be no arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty, or arbitrary spoliation of property, but that equal protection and security should be given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment of their personal and civil rights; that all persons should be equally entitled to pursue their happiness, and acquire and enjoy property; that they should have like access to the courts of the country for the protection of their persons and property, the prevention and redress of wrongs, and the enforcement of contracts; that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of any one, except as applied to the same pursuits by others under like circumstances; that no greater burdens should be laid upon one than are laid upon others in the same calling and condition.' Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 \nU.S. 27, 31\n, 5 S.Ct. 357, 359.\n\n'For the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life, or the means of living, or any material right essential to the enjoyment of life, at the mere will of another, seems to be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself.' Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 370\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1071.\n\n The legislative power of the state can only be exerted in subordination to the fundamental principles of right and justice which the guaranties of the due process and \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 489]\n\u00a0\n equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment are intended to preserve. Arbitrary or capricious exercise of that power whereby a wrongful and highly injurious invasion of rights of liberty and property is sanctioned, stripping one of all remedy, is wholly at variance with those principles. Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 127, 27 A.L.R. 375.\n It may be assumed that the picketing, upheld in virtue of the challenged statute, lawfully might be employed in a controversy between employer and employees for the purpose of persuading the employer to increase pay, etc., and dissuading nonunion workers from displacing union members. The right of workers, parties to a labor dispute, to strike and picket peacefully to better their condition does not infringe any right of the employer. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 386\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 574, 27 A.L.R. 762; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 540\n, 541 S., 43 S.Ct. 630, 634, 635, 27 A.L.R. 1280; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 289\n, 44 S.Ct. 323, 324. But strikes or peaceful picketing for unlawful purposes are beyond any lawful sanction. The object being unlawful, the means and end are alike condemned. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 306, 311\n, 47 S.Ct. 86, 87; Toledo, A.A. & N.M. Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania Co. (C.C.) 54 F. 730, 737-739, 19 L.R. A. 387. And see Truax v. Corrigan, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 127, 27 A.L.R. 375; Exchange Bakery & Restaurant, Inc., v. Rifkin, 245 N.Y. 260, 262, 263, 157 N.E. 130.\n The object that defendants seek to attain is an unlawful one.\n Admittedly, it is to compel plaintiff to quit work as helper or title layer. Their purpose is not to establish on his jobs better wages, hours, or conditions. If permitted, plaintiff would employ union men and adhere to union requirements as to pay and hours. But, solely because he works, the unions refuse to allow him to unionize and carry on his business. By picketing, the unions would \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 490]\n\u00a0\n prevent him working on jobs he obtained from others and so destroy that business. Then, by enforcement of their rules they would prevent him from working as a journeyman for employers approved by the union or upon any job employing union men. Adhering to the thought that there is not enough work to go around, unquestionably the union purpose is to eliminate him from all tile laying work. And highly confirmatory of that purpsoe is the failure of the contract proposed by the union to permit plaintiff personally to do work in the performance of jobs undertaken by him for prices based upon union rates of pay for all labor, including his own.\n The principles governing competition between rival individuals seeking contracts or opportunity to work as journeymen cannot reasonably be applied in this case. Neither the union nor its members take tile laying contracts. Their interests are confined to employment of helpers and layers, their wages, hours of service, etc. The contest is not between unionized and other contractors or between one employer and another. The immediate issue is between the unions and plaintiff in respect of his right to work in the performance of his own jobs. If as to that they shall succeed, then will come the enforcement of their rules which make him ineligible to work as a journeyman. It cannot be said that, if he should be prevented from laboring as helper or layer, the work for union men to do would be increased. The unions exclude their members from jobs taken by nonunion employers. About half the tile contractors are not unionized. More than 60 per cent. of the tile layers are nonunion men. The value of plaintiff's labor as helper and tile layer is very small-about $750 per year. Between union members and plaintiff there is no immediate or direct competition. If under existing circumstances there ever can be any, it must come about through a chain of unpredictable events making \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 491]\n\u00a0\n its occurrence a mere matter of speculation. The interest of the unions in the manual labor done by plaintiff is so remote, indirect, and minute that they have no standing as competitors. Berry v. Donovan, 188 Mass. 353, 358, 74 N.E. 603. Under the circumstances here disclosed, the conduct of the unions was arbitrary and oppressive. Roraback v. Motion Picture Machine Operators' Union, 140 Minn. 481, 486, 168 N.W. 766, 169 N.W. 529, 3 A.L.R. 1290; Hughes v. Motion Picture Machine Operators, 282 Mo. 304, 221 S.W. 95.\n Moreover, the picketing was unlawful because the signs used constitute a misrepresentation of the facts. One of them declared plaintiff 'unfair' to the tile layers union and, upon the basis of that statement, the other sign solicited tile work for union tile layers. There was given neither definition of the word nor any fact on which the accusation was based. By the charge made, there was implied something unjust or inequitable in his attitude toward labor unions. But there was no foundation of fact for any such accusation. There was no warrant for characterizing him as 'unfair' or opposed to any legitimate purpose of the tile layers union or as unjust to union men. There is no escape from the conclusion that the unions intended by the picketing they carried on to misrepresent plaintiff in respect of his relation to, or dealing with, the tile layers union and by that means to deprive him of his occupation. The burden may not justly be held to be on him, by counter-picketing or otherwise, to refute or explain the baseless charge.\n The judgment of the state court, here affirmed, violates a principle of fundamental law: That no man may be compelled to hold his life or the means of living at the mere will of others. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, ubi supra. The state statute, construed to make lawful the employment of the means here shown to deprive plaintiff of his right to work or to make lawful the picketing carried on in this case, is repugnant to the due process and equal protection \n\n[301 \nU.S. 468, 492]\n\u00a0\n clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Truax v. Corrigan, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 328\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 128, 27 A.L.R. 375.\n I am of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Subsections (h), (i), and (k) are likewise relevant to the present issue, as supplementing subsections (e) and (l), but do not require special discussion. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The complaint as to certain action of defendants other than the picketing was disposed of by defendants' agreement to discontinue the same, and is not now in question. It had been shown that, with a view to picketing Senn's jobs, the unions had caused his automobile to be followed from his place of business to the jobs where he and his men were working. It had also been shown that, some months earlier, the unions had sent letters to local architects and contractors requesting them not to patronize Senn because he was conducting a non-union shop and threatening to picket them if they did so; but that there had been no picketing of any architect or contractor and no such steps had been taken by the unions. Through counsel, the unions agreed: (1) That thereafter they would not pursue plaintiff's automobile from his residence to his jobs; and (2) that they would refrain from sending any further letters to architects or contractors, and would not indulge in any acts or conduct referred to in the letters theretofore sent. The court treated this agreement by counsel as disposing of the claim for relief on this ground. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Zaat v. Building Trades Council, 172 Wash. 445, 20 P.(2d) 589; Roraback v. Motion Picture Machine Operators' Union, 140 Minn. 481, 168 N.w. 766, 169 N.W. 529, 3 A.L.R. 1290; Hughes v.

Boekhout, 249 App.Div. 77, 291 N.Y.S. 572. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That section provides:\n'The term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, or concerning employment relations, or any other controversy arising out of the respective interests of employer and employe, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The state has, of course, power to afford protection to interests of personality, such as 'the right of privacy.' The protection by decision or statute of such interests of personality rests on other considerations than are here involved. See Moreland, The Right of Privacy Today (1931) 19 Ky.L.J. 101; Lisle, The Right of Privacy (1931) 19 Ky.L.J. 137; Green, The Right of Privacy (1932) 27 Ill.L.Rev. 237, 238. \n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAPLEIGH v. MIER(1937)\nNo. 125\nArgued: December 9, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 468, 469]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. R. Gamble, of El Paso, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. Richard F. Burges, of El Paso, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The action is trespass for the trial of title.\n Plaintiffs, petitioners here, are citizens of Missouri; defendant, respondent here, is a citizen of Mexico. A tract of 337 acres in Texas, known as 'El Guayuco Banco No. 319,' on the left bank of the Rio Grande river, is the subject-matter of the controversy. A jury having been waived, the trial was by a judge, who made his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and gave judgment for defendant. From this there was an appeal, its scope, however, narrowed by the manner of the trial and the form of the decision. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Gray, \n292 \nU.S. 332\n, 54 S.Ct. 722; Harvey Co. v. Malley, \n288 \nU.S. 415\n, 53 S.Ct. 426; Fleischmann Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349\n, 46 S.Ct. 284. A single question was open: Were the conclusions of law supported by the facts as found, when supplemented by any other facts within the range of judicial notice? The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 83 F.(2d) 673. We granted certiorari to pass upon the contention, strongly pressed by the petitioners, that their rights had been illegally divested through the action of a foreign government.\n The land in controversy was once part of the Mexican State of Chihuahua. In 1926 it was cut by avulsion from \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 470]\n\u00a0\n the south or right bank of the Rio Grande to the north or left bank, and became part of the United States. By the ordinary rule a change of location resulting from avulsion would have left Mexico still sovereign over the territory thus moved, the center of the old channel remaining as the boundary. Missouri v. Nebraska, \n196 \nU.S. 23, 35\n, 25 S.Ct. 155; Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 361\n, 367 S., 370, 12 S.Ct. 396. Here a different rule applied by force of a convention, proclaimed June 5, 1907 (35 Stat.1863), whereby the boundaries were to shift in the event of future changes, with exceptions not now material as to population and area. A boundary commission, previously established but confirmed by the convention, marked the change upon the ground. Sovereignty was thus transferred, but private ownership remained the same. United States v. Chaves, \n159 \nU.S. 452, 457\n, 16 S.Ct. 57; United States v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51, 86. To find the title to the land today we must know where title stood while the land was yet in Mexico.\n In 1925, before the river had wrought the change, proceedings were begun for the division of a 'latifundium,' which embraced the land in controversy, and for its acquisition by the state. A petition in due form was submitted to the Governor of Chihuahua, and resulted in a decree, dated March 5, 1925, whereby the State of Chihuahua was proclaimed to be the owner. The District Judge has found the the plaintiffs and those from whom they trace their claim were notified of the proceedings and were given the opportunity to prove their title, but failed to do so. The judge has also found that the proceedings were regular and valid, that there was no requirement in the Constitution or laws of Mexico whereby payment must be made or secured at or before the time of expropriation, and that by force of the decree the plaintiffs were divested of any title that had been theirs. Following this expropriation, the defendant, who is now in possession, filed with the proper officials an application \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 471]\n\u00a0\n that he be permitted to buy the lands in suit, acquiring by that request an inchoate or potential interest, which was afterwards perfected by the payment of the purchase price.\n Petitioners concede that the expropriation decree, if lawful and effective under the Constitution and laws of Mexico, must be recognized as lawful and effective under the laws of the United States, the sovereignty of Mexico at the time of that decree being exclusive of any other.

Bartlesville Zinc Co., 115 Tex. 21, 275 S.W. 388, 41 A.L.R. 737. The question is not here whether the proceeding was so conducted as to be a wrong to our nationals under the doctrines of international law, though valid under the law of the situs of the land. For wrongs of that order the remedy to be followed is along the channels of diplomacy. 'A citizen of one nation wronged by the conduct of another nation, must seek redress through his own government.' United States v. Diekelman, \n92 U.S. 520\n, 524; Cf. Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 230; Young v. United States, \n97 \nU.S. 39, 67\n, 68 S.; Frelinghuysen v. Key, \n110 \nU.S. 63, 71\n, 75 S., 3 S.Ct. 462. Indeed, a tribunal is in existence, the International Claims Commission, established by convention between the United States and Mexico, to which the plaintiffs are at liberty to submit and have long ago submitted a claim for reparation. Convention of September 8, 1923, proclaimed March 3, 1924; 43 Stat. 1730. What concerns us here and now is the efficacy of the decree under the land law of Mexico at the date of its proclamation to extinguish hostile claims of ownership and pass the title to another. \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 472]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners are content thus to limit the inquiry, if we read their argument aright. They insist that the decree which purports to divest them of their title is a nullity even by the law of Mexico and that it is the duty of our courts, if the nullity has been made out, to adjudge ownership accordingly. Meeting the objection that the acts of an independent government done in its own territory are not subject to re-examination by the courts of another (Underhill v. Hernandez, supra; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., supra; Hewitt v. Speyer, supra; Oliver Am. Trading Co. v. Gov't of United States of Mexico, supra), they say that the land in controversy is now a part of the United States; that it was brought into our domain by a treaty of cession, the avulsion being merely the occasion that made the treaty operative; and that in passing upon the validity of the Mexican decree we are adjudicating a claim of title to part of our own soil. To do this, they maintain, is an incident of the judicial function. Meeting the objection that by the findings of the trial court the decree and the proceedings leading up to it are valid, they make a twofold answer. They say that the laws formerly prevailing in territory acquired by treaty or convention are those of an antecedent government rather than a foreign one, and are the subject of judicial notice. Fremont v. United States, 17 How. 542, 557; United States v. Perot, \n98 \nU.S. 428, 429\n, 430 S.; United States v. Chaves, supra, \n159 U.S. 452\n, at page 459, 16 S.Ct. 57. They say again that if such notice is not appropriate, a finding as to a foreign law is not solely one of fact, but one of fact and law compounded, which may be reviewed upon appeal, like a finding in certain circumstances as to the meaning of a document. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 5,  2558; Fitzpatrick v. International R. Co., 252 N.Y. 127, 139, 140, 169 N.E. 112, 68 A.L.R. 801; Saloshin v. Houle, 85 N.H. 126, 155 A. 47; Compania Transcontinental v.

To delimit them with accuracy is unnecessary now, for, accepting them, provisionally, in their fullest length and breadth, we and the expropriating decree to be proof against assault. The defect imputed to it is expropriation in advance of payment or without adequate security, either payment or security being necessary in the view of the petitioners to effect a change of title. What the decree does provide is that there shall be 'indemnity' to the owners, whoever they may be, for every interest condemned, and that bonds of the state shall be delivered as a medium of payment. Experts testifying for the defendant tell us that such indemnity is adequate under the Constitution of the Federal Republic (Constitution of Mexico, 1917, Art. 27), and also under the Agrarian Law of the State of Chihuahua. Cf. Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380\n, 16 S.Ct. 43; Crozier v. Fried Kruppaktiengesellschaft, \n224 \nU.S. 290, 306\n, 32 S.Ct. 488; Phillips v.

The pertinent articles are quoted in the record, and give reasonable support to the opinion so expressed.* Other witnesses testifying for the plain\n * Constitution of Mexico, 1917, Article 27:\n'Private property shall not be expropriated except for reasons of public utility and by means of indemnification.\n\n'The Nation shall have at all times the right to impose on private property such limitations as the public interest may demand as well as the right to regulate the development of natural resources, which are susceptible of appropriation, in order to conserve them and equitably to distribute the public wealth. For this purpose necessary measures shall be taken to divide large landed estates; to develop small landed holdings . ... Private property acquired for the said purposes shall be considered as taken for public utility. ...\n\n'During the next constitutional term, the Congress and the State Legislatures shall enact laws, within their respective jurisdictions, for the purpose of carrying out the division of large landed estates, subject to the following conditions. ...\n\n'(e) The owners shall be bound to receive bonds of a special issue to guarantee the payment of the property expropriated. With this end in view, the Congress shall issue a law authorizing the States to issue bonds to meet their agrarian obligations.' \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 474]\n\u00a0\n tiffs advance a different view. Opinions of the Supreme Court of Mexico are laid before us in the briefs, and were summarized by the witnesses, though they were not exhibits at the trial. One gives color of support to the view advanced for the petitioners. Five of later date tend the other way. There is testimony that by the law of Mexico five decisions are necessary to give rise to a controlling precedent. For anything to the contrary appearing in the record, the claimants are still at liberty, though their estate has been divested, to receive delivery of bonds of the State of Chihuahua upon giving evidence of title.\n\n In what has been written, we have assumed in favor of the petitioners, but without intending to decide, that the land law of Mexico in the territory now part of Texas is a proper subject of judicial notice. The assumption helps \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 475]\n\u00a0\n them nothing. A different case would be here if they were able to refer us to documents or other evidence dehors the present record establishing a different rule from that stated in the findings. In such conditions, the doctrine of judicial notice might be a crutch on which to lean. But none of these extrinsic aids to judgment has been placed at our disposal. Neither through any reference to documents nor through other sources of information has anything been added to what has been developed by the witnesses in the pages of this record. The situation is thus the same, whatever the extension of the doctrine of judicial notice, as if the record stood alone.\n Heed must be given to the burden of proof, at least when other tests are lacking. In this action to establish ownership, petitioners must recover, if at all, on the strength of their own title. Judicial notice is unavailing to rid them of that burden. To say that a court will take judicial notice of a fact, whether it be an event or a custom or a law of some other government, is merely another way of saying that the usual forms of evidence will be dispensed with if knowledge of the fact can be otherwise acquired. Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 5,  2567; Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on the Law of Evidence, pp. 277, 308. But the truth, of course, is that judicial notice and judicial knowledge are far from being one. The law is not so vain as to make pretense of their identity. To the contrary, a court that is left without knowledge of a fact after exploring to the full every channel of information must needs decide against the litigant who counts upon the fact as an essential of his claim. De non apparentibus et de non existentibus eadem est ratio.\n We are not persuaded upon this record, supplemented by everything now brought to our attention, that the law of Mexico is other than by the concurrent judgments of the courts below it has been here adjudged to be. That \n\n[299 U.S. 468, 476]\n\u00a0\n being so, petitioners have not maintained the burden of overcoming the decree. Their claim of title fails.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Agrarian Law of the State of Chihuahua:\n'Article third: Owners of larger extensions of lands than those prefixed in Article 1st, are under the obligations to divide into fractions their lands, and, to this effect a term of ninety days is granted them from the date on which this law goes into effect, so that they may select the extension of land they can keep; and another term of six months, from same date, is granted them for the formulation of the project for the division into fractions of the land in excess, which project is to be submitted to the Executive of the State for its approval attaching thereto corresponding plats of the land together with authentic title deeds.'\n\n'Article sixth: By the mere fact that the owners, do not present the plats to the Executive of the State in the form and terms as provided for in the article 3rd., it shall be understood that they refuse to divide the latifundium, into fractions, and the Executive of the State shall carry it out (the division into fractions of said latifundium) by means of expropriation in accordance to provision of subsection C, or the section VII of Article 27th, of the General Constitution.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHOSHONE TRIBE OF INDIANS v.

Jurisdiction to hear the claim was conferred upon the Court of Claims by an Act of March 3, 1927 (44 Stat. 1349, part 2), which, so far as its provisions are now material, is quoted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n The court gave judgment for the claimant. 82 Ct.Cl. 23. Neither party to the controversy was satisfied with the award of damages, the claimant finding it too low and the government too high. There were cross-petitions for certiorari. To fix with certainty and justice the rights and duties of the government in its relations with an Indian tribe, the writs were allowed, and the case is here accordingly.\n By Treaty of July 3, 1868 (15 Stat. 673), the Shoshone Tribe of Indians relinquished to the United States a reservation of 44,672,000 acres in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, and accepted in exchange a reservation of 3,054,182 acres in Wyoming, with other benefits not now important. The United States agreed that the territory described in the treaty now generally known as the Wind River Reservation would be 'set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Shoshone Indians ... and for such other friendly tribes \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n or individual Indians as from time to time they may be willing, with the consent of the United States, to admit amongst them.' 15 Stat. 674, art. 2. Reinforcing this covenant, there was a solemn pledge of faith by the United States that no persons, except a few specially enumerated, and governmental agents engaged in the discharge of duties enjoined by law, should 'ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside' in the territory so reserved. Article 2. The loyalty of the Shoshone Tribe to the people of the United States has been conspicuous and unfaltering. A fidelity at least as constant and inflexible was owing in return.\n In 1869, a band of the Northern Arapahoes, separating from the main body of the nation, was wandering about the country, looking for a home. The Arapahoes had been allies of the Sioux. who were the foes of the Shoshones. None the less, the wanderers expressed a wish to have a refuge and a settlement on the Wind River Reservation. They came upon the reservation in 1870, and were informed by Washakie, Chief of the Shoshones, that they would be permitted to stay there for a short time while the government was seeking to place them elsewhere. After a few months they moved away. The government had no success, however, in providing them with a satisfactory home, and they continued to cast longing eyes toward the fair and fertile acres set apart for their ancestral foes. At the instance of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, acting in co-operation with the Secretary of the Interior, a new attempt was made in October, 1877, to bring the tribes together and relieve the growing tension developing between them. One Irwin, formerly the Indian agent on the Wind River Reservation, discussed the problem with Washakie. He said that the President had no intention of placing the Arapahoes on the Shoshone Reservation, but that the desire was merely to insure peace between the tribes and to find a place for the Arapahoes nearby, on a separate tract of \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n land close to the eastern boundary. Washakie agreed that there should be peace, but insisted that the traditional enemies of his tribe be placed at a safe distance, predicting that close contact would bring friction and fresh hostility.\n Irwin telegraphed the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington on October 17, 1877: 'I returned from Shoshone Agency today. Held a council and made peace between Shoshones and Arapahoes.' A written report, dated February 21, 1878, gave the details of the council. Even so, the telegram, it seems, had been misunderstood by the Commissioner, for in his annual report for 1877 (dated November 1, 1877), he said (page 19): 'In a formal council held last month by Agent Irwin with the Shoshones, their consent to the arrangement desired by the Arapahoes was obtained, and the removal of the latter is now in progress.' Ignoring many warnings in February and later that consent had been refused, the Commissioner adhered to his erroneous assumption. The consequences of his error are visible in the events that followed.\n On March 18, 1878, a band of Northern Arapahoes was brought to the Reservation of the Shoshones under military escort. The reservation had been reduced to 2,343,000 acres by the cession of 700,642 acres in 1874 for a money consideration. The Shoshones believed that for hunting and for husbandry it was not in excess of present needs. The unheralded arrival of the Arapahoes was the cause of much excitement. There was a council the next day, at which the leader of the Arapahoes explained to Washakie that they and their horses were weary and without food, and in need of rest and care. Thereupon Washakie agreed that they might remain for a short time to rest their horses and themselves. But the Indian Commissioner, it seems, had not brought them to the reservation for any temporary visit. On April 2, 1878, he telegraphed the agent at the reservation to furnish the \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n Arapahoes with the necessary food and supplies, and directed him to 'report fully by mail what other measures are necessary to locate the Band of Northern Arapahoe Indians under Black Coal,' their leader. The agent responded that the Shoshones looked upon the presence of the Arapahoes as 'an encroachment on their rights.' At the request of both tribes, he urged the calling of a council to be attended by the Department Commander, General Crook, in order that the location of the Arapahoes might be permanently settled. No reply to this request came from the Commissioner or from any one else.\n The famished Arapahoes and their horses had been fed and cared for, but they did not move away. Instead of moving away, they came in increasing numbers. As early as April 8, 1878, nearly the whole tribe was on the scene. Washakie protested to the agent. The agent at frequent intervals communicated the protests to the Commissioner. There was nothing in return but silence. Months lengthened into years, and the signs accumulated steadily that the Arapahoes were there to stay. Schools were established for their benefit to the end that their youth might be adequately trained. Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1879, p. 169. Ditches were dug for the irrigation of their ranches. Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1889, p. 308. In numberless other ways their equality of right and privilege became a postulate of daily life. At length, in August, 1891, the flame of controversy blazed forth anew. The 'Woodruff Commission' had been sent to the reservation to treat with the Indians for a cession of a portion of their lands. The Shoshones took the ground that the Arapahoes should not be suffered to take part in the council and vote upon the projects. The Commission telegraphed the Commissioner of Indians Affairs, asking for instructions. In reply, August 13, 1891, the Commissioner notified the Commission: 'This office holds ... that the Arap- \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n ahoes have equal rights to the land on the said reservation which does not depend upon the further consent of the Shoshones, and you should conduct your negotiations with them upon that basis and with that understanding.' Accordingly, both tribes participated in the council, though a cession was not effected.\n The Commissioner continued to act on the assumption that the occupancy of the Arapahoes, initiated, as we have seen, under military escort, was permanent and rightful. What is more to the point, Congress did the same. Thus, in 1897, the government by its agent concluded an agreement with the Shoshones and Arapahoes whereby the Indians ceded to the government part of the Shoshones Reservation (55,040 acres) for $60, 000, to be expended without discrimination among the members of the tribes. In preliminary conferences the Shoshones protested that they alone should receive the stipulated payments. Their protest was overruled, though they succeeded in adding a proviso that nothing in the agreement was to be construed to deprive them of their annuities or benefits under any existing agreements or treaty stipulations. This agreement with its clear recognition of the occupancy of the Arapahoes and their equal interest in the land was ratified by act of Congress. Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3,  12, 30 Stat. 62, 93, 94. Again on April 21, 1904, the government made an agreement with the two tribes for the cession of a large tract (1,480,000 acres), leaving only 808,500 acres in the diminished reservation. Again the Shoshones protested that the Arapahoes were intruders, and refused to sign without a proviso similar to the one in the agreement of 1897.2 \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n Again the government dealt with the two tribes as lawful occupants and equals. This agreement like the earlier one was ratified by act of Congress. Act of March 3, 1905, c. 1452, 33 Stat. 1016. It provides inter alia that 'any individual Indian, a member of the Shoshone or Arapahoe tribes, who has, under existing laws or treaty stipulations, selected a tract of land within the portion of said reservation hereby ceded, shall be entitled to have the same allotted and confirmed to him or her, and any Indian who has made or received an allotment of land within the ceded territory shall have the right to surrender such allotment and select other lands within the diminished reserve in lieu thereof at any time before the lands hereby ceded shall be opened for entry.' There is a finding that 245,058 acres were allotted to Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians between 1907 and 1919 under the power thus conferred. Many other provisions of the agreement and the statute are almost equally explicit and significant in their recognition of the status quo. No where is there a suggestion that the occupancy of the newcomers is impermanent or provisional.\n The Arapahoes held their ground, pushing the Shoshones farther to the west, and retaining for themselves the eastern section of the reservation, found by the Court of Claims to be the most eligible portion. At all times the population of each of the two tribes has been approximately equal. There continued to come forth from the Shoshones intermittent protests, which at last reached the halls of Congress, and in 1927 had a long- delayed fruition. In that year the Committee on Indian Affairs of the House of Representatives reported a bill to make atonement for the wrongs that for nearly half a century had been left without redress. House Report No. 1628, 69th Congress, 2d Session, Congressional Record, vol. 68, part 1, p. 625. \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n Extracts from that report are printed in the margin. \n3\n The bill so proposed was passed, but was vetoed by the President, chiefly for the reason that it made provision for the payment of interest at 5 per cent. per annum on the value of any property appropriated in violation of the treaty or wrongfully disposed of. Congressional Record, vol. 68, part 3, p. 2414, 69th Congress, 2d Session. On February 4, 1927, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported a new bill, with the statement that it had been redrafted to correct the objection of the President and that it was identical with the earlier bill except for the interest provision, though in truth other verbal changes had been made in the process of revision. Senate Report No. 1389, Congressional Record, vol. 68, part 3, p. 2921. The bill so revised became chapter 302 of the Laws of 1927 (44 Stat. 1349), the jurisdictional act under which the present suit has been maintained.\n Upon these facts the Court of Claims decided that the occupancy of the Arapahoes became definitive and perma- \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n nent on August 13, 1891, when the Commissioner of Indian Affairs made public statement of his opinion that they were entitled to enjoy the reservation equally with the Shoshones. The value at that time of an undivided half interest in the land was found to be $2,050,597.50. The value of the use and occupation between March 18, 1878, and August 13, 1891, was fixed at $332,475. The sum of these values, along with a few minor items, was.$2,483,467.99, from which there was a deduction of $1,689, 646.50, for offsets owing to the government, and not in controversy here. The balance, $793,821.49, is the amount of the judgment now before us for review. As already stated, neither the claimant nor the government is content with the decision. Both agree that there was error in fixing the value of the land as of August 13, 1891. The claimant insists that it should be reckoned as of March 3, 1927, the date of the jurisdictional act, and that compensation should be added for the value of the intermediate use and occupation. The government insists that the value should be reckoned as of March 18, 1878, when the unlawful occupancy began. The claimant makes the additional point that, irrespective of the date at which the value is computed, interest must be awarded up to the date of the judgment on the recovery allowed.\n First: The Court of Claims did not err in refusing to fix the damages on the basis of the value of the land on March 3, 1927\n\n\n The claimant takes the ground that the jurisdictional act is an exercise of the power of eminent domain. The argument is that by force of its provisions a trespass which had been unlawful, though continuous, since March 18, 1878, was turned as of March, 1927, into a definitive and lawful taking. But this is to mistake utterly the design and meaning of the statute. The jurisdictional act is not a taking of anything. It 'makes no admission of liability, or of any ground of liability, on the \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n part of the government, but merely provides a forum for the adjudication of the claim according to applicable legal principles.' United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewa Indians, \n229 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 33 S.Ct. 811, 812. No cause of action can be vindicated thereunder unless such a cause of action as, apart from the impediment of governmental immunity from suit, was already in existence. Under the jurisdictional act the court is to inquire whether the violation of the treaty of 1868 or of some later treaty or agreement or some later act of Congress has given rise to legal or equitable grounds of liability. True, the decree when it is made 'shall be in full settlement of all damages, if any, committed by the Government of the United States and shall annul and cancel all claim, right, and title of the said Shoshone Indians in and to such money, lands, or other property.' But the claimant is not subject to a duty either under that act or any other to sue the government at all. In the event of a failure to sue or to prosecute the suit to a decree, rights and liabilities will remain as they were before any act was passed. The sovereign power is not exercised to extinguish titles or other interests against the will of tribal occupants by force of eminent domain.\n If this conclusion might otherwise be doubtful (which we do not suggest), the doubt would be dispelled by a consideration of the history of the statute. The reports of the Committees of Congress preceding the two bills-the one vetoed by the President and the one enacted into law- make it plain that the purpose was to give reparation to the claimant for an 'alleged unlawful appropriation' effected in the past, not to make a new and lawful appropriation by an exercise of sovereign power. So the message of the President vetoing the first bill which permitted an award of interest adds this comment to a sketch of the grievance of the tribe: 'It seems to me unreasonable to expect that the Government should be \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n charged with interest from the dates of origin of such ancient claims.' Congress had no thought in its revision of the rejected bill to prescribe present expropriation in lieu of present reparation. As pointed out already, the bill redrafted was understood to be identical with the first one except that the interest provision had been dropped to meet the President's objection.\n Second: The Court of Claims erred in holding that damages should be measured as of August 13, 1891, the date of the letter from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Woodruff Commission, and in failing to measure them as of 1878, the date of the unlawful entry.\n The treaty of 1868 charged the government with a duty to see to it that strangers should never be permitted without the consent of the Shoshones to settle upon or reside in the Wind River Reservation. That duty was not fufilled. Instead, the Arapahoes were brought upon the reservation with a show of military power, and kept there is definance of the duty to expel them. The decision below is based upon the theory that the letter of August 13, 1891, is the earliest overt act evincing a definitive purpose to make the occupancy permanent. But the Commissioner of Indian Affairs was not empowered to fix the future policy of the government, still less to exercise in its behalf the power of eminent domain. He made no such attempt. All that his letter of August, 1891, expresses is an opinion as to the meaning and operation of notorious and accomplished facts. By deed as well as by word, he had done his part for more than thirteen years in shaping those facts to conform to his opinion. He had made report to the Secretary of the Interior in November, 1877, that the transfer of the Arapahoes to the Wind River Reservation was a movement then in progress. He had notified the local agent in April, 1878, to indicate any other measures necessary to settle the intruders. He had turned a deaf ear to many a remonstrance by the tribe \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 495]\n\u00a0\n whose possession had been violated. In so far as his own opinion and intention were facts of any moment, he had manifested them too often and too plainly, by conduct and by speech alike, to leave his attitude in doubt. Little wonder that counsel for the claimant are at one with counsel for the government in rejecting August, 1891, as the date when occupancy became more than a temporary trespass.\n If the date adopted by the Court of Claims is not accepted as the true one, the question is before us, what other shall be substituted? Looking at events in retrospect through the long vista of the years, we can see that from the outset the occupancy of the reservation was intended to be permanent; that, however tortious in its origin, it has been permanent in fact; and that the government of the United States, through the action and inaction of its executive and legislative departments for half a century of time, has ratified the wrong, adopting the de facto appropriation by relation as of the date of its beginning. To see the facts in true perspective we must view them in their totality and not in isolation. There are the reports at the beginning as to the purpose of the settlement; the words and the silence of administrative officers when entreated to banish the intruders; the creation of schools for the education of their youth as for that of the youth already there (Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1879, p. 169); and, most important of all, the statutes already summarized, recognizing the Arapahoes equally with the Shoshones as occupants of the land, accepting their deeds of cession, assigning to the tribes equally the privilege of new allotments, and devoting to the two equally the award of future benefits. What meaning can be ascribed to all these cumulative tokens of intention unless it be that the intruders have been confirmed in their occupancy as of the date of the intrusion? Cf. United States v. Creek \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 496]\n\u00a0\n Nation, \n295 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 55 S.Ct. 681, 684. The Shoshones might protest, as they did, that in setting their hands to the agreement, they did not assent to the violation of treaty stipulations. They might reserve as much as they pleased claims, present and past, for the recovery of damages. Whatever their provisos, the outstanding fact remained that for good or for ill the Arapahoes were to dwell upon the soil along with them. 'The adoption by the United States of the wrongful act of any officer is, of course, an adoption of the act when and as committed, and causes such act of the officer to be, in virtue of the statute, a rightful appropriation by the government, for which compensation is provided.' Crozier v. Fried Krupp Aktiengesellschaft, \n224 \nU.S. 290, 305\n, 32 S.Ct. 488, 491.\n Confusion is likely to result from speaking of the wrong to the Shoshones as a destruction of their title. Title in the strict sense was always in the United States, though the Shoshones had the treaty right of occupancy with all its beneficial incidents. United States v. Creek Nation, supra, \n295 U.S. 103\n, at page 109, 55 S.Ct. 681, 683, 684. What those incidents are, it is needless to consider now. Cf. United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591; Pine River Logging & Imp, Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279\n, 22 S.Ct. 920; United States v. Paine Lumber Co., \n206 \nU.S. 467\n, 27 S.Ct. 697. The right of occupancy is the primary one to which the incidents attach and division of the right with strangers is an appropriation of the land pro tanto, in substance, if not in form.\n Third: The claimant's damages include such additional amount beyond the value of its property rights when taken by the government as may be necessary to award of just compensation, the increment to be measured either by interest on the value or by such other standard as may be suitable in the light of all the circumstances.\n The fact is unimportant that the taking was tortious in its origin, if it was made lawful by relation. Crozier \n\n[299 U.S. 476, 497]\n\u00a0\n v. Fried Krupp, etc., supra. The fact also is unimportant that it was a partial taking only, and that eviction was not complete. Jacobs v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 13, 16\n, 54 S.Ct. 26, 27, 28, 96 A.L.R. 1; United States v. Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 327-330, 37 S.Ct. 380; Hurley v. Kincaid, \n285 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 52 S.Ct. 267, 269. Finally the fact is unimportant, there having been an appropriation of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, that the jurisdictional act is silent as to an award of interest or any substitute therefor. United States v. Creek Nation, supra, \n295 U.S. 103\n, at page 110, 111, 55 S.Ct. 681, 684; Cf. Yankton Sioux Tribe v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 351, 359\n, 47 S.Ct. 142, 144. Given such a taking, the right to interest or a fair equivalent, attaches itself automatically to the right to an award of damages. Jacobs v. United States, supra; Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341\n, 47 S.Ct. 611; Brooks-Scanolon Co. v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 123\n, 44 S.Ct. 471, 474; Seaboard Air Line Co. v.

Nor does the nature of the right divested avail to modify the rule. Power to control and manage the property and affairs of Indians in good faith for their betterment and welfare may be exerted in many ways and at times even in derogation of the provisions of a treaty. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 553, 564\n, 565 S., 566, 23 S.Ct. 216. The power does not extend so far as to enable the government 'to give the tribal lands to others, or to appropriate them to its own purposes, without rendering, or assuming an obligation to render, just compensation ; ... for that would not be an exercise of guardianship, but an act of confiscation.\" United States v. Creek Nation, supra, \n295 U.S. 103\n, at page 110, 55 S.Ct. 681, 684, citing Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, \n249 \nU.S. 110, 13\n, 39 S.Ct. 185; Cherokee Nation v.

Since then the Shoshones have frequently protested against the alleged unlawful appropriation of their reservation but have received no relief from the Government. On the contrary, the Government has allowed the Arapahoes upon the reservation and treated the funds claimed by the Shoshones as though they were the joint property of both tribes.\n\n'The purpose of the bill is to permit the Shoshones to submit their claims for alleged appropriation of property to the Court of Claims, and your committee feels that in view of the strong showing made the bill should be enacted at an early date.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHULMAN v.

Bentley Pike, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 172, 173]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In a proceeding under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended ( 11 U.S.C.A.  207), for the reorganization of the Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Company, petitioners filed a claim for $1,750. The basis of the claim was a balance alleged to be due pursuant to an allowance of $2,250 by a decree of the state court in a foreclosure suit antedating the proceedings in the bankruptcy court. That allowance was stated to be for legal services rendered by petitioners and the amount was 'to be paid in due course of administration.' Of this amount petitioners received $500 under a later order of the state court, leaving $1,750 unpaid. Upon the confirmation of the plan of reorganization, the District Court reserved jurisdiction to pass upon the petitioners' claim at the time of the allowance of fees and expenses; and, on the subsequent hearing of the application for such allowances to be charged as costs of administration, the claim was disallowed. An appeal from the order, not having been allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction. In re Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., 86 F.(2d) 898. Certiorari was granted March 1, 1937. \n300 \nU.S. 649\n, 57 S.Ct. 509, 81 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioners urge that the appeal should have been entertained under section 25a of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended (11 U.S.C.A.  48(a), as an appeal from a judgment rejecting a claim of over $500, or under section 24a, as amended (11 U.S.C.A.  47(a), as an appeal from a determination of a controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings. Neither contention is sound. The allowance by the state court for legal services fixed an amount but without direction to pay, and the allowance remained subject to the supervising control of the court until payment was directed. Compare People v. Illinois State Bank, 312 Ill. 613, 616, 144 N.E. 327; Hume v. Myers (C.C.A.) 242 F. 827, 830. There was no finality of action in this respect prior to the proceeding in the bankruptcy court and the allowance was a purely administrative matter upon which the latter \n\n[301 \nU.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n court was entitled to pass. The record shows that petitioners' claim was pressed, heard, and determined as one belonging in that category.\n The case of Duparquet Huot & Moneuse Co. v. Evans, \n297 \nU.S. 216\n, 56 S. Ct. 412, is not in point. There is no question here as to the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the proceeding for reorganization. The order was made in the exercise of the general jurisdiction conferred by section 77B(a) of the act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207(a), which embraced the authority to pass upon fees and expenses incident to administration, including claims such as the present one for legal services rendered in the prior suit in the state court.

Silas Mason, Inc. v. State Tax Commission, 188 Wash. 98, 61 P.2d 1269; Ryan v. State, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276. The cases come here on appeal.\n The questions are (1) whether the tax imposes an unconstitutional burden upon the Federal Government, and (2) whether the areas in which appellants' work is performed are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. On reargument, and at the request of the Court, the views of the Government upon these questions were presented. With respect to the first question, our ruling upholding the validity of a similar tax of West Virginia as laid upon the gross receipts of a contractor engaged in building locks and dams for the United States is controlling. James v. Dravo Contracting Company, \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S.Ct. 208. We pass to the question of territorial jurisdiction.\n\n 1. \nThe following facts as to the nature and history of the enterprise, as set forth in appellants' complaints and shown by evidence and stipulations, are uncontroverted: The Columbia River, above its lower reaches, partakes of the character of a mountain stream, its fall being great, its current swift, and its course marked at intervals of a few miles by rapids flowing over and through rocky masses of such magnitude as to render navigation difficult and in many instances impossible save by the construction of canals and locks. There are great alternations in its flow, its period of high water depending upon the melting of snow in the mountains where its sources are found. Its principal tributary is the Snake River, which has the same characteristics. Through improvements that have been made and are contemplated, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 191]\n\u00a0\n the Columbia River is commercially navigable from its mouth to the mouth of the Snake, and above that point the Columbia is navigable locally, from pool to pool, to the mouth of the Okanogan River, but all such navigation is difficult and not commercially feasible because of the physical conditions above described. These characteristics, however, 'render it an ideal stream for the development of hydroelectric power.' For the most part the Columbia River within the United States flows through an arid country, 'the land being immensely productive and rich when placed under irrigation but of no value without irrigation.' The course of the river for the greater part of its length in the United States lies wholly within the State of Washington. From a short distance below the mouth of the Snake, the Columbia is the boundary between the States of Washington and Oregon.\n Following sporadic improvements extending over a number of years, the Corps of Engineers of the War Department finally made an exhaustive survey, and in 1932 the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army recommended a comprehensive plan for the development of the Columbia River, which took into consideration the use of its waters for the purposes of navigation, flood control, power development, and irrigation. The plan contemplated the construction of ten dams across the river at various points in Washington and where the river is the boundary between Washington and Oregon. The uppermost of these dams is at the head of Grand Coulee in Washington about 150 miles below the international boundary and 274 miles above the mouth of the Snake River. The plan was commonly described as the Columbia Basin Project.\n In June, 1933, Harold L. Ickes was appointed Administrator of Public Works, and later the President, under authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act (sections \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 192]\n\u00a0\n 201-203, 48 Stat. 200-205 (40 U.S.C.A.  401-403)), directed the Administrator to include in the Public Works program the Grand Coulee Dam and Power Plant. Appellants state that the project as finally recommended by the War Department and the Department of the Interior contemplated, among other features, a dam at the Grand Coulee to be 370 feet high above low water (550 feet high, as actually constructed) and 4,290 feet long on the crest, and a power plant to develop 2,100,000 horse power, at a total cost of $392,000,000. Appellants add that this is the key dam on the river and will create a lake 150 miles long, reaching the Canadian boundary; that over 5,000,000 acrefeet of storage will become available, the release of which when the flow of the river is at its lowest will double the prime power of the river downstream to the Snake River and add more than 50 per cent. to the power of the Columbia below the Snake; that the storage will have an appreciable effect in reducing floods on the whole river; and that 'there will be 905,500 acres of first class land available for irrigation.'\n In 1933, the Legislature of the State of Washington created the Columbia Basin Commission to promote the Columbia Basin Project. Laws 1933, c. 81, p. 376; Ryan v. State, supra, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276, at page 1277. For that purpose the Commission obtained an allocation of $377,000 of the emergency relief funds of the State. On June 30, 1933, the United States, represented by the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, under the provisions of the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388 ), and amendatory and supplementary acts (43 U.S.C.A.  371 et seq.), made a contract with the Columbia Basin Commission by which the United States agreed to undertake topographic surveys and exploratory work and prepare certain designs and estimates for which the Columbia Basin Commission undertook to pay within the limits of its appropriation. Ryan v. State, supra, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276, at page 1278. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 193]\n\u00a0\n On November 1, 1933, the Secretary of the Interior signed a memorandum addressed to himself as Administrator of Public Works in which the Secretary recommended that the project 'be considered a federal project to be constructed, operated and maintained by the Bureau of Reclamation and to be paid for from net revenues derived from the sale of its electric power.' Under the same date, the United States, represented by the Secretary of the Interior, in pursuance of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the National Industrial Recovery Act, made a further agreement with the State of Washington providing for the expenditure by the United States, through the Bureau of Reclamation, of the sum of $63,000,000 for the construction of a dam and power plant at the Grand Coulee site, together with necessary transmission lines. There was further provision that the United States should retain title to the dam and power plant until the cost of the project, including the cost of the first unit dam and power plant, had been fully repaid into the United States Treasury; that the State Commission should act as an advisory board in conference with officers of the United States concerning the various important questions which might arise in connection with the construction and use of the dam, power plant, and transmission lines; and that the State should have an option to purchase the perpetual right to the entire power output of the first unit dam and power plant upon prescribed conditions. Ryan v. State, supra, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276, at page 1278\n\n\n On December 12, 1933, the Secretary of the Interior and Administrator of Public Works signed an amended Declaration of Taking in the case of United States v. Continental Land Company et al., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington,* in which it was stated that certain lands at the Grand Coulee Dam site to the extent of 840.28 acres 'are hereby taken for the use of the United States' in the construction of a \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n dam 'for the regulation and control of the flow of the Columbia River, for a storage reservoir from the damsite to the Canadian boundary, for the improvement of navigation, for flood control, for hydro-electric power development at the Grand Coulee damsite, for the increase of power development downstream, for the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands, for the domestic use of water, and for the relief of unemployment.' Thereupon the United States immediately acquired title and possession of the lands involved. 40 U.S.C.  258a (40 U.S.C.A.  258a). Shortly after, on January 4, 1934, the First Assistant Secretary of the Interior gave formal notice to the Commissioner of Public Lands of Washington of the intention of the United States to make examinations and surveys and attached to the notice a list of lands owned by the State 'over and upon which the United States requires rights of way for canals, ditches, laterals and sites for reservoirs and structures appurtenant thereto; and such additional rights of way and quantities of land as may be required for the operation and maintenance of the completed works for the said proposed Columbia Basin Project.' The notice was given pursuant to the state statutes to which we shall presently refer. The lands in this list are described as 'Bed and Shore Lands of Washington State' and 'Uplands of Washington State,' affected by Columbia Basin Project.\n In December, 1933, the Department of the Interior entered into a contract with David H. Ryan (No. 8) for the excavation of the 'over- burden' at the damsite. That work was upon land, above high-water mark, already or about to be acquired by the United States. The contractor completed it in the summer of 1934, maintaining his office and living quarters within the territory of the Grand Coulee Project. The contract provided that the appellant should 'obtain all required licenses and permits,' should furnish 'compensation insurance' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n in compliance with the laws of the State, and should 'comply with all applicable provisions of federal, state, and municipal safety laws and building and construction codes.' Ryan v. State, supra, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276, at page 1279.\n In July, 1934, a contract was made between the United States and Silas Mason Company and others, appellants in No. 7, for the construction of part of the Grand Coulee Dam and Power Plant covered by described items in the schedule of specifications, for the sum of $29,339,301.50.3 This contract, like that of Ryan, required the contractor to obtain licenses and permits and to furnish compensation insurance in compliance with the workmen's compensation law of the State.\n Such a vast undertaking necessarily had in view a large number of employees who with their families would require the appropriate facilities of community life. Accordingly, the specifications provided for the erection on the tract acquired by the government of a 'contractor's camp,' embracing the various buildings incident to the work and homes for the contractor's employees. The contractor was required, regardless of the approval of the contracting officer, to 'comply with all the laws and regulations of the State of Washington or any agency or subdivision thereof, which affect the building, maintenance or operation' of the camp. The discharge of sewage into the Columbia River was to conform to the laws and regulations of the Department of Health of the State. The contractor was to make all necessary arrangements with the proper state and county authorities \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 196]\n\u00a0\n for school facilities and for police protection which within 'the area involved in and surrounding the construction work' was to be furnished by the Washington State Patrol in co-operation with the Government. The contractor was also to provide and maintain jail facilities satisfactory to the Washington State Patrol and to co-operate with it and the Government in the maintenance of law and order.\n The contractor's camp has developed into a community called 'Mason City.' On the opposite side of the river lies another camp maintained by the United States for the offices and residences of its engineers. It appears that there are 'two regularly formed school districes' in the area in question, one in the 'engineers' town' and one in 'Mason City,' under the laws of the State of Washington; that in 'Mason City' the policemen employed by the contractor have been made deputy sheriffs of Okanogan County; that the attorney for the contractor has been appointed a justice of the peace, and one of the doctors in the hospital at the camp has been made a deputy coroner, in that county; that, in the fall of 1933, one who was operating a beer parlor within the part of the area which lies in Grant County without a permit from the county commissioners, was fined in a justice's court as provided in the local ordinance; that the sheriff of Grant County has been called to the dam site to investigate infractions of local law.\n In September, 1934, the Department of the Interior made a further contract with appellant Ryan for the construction of a railroad connecting with the tracks of the Northern Pacific Railway Company at Odair, Wash., and running to the site of the Grand Coulee Dam. The sole purpose of this railroad was to assist in the construction of the dam and the appurtenant works.\n By the Act of August 30, 1935, 49 Stat. 1028, 1039, 1040, the Congress 'validated and ratified' all the 'con- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 197]\n\u00a0\n tracts and agreements' which had been executed in connection with the Grand Coulee Dam.\n\n 2. \nNo question is presented as to the constitutional authority of Congress to provide for this enterprise or to acquire the lands necessary or appropriate for that purpose. There is no contention that the State may interfere with the conduct of the enterprise. The question of exclusive territorial jurisdiction is distinct. That question assumes the absence of any interference with the exercise of the functions of the Federal Government and is whether the United States has acquired exclusive legislative authority so as to debar the State from exercising any legislative authority including its taxing and police power in relation to the property and activities of individuals and corporations within the territory. The acquisition of title by the United States is not sufficient to effect that exclusion. It must appear that the State, by consent or cession, has transferred to the United States that residuum of jurisdiction which otherwise it would be free to exercise. Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, 650-652, 50 S.Ct. 455, 456; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra. See, also, Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v.

Unzeuta, \n281 \nU.S. 138, 142\n, 50 S.Ct. 284, 285.\n In this instance, the Supreme Court of Washington has held that the State has not yielded exclusive legislative authority to the Federal Government. Ryan v. State, supra. That question, however, involving the extent of the jurisdiction of the United States, is necessarily a federal question. Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 87\n, 43 S.Ct. 60, 64; United States v. Utah, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438, 440; Borax Consolidated v. Los Angeles, \n296 \nU.S. 10, 22\n, 56 S.Ct. 23, 29.\n\n 3. \nThe question arises with respect (a) to lands acquired by the United States from the State itself, (b) to lands acquired by the United States from individual owners by purchase or condemnation, (c) to Indian tribal lands. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 198]\n\u00a0\n Lands acquired from the State. These consist of the river bed and shore lands and of certain uplands including 'school lands.'\n While the United States has paramount authority over the river for the purpose of the control and improvement of navigation, the title to the river bed, as well as to the shore lands and school lands was in the State ( Port of Seattle v. Oregon & Washington R. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 41 S.Ct. 237, 239), and the State had legislative authority over all this area consistent with federal functions. United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat, 336, 386, 387; Stockton v. Baltimore & N.Y.R. Co. (C.C .) 32 F. 9, 18; Hamburg-American S.S. Co. v. Grube, \n196 \nU.S. 407, 415\n, 25 S.Ct. 352; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362, 371\n, 372 S., 32 S.Ct. 499. The notice to the state authorities by the Department of the Interior with respect to the river bed, shore lands, and uplands owned by the State was said to be given 'pursuant to the Act of Congress of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388) and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto.' 43 U.S.C.  371 et seq. (43 U.S.C.A.  371 et seq.). The notice is set forth in the margin. 4 The reference is to the United States Recla- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 199]\n\u00a0\n mation Act. That act was not intended to provide for the acquisition of exclusive federal jurisdiction. The act itself stated the contrary ( section 8, 43 U.S.C.  383). It directed the Secretary of the Interior to proceed in conformity with the state laws in carrying out the provisions of the act and provided that nothing therein contained should be construed as interfering with the laws of the State relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation. The act has been administered in harmony with this controlling principle that the State should not be ousted of jurisdiction. See Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 92\n, 93 S., 27 S.Ct. 655; Nebraska v. Wyoming, \n295 \nU.S. 40, 42\n, 55 S.Ct. 568: California Oregon Power Co. v. Beaver Cement Co., \n295 \nU.S. 142, 164\n, 55 S.Ct. 725, 731.\n The Department of the Interior expressly stated that the notice was given 'pursuant to section 3378 of Pierce's Code (1929)' with respect to examinations and surveys, and the list of state lands 'in pursuance of section 3380 of Pierce's Code (1929).' These are sections 7410 and 7412 of Remington's Revised Statutes, which with related provisions were enacted in 1905. Laws of Washington, 1905, p. 180. These provisions are set forth in the margin. \n5\n They \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 200]\n\u00a0\n were manifestly enacted to give authority to the United States to acquire property for the purposes of irrigation under the United States Reclamation Act and with the corresponding limitations. Thus section 7410 ( section 3378 of Pierce's Code) provides for notice by the Secretary of the Interior to the Commissioner of Public Lands of the State that the United States pursuant to the Reclamation Act intends to make examinations or surveys for the utilization of specified waters. And section 7412 (section 3380 of Pierce's Code) contemplates the proceeding under the Reclamation Act as described in section 7410.\n__________ public lands of this state that pursuant to the provisions of the act of congress approved June 17, 1902, entitled, 'An act appropriating the receipts from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain states and territories to the construction of irrigation works for the reclamation of arid lands,' or any amendment of said act or substitute therefor, the United States intends to make examinations or surveys for the utilization of certain specified waters, the waters so described shall not thereafter be subject to appropriation under any law of this state for a period of one year from and after the date of the receipt of such notice by such commissioner of public lands; but such notice shall not in any wise affect the appropriation of any water theretofore in good faith initiated under any law of this state, but such appropriation may be completed in accordance with the law in the same manner and to the same extent as though such notice had not been given. No adverse claim to any such waters initiated subsequent to the receipt by the commissioner of public lands of such notice shall be recognized, under the laws of this state, except as to such amount of the waters described in such notice or certificate hereinafter provided as may be formally released in writing by a duly authorized officer of the United States. If the said secretary of the interior or other duly authorized officer of the United States shall, before the expiration of said period of one year, certify in writing to the said commissioner of public lands that the project contemplated in such notice appears to be feasible and that the investigation will be made in detail, the waters specified in such notice shall not be subject to appropriation under any law of this state for the further period of three years following the date or receipt of such certificate, and such further time as the commissioner of public lands \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 201]\n\u00a0\n Section 7411 (section 3379 of Pierce's Code) refers to the same sort of proceeding. As to appropriation of water, it provides that appropriation 'by or on behalf of the\n________ may grant, upon application of the United States or some one of its authorized officers and notice thereof first published once in each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county where the works for the utilization of such waters are to be constructed, and if such works are to be in or extend into two or more counties, then for the same period in a newspaper in each of such counties: Provided, that in case such certficate shall not be filed with said commissioner of public lands within the period of one year herein limited therefor the waters specified in such notice shall, after the expiration of said period of one year, become unaffected by such notice and subject to appropriation as they would have been had such notice never been given: And provided further, that in case such certificate be filed within said one year and the United States does not authorize the construction of works for the utilization of such waters within said three years after the filing of said certificate, then the waters specified in such notice and certificate shall, after the expiration of said last named period of three years, become unaffected by such notice or certificate and subject to appropriation as they would have been had such notice never been given and such certificate never filed.'\n' 7411. Appropriation-Title to beds and shores. Whenever said secretary of the interior or other duly authorized officer of the United States shall cause to be let a contract for the construction of any irrigation works or any works for the storage of water for use in irrigation, or any portion or section thereof, for which the withdrawal has been effected as provided in section 7410, any authorized officer of the United States, either in the name of the United States or in such name as may be determined by the secretary of the interior, may appropriate, in behalf of the United States, so much of the unappropriated waters of the state as may be required for the project, or projects, for which water has been withdrawn or reserved under the preceding section of this act, including any and all divisions thereof, theretofore constructed, in whole or in part, by the United States or proposed to be thereafter constructed by the United States, such appropriation to be made, maintained and perfected in the same manner and to the same extent as though such appropriation had been made by a private person, corporation or association, except that \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 202]\n\u00a0\n United States shall inure to the United States, and its successors in interest, in the same manner and to the same extent as though said appropriation had been made\n\n__________ the date of priority as to all rights under such appropriation in behalf of the United States shall relate back to the date of the first withdrawal or reservation of the waters so appropriated, and in case of filings on water previously withdrawn under said section 7410, no payment of fees will be required. Such appropriation by or on behalf of the United States shall inure to the United States, and its successors in interest, in the same manner and to the same extent as though said appropriation had been made by a private person, corporation or association. The title to the beds and shores of any navigable lake or stream utilized by the construction of any reservoir or other irrigation works created or constructed as a part of such appropriation hereinbefore in this section provided for, shall vest in the United States to the extent necessary for the maintenance, operation and control of such reservoir or other irrigation works.'\n' 7412. Reservation of necessary lands by United States-Procedure. When the notice provided for in section 7410 shall be given to the commissioner of public lands the proper officers of the United States may file with the said commissioner a list of lands (including in the term 'lands' as here used, the beds and shores of any lake, river, stream, or other waters) owned by the state, over or upon which the United States may require rights of way for canals, ditches or laterals or sites for reservoirs and structures therefor or appurtenant thereto, or such additional rights of way and quantity of land as may be required for the operation and maintenance of the completed works for the irrigation project contemplated in such notice, and the filing of such list shall constitute a reservation from the sale or other disposal by the state of such lands so described, which reservation shall, upon the completion of such works and upon the United States by its proper officers filing with the commissioner of public lands of the state a description of such lands by metes and bounds or other definite description, ripen into a grant from the state to the United States. The state, in the disposal of lands granted from the United States to the state, shall reserve for the United States rights of way for ditches, canals, laterals, telephone and transmission lines which may be required by the United States for the construction, operation and maintenance of irrigation works.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 203]\n\u00a0\n by a private person, corporation or association.' As to acquisition of title by the United States, it provides:\n\n'The title to the beds and shores of any navigable lake or stream utilized by the construction of any reservoir or other irrigation works created or constructed as a part of such appropriation hereinbefore in this section provided for, shall vest in the United States to the extent necessary for the maintenance, operation and control of such reservoir or other irrigation works.'\n\n Neither in the statutes governing the proceeding initiated by the Secretary of the Interior nor in the state statute was there provision for acquisition by the United States of exclusive legislative authority over the lands of the State to which title was thus obtained. This is true with respect to all the lands mentioned in the Secretary's notice embracing the bed of the river, the shore lands, and the designated uplands including school lands.\n Lands acquired by purchase or condemnation. Appellants contend that exclusive jurisdiction as to these lands vested ipso facto in the Federal Government by the operation of clause 17, section 8, article 1, of the Federal Constitution, which provides that the Congress shall have power 'To exercise exclusive Legislation' over 'all Places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.' Considering this provision in James v. Dravo Contracting Company, supra, we construed the phrase 'other needful Buildings' to embrace locks and dams and whatever structures are found to be necessary in the performance of the functions of the Federal Government. We also concluded that clause 17 should not be construed as implying a stipulation that the consent of the State to purchases must be without reservations. We were unable to reconcile such an implication with the freedom of the State and its \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 204]\n\u00a0\n admitted authority to refuse or qualify cessions of jurisdiction when purchases have been made without consent or property has been acquired by condemnation.\n The statute of Washington which is relied upon as granting consent and ceding exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal Government is section 8108 of Remington's Revised Statutes, the full text of which is quoted in the margin. 6 This statute gives consent to the acquisition of lands by the United States 'for the sites of locks, dams, piers, breakwaters, keepers' dwellings, and other necessary structures and purposes required in the improvement of the rivers and harbors of this state, or bordering thereon, or for the sites of forts, magazines, arsenals, docks, navy-yards, naval stations, or other needful buildings authorized by any act of congress.' The consent is said to be given in accordance with the constitutional provision found in clause 17 of section 8 of article 1 and with the acts of Congress in such cases made and provided. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 205]\n\u00a0\n The statute in terms refers to such acquisition 'from any individual or individuals, bodies politic or corporate, within the boundaries or limits of this state.' This language is not apt to describe acquisitions from the State itself. And many years ago (1903) the Supreme Court of the State so held with respect to the corresponding provisions of the Acts of 1890, p. 459, and 1891, p. 31, embodied in section 8108. State ex rel. Bussell v. Callvert, 33 Wash. 380, 388-390, 74 P. 573. Under that construction, the above-quoted provisions of section 8108 would be inapplicable to the acquisition of title to the river bed, shore lands, and uplands owned by the State, apart from our conclusions in the light of the proceedings taken under the United States Reclamation Act and the pertinent state statute.\n With respect to lands acquired from private owners, the Supreme Court of the State has held in the instant case that the enterprise of the Federal Government has a reach which takes it outside the purview of section 8108. The pith of the decision is that, while the statute contemplated the building of locks and dams and other struc- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 206]\n\u00a0\n tures required in the improvement of the rivers and harbors of the State, it did not contemplate the yielding by the State of all legislative authority in connection with such a project as the Columbia Basin Project embracing 'the development of irrigation and of power for industrial purposes.' The state court concluded 'that the purposes of the project, taken as a whole, do not fall exclusively within any of the enumerated classes mentioned above (in the statute), so as to give the United States exclusive jurisdiction over the lands, but, rather in a class where several purposes are so intermingled as to call for the exercise of jurisdiction by both the federal government and the state, according as their respective interests and duties require.' Ryan v. State, supra, 188 Wash. 115, 61 P.2d 1276, at page 1284.\n Considering the scope of the federal undertaking, we cannot say that this construction of section 8108 is inadmissible. Thus irrigation-'the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands'-is an integral part of the federal plan and the reservoirs for the storage of water were to be provided with that end in view. That was set forth as one of the main objectives, as well as the development of power, in the Declaration of Taking filed in the federal court in the condemnation proceedings, and, whatever may be said of power development so far as it is incidental to the improvement of navigation, the reclamation of arid or semiarid lands has always been regarded as a project which carried with it an appropriate recognition of a continued state jurisdiction. Kansas v. Colorado, supra; Nebraska v. Wyoming, supra. We cannot say that the state statute, enacted in 1891, must be taken as conclusively showing an intent to yield exclusive jurisdiction in such a case. Assuming that because of the presence of the federal question we are at liberty to construe the statute for ourselves, we should, in harmony with our principles of decision in such cases, give great weight to the views of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 207]\n\u00a0\n the state court as to the intent and limitations of the state statute in granting consent and cession. See Freeport Water Company v. Freeport, \n180 \nU.S. 587, 595\n, 596 S., 21 S.Ct. 493; Milwaukee Electric R. & L. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n238 \nU.S. 174, 184\n, 35 S.Ct. 820; Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319, 322\n, 57 S.Ct. 483, 484; Dodge v. Board of Education, \n302 \nU.S. 74\n, 58 S.Ct. 98, decided November 8, 1937. We should accept that construction unless we are satisfied that it does violence to federal right based upon the statute, defeating the reasonable anticipation and purpose of securing through the operation of the statute an essential and exclusive legislative authority for the Federal Government.\n Not only do we find no violence done to federal right or frustration of federal intent by the State's construction of its statute, but the evidence is clear that the Federal Government contemplated the continued existence of state jurisdiction consistent with federal functions and invited the cooperation of the State in providing an appropriate exercise of local authority over the territory.\n Even if it were assumed that the state statute should be construed to apply to the federal acquisitions here involved, we should still be met by the contention of the Government that it was not compelled to accept, and has not accepted, a transfer of exclusive jurisdiction. As such a transfer rests upon a grant by the State, through consent or cession, it follows, in accordance with familiar principles applicable to grants, that the grant may be accepted or declined. Acceptance may be presumed in the absence of evidence of a contrary intent, but we know of no constitutional principle which compels acceptance by the United States of an exclusive jurisdiction contrary to its own conception of its interests. The mere fact that the Government needs title to property within the boundaries of a State, which may be acquired irrespective of the consent of the State ( Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 372 S.), does not necessitate the assumption by the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 208]\n\u00a0\n Government of the burdens incident to an exclusive jurisdiction. We have frequently said that our system of government is a practical adjustment by which the national authority may be maintained in its full scope without unnecessary loss of local efficiency. In acquiring property, the federal function in view may be performed without disturbing the local administration in matters which may still appropriately pertain to state authority. In our opinion in James v. Dravo Contracting Company, supra, we observed that the possible importance of reserving to the State jurisdiction for local purposes which involve no interference with the performance of governmental functions is becoming more and more clear as the activities of the Government expand and large areas within the States are acquired. And we added that there appeared to be no reason why the United States should be compelled to accept exclusive jurisdiction or the State be compelled to grant it in giving its consent to purchases.\n The federal intent in this instance is clearly shown. It is shown not merely by the action of administrative officials, but by the deliberate and ratifying action of Congress, which gives the force of law to the prior official action even if unauthorized when taken. Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd., v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297, 301\n, 302 S., 57 S.Ct. 478, 479. As Congress validated and ratified 'all contracts' which have been executed in connection with the Grand Coulee Dam project, we are at liberty to refer to the terms of these contracts as manifesting the intention of Congress no less than that of the officers who executed them. These contracts with appellants were made in full appreciation of the inevitable creation, through the carrying out of this project, of a large local community within the area acquired by the United States, with residents whose needs could be suitably served by the administration of the laws of the State without interfering in any way with the execution of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 209]\n\u00a0\n federal plan. School facilities were to be, and have been, provided by arrangements with the local authorities. Police protection was to be, and has been, assured by co-operation with the State Patrol. Cognizance of crimes committed within the area has been taken by local prosecutors and judicial officers. It is futile to say that these local authorities became federal authorities pro hac vice, for the contracts which have been ratified by Congress manifestly contemplated action by the local officers as representatives of the State and as acting in the exercise of state jurisdiction.\n In particular, appellants' contracts assumed that state jurisdiction would extend to activities of the contractors. They were to obtain all required licenses and permits. Compensation insurance under the laws of the State was to be provided for their employees. State building regulations were to be obeyed. The rules of the local Department of Health were to be observed in the discharge of sewage into the river. We are at a loss to understand how the continued jurisdiction of the State without conflicting with federal operations could have been more fully recognized, or the assumption of exclusive legislative authority by the United States more effectively disclaimed, than by the action of Congress in ratifying the provisions of these contracts.\n Appellants' argument comes to this-that we must not only override the construction of the state statute by the state court but that we must construe the statute as compelling the Federal Government to assume an exclusive legislative authority which it did not need, which it has not accepted or exercised, and against the burden of which it has sought to protect itself by securing state cooperation in accordance with the express authorization of Congress. We find no warrant for such action.\n Indian tribal lands. What has been said also disposes of the contention in relation to this part of the area. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 186, 210]\n\u00a0\n Appellants say that title was originally in the United States for the benefit of Indians on the Colville Reservation. Executive Order of July 2, 1872. While at a later date the lands were opened for entry (Act March 22, 1906, 34 Stat. 80; Proclamation of the President, May 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 1778), it appears that they were withdrawn before any entry was made. Appellants concede that title to these lands has always been in the United States and hence could not have been acquired by purchase or condemnation. But with respect to such lands exclusive legislative authority would be obtained by the United States only through cession by the State. Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 647\n, at page 651, 50 S.Ct. 455, 456. If they may be deemed to be within the reference in section 8108 to 'public land' which 'may be set apart by the general government' for the purposes 'before mentioned,' we are brought back to the questions already discussed, and we need not consider the question whether these lands had in fact been set apart in the prescribed manner.\n Our conclusion is that the State had territorial jurisdiction to impose the tax upon appellants' receipts and that the tax does not lay an unconstitutional burden upon the Federal Government.\n The respective judgments are affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in James v. Dravo Contracting Company, supra. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act describes the tax as laid 'upon the privilege of engaging in business activities.'

Co. and another.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases involve the validity of the Smith patent No. 1,262,860, of April 16, 1918, and more particularly the question whether Smith was anticipated by the prior use of the patented invention by Hastings. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n In Smith v. Snow (1935) \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 279, we held the patent valid and infringed. But in that case the Hastings prior use was not presented or considered. At that time the present infringement suits brought by petitioner against respondents Hall and James were pending in the District Courts for Connecticut and for Western New York, respectively. In view of the definition given to the patent by our decision, the Hastings defense assumed an importance in these suits apparently not attributed to it in earlier litigation, and it has been developed in the records now before us more fully than in any earlier case. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The decrees of the District Courts rejecting the defense were reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Smith v. Hall, 83 F.(2d) 217, Smith v. James Mfg. Co., 83 F.(2d) 221, which found prior use by Hastings. We brought the cases here on certiorari, \n298 \nU.S. 652\n, 56 S. Ct. 947, to resolve the conflict in the result of the decisions below with that of our decision in Smith v. Snow, supra. The two suits came to the court below, as they do here, upon different records. The court treated the cases as though the two records constituted a joint record applicable to both cases, and petitioner presents the cases here jointly. See Butler v.

Allen, \n286 \nU.S. 191, 198\n, 199 S., 52 S.Ct. 532, 533, 81 A.L.R. 703.\n The Hall suit is for an infringement of claim 1 of the patent, and the James suit for infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, and 5. Claims 1, 2, and 3 are claims for a method of incubation of a plurality of eggs. Claim 5 is a claim for an apparatus adapted to the use of the method and is of significance in the present litigation only if a method claims is sustained. Claim 1 may be taken as typical of the other method claims. In Smith v. Snow, supra, its essential elements were stated to be (\n294 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 8, 55 S.Ct. 279, 282):\n'(a) The arrangement of the eggs at different levels in staged incubation in a closed chamber, having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape of foul air without undue loss of moisture; (b) the application to the eggs of heated air in a current created by means other than variation of temperature; and (c) as marking the boundaries of the claim, the current of air is to be of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse, and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature whereby the air will be vitalized, moisture conserved, and the units of heat carried from the eggs in the more advanced stage to those in the less advanced.'\n\n Staged incubation is the successive setting of eggs in the same incubator at brief intervals. At different stages in the course of the three-week period of incubation the eggs have different temperatures, those in the earlier having lower temperatures than those in the later stages. When subjected to a temperature approximating that of body heat, the eggs of the earlier stages absorb heat and those of the later stages give off heat. It was pointed out in the opinion in the Snow Case that a demonstrated advantage of the Smith method over that of the earlier type of incubator, in which there was no propelled current of air, is that it facilitates the continuous operation \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n of the incubator through staged incubation, and makes it possible in the process of incubation to increase the number of eggs in a single incubator from a few hundred to many thousands.\n To avoid infringement, it was insisted in the Snow Case that the claim was restricted, by the specifications and drawings of the patent, to use of the method in an apparatus by which the propelled current of heated air was first brought in contact with the more advanced eggs. In rejecting that contention, the opinion pointed out hat neither the claim itself, construed in he light of the specifications, nor the successful operation of the method, required the arrangement of the eggs in any particuar order; that the continuous circulation of air of appropriate temperature in a closed chamber, called for by the claim, served to equalize the temperature at the desired degree by carrying heat units from the more advanced eggs of high temperature to the less advanced eggs of lower temperature, regardless of the particular order in which it passed the eggs of different stages. We said (\n294 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 14, 55 S.Ct. 279, 284): 'the claim does not call for a particular order or arrangement of the eggs in staged incubation in the incubator, or that the propelled current should reach them in any particular order, or that it should be guided, controlled, or directed by any particular means, or in any particular manner other than that it should be of sufficient velocity to produce the results prescribed by the claim.'\n Thus construed, infringement of the patented method could not be avoided nor anticipation of it denied by showing that the challenged use was with different arrangements of the eggs or with a different structure, for guiding or controlling the propelled current of air within the closed chamber, from any exhibited in the specifications and drawings of the patent. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n To establish the Hastings prior use respondents rely on the proof of his construction of an incubator in Brooklyn, N.Y., early in 1911, and its use in the hatching season in the early months of that year and of 1912, and on proof of his construction of another in Muskogee, Okl., in 1911, and its use in 1912 and 1913. They offer documentary corroboration in more or less contemporary articles in published journals and in a patent application with its supporting documents, filed in the patent office in 1911\n\n\n Without stopping to state the evidence in detail, it is established by the testimony of Hastings, abundantly corroborated, and not seriously denied, that, apart from the setting of eggs in staged incubation, which will be presently discussed, these incubators employed all the elements of the Smith method, and that their operation was successful in the sense that they were each used for hatching eggs for two successive seasons and that the percentage of the hatches was comparable to that of the smaller still air incubators then in use. Hastings' incubators were closed chambers, with restricted openings. A current of heated air was propelled by a motor driven fan in such manner as to come in contact with the eggs placed within the chamber in stacks of trays, and to return to the fan by means of which it was continuously recirculated. See Smith v. Snow, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 20 S., 55, S.Ct. 279, 286, 287; Waxham v. Smith, \n294 \nU.S. 20, 22\n, 55 S.Ct. 277, 278. Both incubators were of large capacity. That in Brooklyn was built for 6,000 eggs, although it does not appear that it ever contained more than 2,000 eggs at any one time, and that in Muskogee was for 30,000 eggs. It is plain that Hastings built and operated incubators suitable for the use of the Smith method, but petitioner sharply challenges the contention that he did use that method in either of them. It is said that there is no convincing proof that eggs were ever placed in the Brooklyn incubator in staged incuba- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n tion, and that the structure of the other and the manner of its use were such as to show that the Smith method as we have described it was the employed. These are the crucial issues.\n Hastings built and operated the Brooklyn incubator for Davis, who conducted a poultry farm as the means of supplying chickens for a restaurant which he also operated. After Hastings left Davis' employ in May, 1911, the latter operated the incubator during the season of 1912. Subsequently he went out of the poultry business and dismantled the incubator. Hastings testified, specifically and in detail, that the eggs were placed in the Brooklyn incubator in staged incubation. Davis, corroborated to some extent by his wife, testified that the eggs were placed in the incubator at twice a week intervals, when they were delivered, at the rate of one or two crates a week, by the poultryman from whom they were purchased. The eggs were placed in trays in the incubator chamber where they were exposed to a current of heated air under thermostatic control. The air, maintained at a practically uniform temperature, was continuously circulated throughout the chamber by means of an electric fan. This oral testimony, if taken at its face value, would show that the Smith method was used in the Brooklyn incubator with eggs in staged incubation. But without corroboration, it is insufficient to establish prior use. The Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 12 S.Ct. 443, 450; Deering v. Winona Harvester Works, \n155 \nU.S. 286, 300\n, 15 S.Ct. 118; Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., \n261 \nU.S. 45, 60\n, 43 S.Ct. 322, 327, and we turn to the documentary evidence that Hastings knew the method of the patent and used it in his Brooklyn structure.\n Before 1908 Hastings had had an extensive experience in poultry culture. In 1908 and 1909 he was in the service of the Department of Agriculture, and in the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n course of his duties he inspected many poultry plants and experimental stations operating incubators. He was the author of a book, 'The Dollar Hen,' published in 1909, in which he described a procedure for the incubation of eggs. It spoke of an incubator in which 'At hatching times the eggs are spread out in trays in a special hatching room, which is only large enough to accommodate chicks in the amount of one-sixth of the incubator capacity, for twice a week delivering or one-third if weekly deliveries are desired.' It also described an incubator in which 'All temperature regulation is by means of air heated (or cooled as the case may be) outside of the egg rooms and forced in to the egg rooms by a motor driven cone fan, maintaining a steady current of air, the rate of movement of which may be varied at will. The air movement maintained will always be sufficiently brisk, however, to prevent an uneveness (sic) of temperature in different parts of the room.' The reference to an incubator in continuous operation, for deliveries once or twice a week, and to temperature regulation of the egg chamber by a propelled current of heated air, moving at a velocity sufficient to maintain an even temperature, shows that Hastings had the conception of staged incubation long before he built the Brooklyn incubator.\n On May 3, 1911, while he was in Davis' employ, and when the Brooklyn incubator was in operation, Hastings filed an application for a patent, Serial No. 624,885. Documents in support of the application filed as late as July 1911, give Hastings' address as that of Davis in Brooklyn. The application discloses a chamber with restricted openings in which the eggs are placed and through which a steady current of air heated to a uniform temperature, is propelled by a constantly moving electric fan, so as to circulate throughout the chamber. Although the application taught the use of fabric or per- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n forated partitions for the purpose of causing an even distribution of the current of air, it specified that the invention was 'not limited to any particular circulation or movement of the air and by the use of the fan the gravity drafts may be overcome and the air caused to move in any desired direction.' The application was prepared by Hastings, but upon its rejection by the examiner, he sought the aid of counsel who, on May 24, 1912, amended the claim and filed a statement in explanation of it, stating that they had derived data and information from a practical hatchery of large capacity then being operated by the applicant.\n In this statement it was pointed out that 'the temperature of the eggs themselves varies in accordance with the stage of their development and the gaseous emanations tend to produce vitiated conditions which exert a marked influence upon the eggs themselves and especially upon the adjacent eggs, if the eggs are at different stages of their development'; that 'in a large hatchery where many hundreds and even thousands of eggs are being continually advanced in the process of incubation the ordinary means for causing the circulation of air by convexion currents through and in the incubating chamber has been demonstrated as being totally inadequate, and this is believed to be one of the principal reasons why, up to the present time, hatcheries of large capacity have proven to be practical failures.' And finally it was stated that Hastings had 'discovered that the temperature and gaseous stratification in the incubating chamber must be overcome by a mechanically forced circulation of the air which will insure a correct and uniform influence of the air upon all of the eggs in the incubating chamber, and this forced circulation must be such as to overcome the counteracting influence of the eggs upon the air when said eggs are in the different stages of incubation.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n In the brief of counsel on appeal to the Board of Examiners-in-Chief, dated December 30, 1912, these points were elaborated and explained. It was stated: 'The problem has been to enable the incubating operations to be carried on continuously, if so desired, with eggs at all stages of development, and with all of a vast number of eggs subjected to the same temperature and atmospheric conditions best adapted for the development of the embryo.' It was pointed out that 'during the initial stage of incubation the eggs absorb heat whereby their temperature is raised, but during the final stages the vital processes generate heat, and in practice it is found that with vast numbers of eggs assembled in a single compartment and with eggs at all stages of incubation but very little extraneous heat need be supplied, because the eggs, in the later stages of development supply the necessary heat for the eggs in the earlier stages of development. In practice, however, a source of heat is always maintained in order to permit of proper regulation.'\n It was then explained that the 'temperature stratification in the egg chamber' is overcome 'through the provision of a mechanically operated air forcing means which would force a rapid circulation of air through the whole collection of eggs in the chamber and past the heater. The mechanical air forcing means is an essential factor, if heat is to be conserved and the conditions maintained uniform.' And later it was said: 'It is through the instrumentality of these elements that the temperature and gaseous stratification of the air in the chamber is overcome and the eggs are uniformly subjected to the influence of air of the same temperature and composition.'\n The brief also quoted from a statement of Hastings, which, after observing that temperature stratification may be overcome in a hatching chamber holding many \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 226]\n\u00a0\n thousands of eggs by applying to them a mechanically impelled blast of air, says:\n'In the Hastings hatchery, a current of air is blown past each and every egg at the rate of thirty feet per minute and this rapidly moving air quickly bringing the temperature of the egg to approximately that of the air. This method of heating keeps the temperature of the eggs in the advanced state of incubation down within a few degrees of that of the air, the exact difference being regulated at will by adjusting the speed of the fan. When properly adjusted the same blast of air used to heat fresh eggs does equally well for eggs in the advanced stages just as the same temperature of the body of the hen incubates the eggs at all stages of development, without recourse on the hen's part to the 'hatching fever', erroneously supposed to explain the high temperature of eggs at a more advanced stage of development. Owing to this fact eggs at all stages may be handled simultaneously with uniformly good results.'\n\n He also mentioned the introduction of moisture into the current of air by the use of a spray or the introduction of outside air at the fan.\n We think it plain that at the time these documents were filed the essential elements for hatching eggs in staged incubation, as they were later claimed in the Smith patent, were known to Hastings, and that he was familiar with a structure capable of employing that method. They afford convincing corroboration of the oral testimony that the incubator in use in Brooklyn immediately preceding the filing of the application, and both incubators in use during its pendency, employed the method of the Smith claim. Whether Hastings knew fully and precisely the scientific principles involved in the procedure thus outlined is immaterial. It is enough if he knew and used the method with operative \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 227]\n\u00a0\n success. De Forest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., \n283 \nU.S. 664, 686\n, 51 S.Ct. 563, 569. He did know the method of setting eggs in staged incubation in a closed chamber and continuously circulating through them a current of moistened air at an appropriate temperature, and he knew that the advantages of the use of this method over the type of incubator in which there were no mechanically propelled currents of air, were that it facilitated the continuous operation of the incubator and the simultaneous incubation in a single chamber of a greatly increased number of eggs.\n The disclosures made in the Hastings brief were so complete that they might well have been used in support of the Smith claim. Pressed to their conclusion, they would have warranted award of the patent later granted to Smith. See Smith v. Snow, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 14-16, 55 S.Ct. 279, 284, 285. While the Patent Office file on the abandoned claim is not relied on as a prior publication, see The Corn Planter Patent, 23 Wall. 181, 210, 211; cf. Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis- Bournonville Co., \n270 \nU.S. 390, 400\n, 402 S., 46 S.Ct. 324, 325, it is competent and cogent evidence to determine the nature and date of the invention which the inventor claims to have embodied in working form, see The Corn Planter Patent, supra, 23 Wall. 181, 211; United States Blind Stitch Mach. Corporation v. Reliable Mach. Works, Inc., 67 F.(2d) 327, 328 (C.C.A.2d); Walker, Patents (6th Ed., 1929),  97, 98.\n In 1911, Hastings induced Lieber, a local lawyer and business man of Muskogee, Okl., and another, to organize a corporation for the promotion of the Hastings method of incubation. Under its auspices Hastings constructed there an incubator of 30,000-egg capacity in the latter part of 1911 and directed its operation during the 1912 hatching season. Its operation was continued by an associate in the season of 1913. The general plan of its construction and mechanical operation as testified to by \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 228]\n\u00a0\n Hastings is abundantly corroborated by disinterested witnesses and contemporary photographs and publications describing it. The principal witnesses are Lieber, who furnished the money for the enterprise, Peabody, the electrical contractor who installed the fan and other electrical equipment of the incubator, and Hickox, manager of the local electric light company which supplied the current for the incubator. In 1912, Hickox took photographs of the incubator in operation, and prepared a written description of it. These were produced at the trial.\n The uncontradicted evidence is that the incubator consisted of a large room in which there were a series of stacks of egg trays with wire mesh bottoms. Each stack, having a capacity of 5,000 eggs, was placed in a separate compartment. There was a corridor in front of the trays, giving access to the stacks, which, in operation, were closed on the corridor side by removable shutters. A motor-driven fan, placed at one end of the incubator, propelled a current of air over a moisture pan, thence through a passage at the back of the egg trays into contact with a heating pipe under thermostatic control. From that point it passed into a passageway directly above the stacks of egg trays, thence downward through the trays to a passage beneath them, through which the current was returned to the fan in continuous circulation. A number of other witnesses, having no connection with the Hastings enterprise, including three called by petitioner, saw the incubator in operation and corroborate the testimony as to its main features; the presence within the incubator of thousands of eggs, placed in stacks or trays, hatched by the circulation through them of a fan-propelled heated current of air.\n An article giving some account of the Hastings incubator, prepared by an editor of Poultry Culture and published in that journal for February, 1912, mentions the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 229]\n\u00a0\n use of two flumes carrying the current of air from the fan, only one of which brought the air into contact with the heater. It speaks of a use of a means for controlling temperature of the air passing to each egg compartment, by mixing in proper proportions the flow of air from the two flumes. The existence of such a double conduit is not corroborated by any witness or any document, and is explicitly denied by Lieber, testifying in behalf of petitioner in the Snow Case, made a part of the present record, and by Hastings. Peabody, who installed the electrical equipment, and Hickox, who prepared a contemporary written description of the incubator, make no mention of it. Drawings showing a single passageway carrying the current of air to the egg stacks were identified as accurate by Hastings, Lieber, and Peabody. We conclude that, whatever experimental proposals or installations may have been made, the incubator was used with a single air passage above the egg compartments.\n All the witnesses agree that the incubator was commercially operated during the hatching seasons of 1912 and 1913, and that it hatched different batches of eggs placed in it with varying success. The hatches of the eggs furnished by some customers were failures. Others were successful. One of petitioner's witnesses testified that the hatches never exceeded 50 per cent. Lieber estimated that 50 per cent. was the average, with some people getting none and others getting 80 per cent. Hastings, who in the Canadian suit testified that the average was 40 per cent., stated that some settings ran up to 70 per cent. There is no testimony of any mechanical failure of the incubator after the initial trials of it, as a result of which an electric blower was substituted for the fan of lesser power. In 1912, Hastings departed for Texas, where he started another incubator. After operating the incubator through another hatching season, Lieber, his financial backer, abandoned the enterprise. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 230]\n\u00a0\n As with the Brooklyn incubator, the critical issue is whether that in Muskogee was used with eggs in staged incubation in the manner of the Smith claim. It is established beyond doubt that eggs in different stages were in process of incubation there at the same time. The incubator was used in large measure for 'custom hatching.' At frequent intervals, patrons brought their eggs in relatively small quantities to be placed in the incubator for hatching, and received at the end of the hatching period their share of the newly hatched chicks.\n The testimony of Hastings that staged incubation was employed in the Muskogee structure is corroborated by this course of business and by the contemporaneous statements and brief filed with his patent application. He testified that eggs of different stages were sometimes, though not always, placed in the same compartment of the incubator. The Poultry Culture article of February, 1912, states, after describing the use of the fan- propelled current of heated air in the incubator: 'Eggs at all stages can be placed in the same trays of the Hastings hatchery, with little or no injury. Mr. Hastings hatched several thousand eggs under such conditions in his Brooklyn plant last year.'\n Petitioner stresses the point that in the Muskogee incubator, the stacks of egg trays were concededly placed in separate compartments, with openings at the top having slide doors which could be used like a valve for regulating the volume of air flowing into each compartment. Hastings testified that the slide doors were used to cut down the supply of air when there were few or no eggs in a compartment and that they were left open when the compartment was substantially full of eggs. Petitioner points to this and to some testimony by Hastings and Lieber that the slide doors could be used to regulate the temperature in each compartment through control of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 231]\n\u00a0\n volume of air passing through them, and to testimony by Lieber that the eggs, as received, were first placed in one compartment and then at intervals, as other eggs came in, were moved from one compartment to another, and that the doors were used to control variations of temperature in the different compartments.\n From this the inference is drawn that only eggs of the same stage were placed in any one compartment, and from the inference it is argued that they were not set in staged incubation. But even if the inference is correct, it establishes only that a special method or device to guide and control the air current was used, not that staged incubation was wanting. The presence or absence of a device for controlling the current of air within the incubator is no part of the Smith claim. Our opinions in Smith v. Snow, supra, and Waxham v. Smith, supra, were careful to point out that infringement of the method could not be avoided by using it in conjunction with such a device. The presence of the device in the Muskogee incubator did not foreclose anticipation if the method was used. Since the circulating current of air passed repeatedly into the compartments in the Muskogee structure and came in contact with the heating pipe and with the eggs in the several stacks of trays, the tendency of the operation was to equalize the temperature and to carry heat units from the more advanced to the less advanced eggs. This is the method of the patent and it was employed in the Muskogee structure whether the trays of eggs of different stages were placed in the same or different compartments.\n The patent was sustained in the Snow and Waxham Cases, supra, only by establishing that neither the arrangement of the eggs, nor the particular order in which the propelled current should reach the eggs, nor the manner in which it was guided or controlled, is part of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 232]\n\u00a0\n patent claimed. It was this construction of the claim which gave a new significance to the Hastings incubators, different from any recognized by previous decisions. The petitioner, having sought and obtained a broad construction of his claim, cannot now narrow it so as to avoid anticipation by showing that the claimed method was used in a particular form of structure not claimed. It was the method thus defined which Hastings used, regardless of the particular structure which he devised to guide and control the current of air in his incubator, or the order in which it came into contact with the heater and eggs of different stages. It is immaterial that his structure for using the method was neither the best possible nor as skillfully designed or used as that later employed by Smith. Pickering v. McCullough, \n104 \nU.S. 310\n, 319; cf. Telephone Cases, \n126 \nU.S. 1, 531\n, 536 S., 8 S.Ct. 778.\n In view of this conclusion it is unimportant whether Hastings used the method in his Brooklyn incubator. But we think the testimony of its use there is sufficiently corroborated. His statement in 'The Dollar Hen,' already quoted, published before the Brooklyn structure was erected, shows clearly that he contemplated the continuous operation of an incubator with the eggs set in staged incubation so that they would be hatched for deliveries once or twice a week, by a procedure substantially that of the Smith claim. The circumstances attending the Brooklyn use, which called for the setting of eggs at frequent intervals in an incubator of large capacity, the structure exhibited in Hastings' patent application, the subsequent course of the application in the Patent Office, and finally the renewed effort at Muskogee embodying the same principles, although with an immaterial variation in structure, and the fact that both incubators functioned, are convincing evidence that Hastings knew and used in appropriate combination, both in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 216, 233]\n\u00a0\n Brooklyn and in Muskogee, the essential elements of the Smith claim. They support the heavy burden of persuasion which rests upon one who seeks to negative novelty in a patent by showing prior use. See Radio Corporation of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, \n293 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 55 S.Ct. 928, 930, and cases cited.\n Petitioner urges, and we have considered, numerous other objections to the sufficiency of proof of the Hastings prior use. The only one calling for any comment is the suggestion that the Brooklyn and Muskogee enterprises were not commercially successful. Commercial success may turn the scale when invention is in doubt, Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, \n294 \nU.S. 464, 474\n, 55 S.Ct. 449, 453; De Forest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., supra, \n283 \nU.S. 664, 685\n, 51 S.Ct. 563, 569, and the want of it may, in some circumstances, be evidence of want of operative success. But here Hastings by the use of a method which we have sustained as an invention, Smith v. Snow, supra, has attained the particular results described by the patent. He knew the method and used it in a device capable of employing it. In such circumstances, want of commercial success, which the record suggests may have been due to lack of technical and business skill, is not an indication that there was no prior use.\n Upon the records now before us we must conclude, as did the Supreme Court of Canada upon a similar record (footnote 1, supra), that Hastings antedated Smith. The Smith method was 'known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery thereof.' 35 U.S.C.  31 (35 U. S.C.A.  31).\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Before the decision in Smith v.

The bond was issued pursuant to the Act of April 24, 1917 (40 Stat. 35), and Treasury Department Circular No. 78, dated May 14, 1917, and was purchased by petitioner in December, 1934, for $10,362.50 and accrued interest. Its provisions, so far as material, read as follows: 'The United States of America for value received promises to pay to the bearer the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars on the 15th day of June, 1947, with interest at the rate of three and one-half per centum per annum payable semi-annually on December 15 and June 15 in each year until the principal hereof shall be payable, upon presentation and surrender of the interest coupons hereto attached as they severally mature. The principal and interest of this bond shall be payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value, ... All or any of the bonds of the series of which this is one may be redeemed and paid at the pleasure of the United States on or after June 15, 1932, or on any semi-annual interest payment date or dates, at the face value thereof and interest accrued at the date of redemption, on notice published at least three months prior to the redemption date, and published thereafter from time to time during said three months period as the Secretary of the Treasury shall direct. ... From the date of redemption designated in any such notice interest on the bonds called for redemption shall cease, and all coupons thereon maturing after said date shall be void. ...'\n On March 14, 1935, the Secretary of the Treasury published a notice of call for the redemption on June 15, 1935, of all the bonds so issued.\n'Public notice is hereby given:\n\n'1. All outstanding First Liberty Loan bonds of 1932-47 and hereby called for redemption on June 15, 1935. The \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 350]\n\u00a0\n various issues of First Liberty Loan bonds (all of which are included in this call) are as follows:\n\n'First Liberty Loan 3 1\/2 percent bonds of 1932-47 (First 3 1\/2's), dated June 15, 1917; ...\n\n'2. Interest on all such outstanding First Liberty Loan bonds will cease on said redemption date, June 15, 1935.'\n\n Thereafter, on April 22, 1935, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a circular (Department Circular, No. 535) prescribing rules for the redemption of First Liberty Loan bonds, and providing, among other things, as follows: 'Holders of any outstanding First Liberty Loan bonds will be entitled to have such bonds redeemed and paid at par on June 15, 1935, with interest in full to that date. After June 15, 1935, interest will not accrue on any First Liberty Loan bonds.'\n Nearly two years before the publication of the notice of call Congress had adopted the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933 (48 Stat. 112, 31 U.S.C.A.  462, 463), by which every obligation purporting to be payable in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby was to be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment was legal tender for public and private debts. Nearly four weeks before the publication of the notice of call, the validity of that Joint Resolution had been the subject of adjudication by this court in the Gold Clause Cases, Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 55 S. Ct. 407, 95 A.L.R. 1352, Nortz v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 317\n, 55 S.Ct. 428, 95 A.L.R. 1346, and Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 95 A.L.R. 1335, all decided February 18, 1935. We may presume that the call was issued with knowledge of those rulings.\n About six months after the date designated for redemption, petitioner, on December 28, 1935, presented his bond (with coupons due on and before June 15, 1935, detached) to the Treasurer of the United States, and demanded the redemption by the payment of 10,000 gold dollars each \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 351]\n\u00a0\n containing 25.8 grains of gold nine-tenths fine, which was the gold content of a dollar in 1917. The Treasurer refused to comply with that demand, but offered payment of the face amount of the principal in legal tender coin or currency other than gold or gold certificates. Petitioner declined to accept the tender and retained the bond. Thereafter, on the same day, petitioner presented to the Treasurer of the United States, the interest coupons for the six months' period June 15 to December 15, 1935, and demanded payment either in gold coin or legal tender currency. The treasurer refused payment on the ground that the bond to which the coupon was attached had been called for redemption on June 15, 1935\n\n\n An action followed in the Court of Claims, petitioner resting his claim upon the interest coupon only, and limiting his demand to a recovery in current dollars. \n1\n The Court gave judgment for the United States on the ground that on the designated redemption date, all coupons for later interest became void. Because of the important interests, public and private, affected by the judgment, a writ of certiorari was granted by this court, \n301 \nU.S. 679\n, 57 S.Ct. 941.\n Petitioner in No. 43 is the owner of a $50 Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/2 per cent. bond of 1933-1938, which it bought on March 9, 1935. The bond was issued pursuant to the Act of September 24, 1917 (40 Stat. 288), as amended (31 U.S.C.A.  752 et seq.), and Treasury Department Circular, No. 121. It was to mature on October 15, 1938, subject, however, to re- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 352]\n\u00a0\n demption on October 15, 1933, or later. The terms of redemption are stated in Circular No. 121, which is incorporated by reference into the bond itself. Six months notice by the Secretary of the Treasury was required. 'From the date of redemption designated in any such notice, interest on bonds called for redemption shall cease.' On October 12, 1933, the Secretary of the Treasury published a notice of call for redemption on April 15, 1934, of certain bonds of this issue. The bond now owned by petitioner is one of them. There were tenders and refusals similar to those described already in the statement of the other case. An action followed in the Court of Claims. Petitioner prayed for judgment in the sum of $1.07, the amount of the interest coupon for the six months' period ending October 15, 1934.2 The court dismissed the claim, and the case is here on certiorari.\n Respondent in No. 198 is the owner of a $1,000 First Liberty Loan 3 1\/2 per cent. bond of 1932-1947, No. 47084, purchased on March 22, 1933, for $1,011.25. This is the same bond issue involved and described in No. 42. Respondent did not present his bond for payment either on the redemption date or later. He did not present the coupon which is the foundation of the suit. However, the fact is stipulated that the Treasurer of the United States and other fiscal agents have not at any time been directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem the bonds in gold coin, but have been authorized and directed to redeem in legal tender currency. The fact is also stipulated that there was a refusal to pay similar coupons for interest accruing after the date of redemption. Respondent brought suit upon his coupon in the United States Dis- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 353]\n\u00a0\n trict Court for the District of Maryland. The District Court gave judgment in favor of the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial (Machen v. U.S., 87 F.2d 594), declining to follow the ruling which had been made by the Court of Claims. The case is here on certiorari on the petition of the Government.\n Hereafter, for convenience of reference, the bondholder in each of the three cases will be spoken of as a 'petitioner,' without adverting to the fact that in one of them (No. 198) he is actually a respondent.\n First. The so-called redemption provisions of the bonds are provisions for the acceleration of maturity at the pleasure of the Government, and upon publication of the notice of call for the period stated in the bonds the new date became substituted for the old one as if there from the beginning.\n The contract is explicit. 'From the date of redemption designated in any such notice interest on the bonds called for redemption shall cease, and all coupons thereon maturing after said date shall be void.' The contract is not to the effect that interest shall cease upon or after payment. Cf. Sterling v. H. F. Watson Co., 241 Pa. 105, 110, 88 A. 297. The contract is that interest shall cease upon the date 'designated' for payment. The rule is established that in the absence of contract or statute evincing a contrary intention, interest does not run upon claims against the Government even though there has been default in the payment of the principal. Angarica v. Bayard (U.S. v. Bayard), \n127 \nU.S. 251\n, 8 S. Ct. 1156; United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211\n, 10 S.Ct. 920; United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 336\n, 40 S.Ct. 518, 521; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 304\n, 43 S.Ct. 354, 355. The allowance of interest in eminent domain cases is only an apparent exception, which has its origin in the Constitution. Shoshone Tribe of Indians v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 476, 497\n, 57 S.Ct. 244, 251; \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 354]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Rogers, \n255 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 41 S.Ct. 281, 282. If the bonds in suit had matured at the date of natural expiration, interest would automatically have ended, whether the bonds were paid or not. Maturity at a different and accelerated date does not make the obligation greater. In the one case as in the other the interest obligation ends, and this for the simple reason that the contract says that it shall end. Upon nonpayment of principal at the original maturity, the bondholder, if unpaid, has a remedy by suit to recover principal, with interest then overdue, but not interest thereafter. Upon nonpayment of principal at the accelerated date, he has a like remedy, but no other. Default, if there has been any, is as ineffective in one situation as in the other to keep interest alive.\n Petitioners insist, however, that the notices of call were not adequate to accelerate maturity, with the result that interest continued as if notice had not been given. This surely is not so if we look to form alone and put extrinsic facts aside. 'All outstanding First Liberty Loan bonds of 1932-47 are hereby called for redemption on June 15, 1935.' 'All outstanding Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/4 per cent bonds of 1933-38, hereinafter referred to as Fourth 4 1\/4's bearing the serial numbers which have been determined by lot in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, are called for redemption on April 15, 1934, as follows' ( the serial numbers being thereupon stated). Nothing could be simpler, nothing more clearly adequate, unless the notices are to be supplemented by resort to extrinsic facts, the subject of judicial notice, which neutralize their terms. Petitioners maintain that such extrinsic facts exist. In their view, each of the two forms of notice must be read as if it incorporated within itself the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, and promised payment in the manner called for by that Resolution, and not in any other way. Thus supplemented, we are told, the notice is a nullity, for the payment that it promises is not the payment owing under the letter of the bond. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 355]\n\u00a0\n The notice of call for the redemption of the bonds was a notice, not a promise. The Secretary of the Treasury was not under a duty to make any promise as to the medium of payment. He did not undertake to make any. The obligation devolving upon the United States at the designated date was measured by the law, and the law includes the Constitution as well as statutes and resolutions. The medium of payment lawful at the time of issuing the call might be different from that prevailing at the accelerated maturity. This might happen as a consequence of an amendment of the statute. It might happen through judicial decisions adjudging a statute valid and equally through judicial decisions adjudging a statute void. The interval between notice and redemption was three months in the case of the First Liberty bonds; it was six months for the Fourth. The Secretary of the Treasury understood these possibilities when he sent out his notices for the redemption of the bonds in suit. Indeed, Perry v. United States, supra, had already been decided when bonds of the First Liberty issue were made the subject of his call. In each form of notice the implications of the call are clear. What the bondholders were told was neither more nor less than this, that at the accelerated maturity they would be entitled to payment in such form and in such measure as would discharge the obligation. The Secretary's beliefs or expectations as to what the proper form or measure would be at the appointed time are of no controlling importance, even if they were shown. The obligation was not his; it was that of the United States. His own beliefs and expectations and even those of the Government might be changed or frustrated by subsequent events. The bondholders had the assurance that the bonds would be redeemed, and they were entitled to no other. Whatever medium of payment would discharge the obligation if maturity had been attained through the natural lapse of time would dis- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 356]\n\u00a0\n charge it as completely at an accelerated maturity. The same money that would 'pay' would serve also to 'redeem.' There is no reason to believe that the one situation was distinguished from the other in the minds of the contracting parties. The sum total of existing law-Constitution and statutes and even controlling decisions, if there were any-would say how much was due.\n If this analysis is sound, it carries with it the conclusion that the call did not commit the Government either expressly or by indirection to a forbidden medium of payment. The case for the petitioners, if valid, must rest upon some other basis. A suggested basis is that the existence of the Joint Resolution amounted without more to an anticipatory breach, which made the notice of redemption void from its inception, if there was an election so to treat it, and this though the notice left the medium of payment open. But the rule of law is settled that the doctrine of anticipatory breach has in general no application to unilateral contracts, and particularly to such contracts for the payment of money only. Roehm v. Horst, \n178 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 20 S.Ct. 780; Nichols v. Scranton Steel Co., 137 N.Y. 471, 487, 33 N.E. 561; Kelly v. Security Mutual Life Ins. Co., 186 N.Y. 16, 78 N.E. 584, 9 Ann.Cas. 661; Williston, Contracts ( Rev.Ed.) vol. 5,  1328; Restatement, Contracts,  316, 318. Whatever exceptions have been recognized do not touch the case at hand. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Viglas, \n297 \nU.S. 672, 679\n, 680 S., 56 S.Ct. 615, 618. Moreover, an anticipatory breach, if it were made out, could have no effect upon the right of the complaining bondholders to postpone the time of payment to the date of natural maturity. The sole effect, if any, would be to clothe them with a privilege to declare payment overdue, which is precisely the result that they are seeking to avoid. The conclusion therefore follows that for the purpose of the present controversy the breach would be immaterial even if it were not unreal. But its unreality is the feature we \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 357]\n\u00a0\n prefer to dwell upon. The Government was not subject to a duty to keep the content of the dollar constant during the period intervening between promise and performance. The erroneous assumption of the existence of such a duty vitiates any argument in favor of the petitioners as to an anticipatory breach just as it vitiates their argument as to the implications of the call. The duty of the Government and its only one was to pay the bonds when due. If the statutes had been amended before the date of redemption or if the courts had decided that payment must be made in good or in currency proportioned to the earlier content of the dollar, there is little likelihood that any one would judge the efficacy of the notice by the test of the law in force at the date of its announcement.\n The petitioners being dislodged from the position that the notices of call were void in their inception are perforce driven to the stand that they became nullities thereafter, when the statutes were unrepealed at the designated date. But at the designated date the accelerated maturity was already an accomplished fact. The duty of payment did not arise in advance of maturity. In the very nature of things it presupposes maturity as a preliminary condition. If there had been any different intention, the bonds would have provided that interest should cease upon payment or lawful tender, and not from the date of redemption stated in the call. This is not a case of mutual promises or covenants with performance to be rendered on each side at a given time and place. The obligees were not under a duty to do anything at all at the accelerated maturity, though they were privileged, if they pleased, to present the bonds for payment. Most of the learning as to dependent and independent promises in the law of bilateral contracts (Loud v. Pomona Land & Water Co., \n153 \nU.S. 564, 576\n, 14 S.Ct. 928) is thus beside the mark. This is a case of a unilateral contract where \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 358]\n\u00a0\n the only act of performance, the payment of the bonds, was one owing from the obligor, and arose by hypothesis upon maturity and not before. Let maturity, whether normal or accelerated, be accepted as a postulate, and it must follow that default in payment will not change the date again. If the Government were to come forward with a tender a day or a week after the designated date, the obligees would not be sustained in a rejection of the payment on the theory that the original date of maturity had been restored by the delay. If the obligees were to sue after the designated date, the Government would not be heard to say that because of the default in payment, the proposed acceleration was imperfect and inchoate. As pointed out already, the bondholders became entitled, when once the notice had been published, to a measure and medium of payment sufficient to discharge the debts. If the then existing acts of Congress were valid altogether, payment would be sufficient if made in the then prevailing currency. If the acts were invalid, either wholly or in some degree, there might be need of something more, how much being dependent upon the operation of an implied obligation, read into the bonds by a process of construction, to render an equivalent. Whatever the form and measure, the bondholders had a remedy if they had chosen to invoke it.\n We do not now determine the effect of a notice given in bad faith with a preconceived intention to withhold performance later. Fraud vitiates nearly every form of conduct affected by its taint, but fraud has not been proved and indeed has not been charged. There is no reason to doubt that a Secretary of the Treasury who was willing to give notice of redemption after knowledge of the decision in Perry v. United States understood that the obligation of the Government would be measured by the Constitution and not by any statute, in so far as the two might be found to be in conflict. Never for a moment \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 359]\n\u00a0\n was there less than complete submission to the supremacy of law. At the utmost, there was honest mistake as to rights and liabilities in a situation without precedent. Fraud being eliminated, the case acquires a new clarity. When we reach the heart of the matter, putting confusing verbiage aside and fixing our gaze upon essentials, the obligation of the bonds can be expressed in a simplifying paraphrase. 'This bond shall be payable on June 15, 1947, or (upon three months notice by the Secretary of the Treasury) on June 15, 1932, or any interest date thereafter.' That is what was meant. That in substance is what was said. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n No question of constitutional law is involved in the decision of these cases. No question is here as to the correctness of the decision in Perry v. United States, or as to the meaning or effect of the opinion there announced. All such inquiries are put aside as unnecessary to the solution of the problem now before us. Irrespective of the validity or invalidity of the whole or any part of the legislation of recent years devaluing the dollar, the maturity of the bonds in suit was accelerated by valid notice. As a consequence of such acceleration the right to interest has gone.\n Second. The Secretary of the Treasury did not act in excess of his lawful powers by issuing the calls without further authority from the Congress than was conferred by the statutes under which the bonds were issued. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 360]\n\u00a0\n The argument to the contrary is inconsistent with the plain provisions of the statutes and also of the bonds themselves.\n There was also confirmation of his power in subsequent enactments. Victory Liberty Loan Act,  6, 40 Stat. 1311, as amended, March 2, 1923, 42 Stat. 1427, and January 30, 1934,  14(b), 48 Stat. 344 (31 U.S.C.A.  767); Gold Reserve Act of 1934,  14, 48 Stat. 343 (31 U.S.C.A.  752, 754a, 754b, 757a, 767); Act of February 4, 1935,  2, 4, 49 Stat. 20 (31 U.S.C.A.  753, 754).\n Third. In issuing the calls, the Secretary of the Treasury was not limited by the Act of March 18, 1869 (Rev.St.  3693; 16 Stat. 1 (31 U.S. CA.  731) which in its day placed restrictions upon the redemption by the Government of interest-bearing bonds.\n The aim of that statute was the protection of holders of United States obligations not bearing interest, the 'greenbacks' of that era. 'The bonds of the United States are not to be paid before maturity, while the noteholders are to be kept without their redemption, unless the noteholders are able at the same time to convert their notes into coin.' Statement of Robert C. Schenck, one of the House Managers, Congressional Globe, March 3, 1869, p. 1879. Upon the resumption of specie payments in 1879 the aim of the statute was achieved, and its restrictions are no longer binding.\n The judgments in Nos. 42 and 43 should be affirmed, and that in No. 198 reversed. Ordered accordingly.\n Affirmed in part, and reversed in part.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result.\n I think the court below, in the Machen Case (C.C.A.) 87 F.2d 594, correctly interpreted the bonds involved in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 361]\n\u00a0\n these cases has reserving to the government the privilege of accelerating their maturity by paying them or standing ready to pay them on any interest date according to their tenor, and upon giving the specified notice fixing the 'date of redemption.' The words 'redeemed' and 'redemption,' as used in the bonds1 point the way in which the privilege was to be exercised as plainly as when they are written in the bonds of a private lender. Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 579\n, 54 S.Ct. 840, 843; cf. Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 352\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 435, 95 A.L.R. 1335. If payment, or readiness to pay the bonds in accordance with their terms was essential to 'redemption', the one or the other, equally with the required notice, was a condition of acceleration.\n The obligation of the bonds, read in the light of long-established custom and of our own decision in Holyoke Water Power Co. v. American Writing Paper Co., \n300 \nU.S. 324, 336\n, 57 S.Ct. 485, decided since the Perry Case, must, I think, be taken to be a 'gold value' undertaking to pay in gold dollars of the specified weight and finess or their equivalent in lawful currency. Compare Norman v. B. & O.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240, 302\n, 55 S.Ct. 407, 413, 95 A.L.R. 1352; Feist v. Societe Intercommunale Belge D'Electricite, L.R. (1934) A.C. 172, 173. The suppression of the use of gold as money, and the restriction on its export, and of its use in international exchange by Acts \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 362]\n\u00a0\n of Congress, 48 Stat. 1, 337, did not relieve the Government of its obligation to pay the stipulated gold value of the bonds in lawful currency. Hence it has not complied, or ever stood ready to comply, with one of the two conditions upon performance of which the bonds 'may be redeemed and paid' in advance of their due date; the payment to the bondholder of the currency equivalent of the stipulated gold value.\n It will not do to say that performance of this condition can be avoided or dispensed with by the adoption of any form of words in the notice. Nor can it be said that a declaration, in the notice, of intention to pay whatever can be collected in court, see the Perry Case, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, at page 354, 55 S.Ct. 432, 436, 95 A.L.R. 1335, is equivalent to a notice of readiness to pay the currency equivalent of the gold value stipulated to be paid, or that a statement of purpose to pay what will constitutionally satisfy the debt suffices to accelerate although no payment of the currency equivalent is made or contemplated or is permitted by the statutes. It follows that judgment must go for the bondholders unless the Joint Resolution of Congress of June 5, 1933, 48 Stat. 112 (31 U.S.C.A.  462, 463, 821) requiring the discharge of all gold obligations 'dollar for dollar' in lawful currency, and declaring void as against public policy all provisions of such obligations calling for gold payments, is to be pronounced constitutional.\n Decision of the constitutional question being in my opinion now unavoidable, I am moved to state shortly my reasons for the view that government bonds do not stand on any different footing from those of private individuals and that the Joint Resolution in the one case, as in the other, was a constitutional exercise of the power to regulate the value of money. Compare Norman v. B. & O.R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at pages 304, 309, 55 S.Ct. 407, 414, 416, 95 A.L.R. 1352. Without elaborating the point, it is enough for present purposes to say that the undertaking of the United States to pay its obligations in gold, if binding, operates to thwart the exercise of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 363]\n\u00a0\n constitutional power in the same manner and to the same degree pro tanto as do bonds issued by private individuals, Norman v. B. & O.R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at page 311 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 407, 417, 95 A.L. R. 1352, except in so far as the Government resorts to its sovereign immunity from suit. Had the undertaking been given any force in the Gold Clause Cases, or the meaning which we have since attributed to it when used in private contracts, it would, if valid and but for the immunity from suit, have defeated the Government policy of suspension of gold payments and devaluation of the dollar. Compare the Norman Case, supra, with the concurring memorandum in Perry v. United States, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, at pages 360, 361, 55 S.Ct. 432, 439, 95 A.L.R. 1335.\n The very fact of the existence of such immunity, which admits of the creation of only such government obligations as are enforceable at the will of the sovereign, is persuasive that the power to borrow money 'on the credit' of the United States cannot be taken to be a limitation of the power to regulate the value of money. Looking to the purposes for which that power is conferred upon the National Government, its exercise, if justified at all, is as essential in the case of bonds of the National Government as it is in the case of bonds of states, municipalities, and private individuals. See Norman v. B. & O.R. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, at page 313 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 407, 418, 95 A.L.R. 1352. Its effect on the bondholders is the same in every case. Compare Norman v. B. & O.R. Co., supra, with Nortz v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 317\n, 55 S.Ct. 428, 95 A.L.R. 1346. No reason of public policy or principle of construction of the instrument itself has ever been suggested, so far as I am aware, which would explain why the power to regulate the currency, which is not restricted by the Fifth Amendment in the case of any obligation, is controlled, in the case of government bonds, by the borrowing clause which imposes no obligation which the Government is not free to discard at any time through its immunity from suit. I cannot say that the borrowing clause which is without force to compel the sovereign to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 364]\n\u00a0\n pay nevertheless renders the government powerless to exercise the specifically granted authority to regulate the value of money with which payment is to be made.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (concurring).\n Agreeing altogether with the opinion of Mr. Justice CARDOZO, which deals only with the construction of the contract and the rights flowing from the notice, I find it unnecessary, and therefore inappropriate, to express any opinion as to the validity of the Joint Resolution of 1933 (31 U.S.C.A.  462, 463, 821) or other acts of legislation devaluing the dollar.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I cannot acquiesce in the conclusion approved by the majority of the Court. In our view it gives effect to an act of bad faith and upholds patent repudiation. Its wrongfulness is betokened by the circumlocution presented in defense.\n The suit is to recover in currency of today the face value of a past- due coupon originally attached to a 3 1\/2 per cent. bond of the United States issued in 1917 and payable 1947; nothing else.\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, to which little can be added, sets out the important facts, and adequately supports its judgment.\n In 1917, when gold coins contained 25.8 grains to the dollar, the United States obtained needed funds by selling coupon bonds, among them the one here involved. They solemnly agreed to pay the holder one thousand dollars on June 15, 1947, with semiannual interest, in 'gold coin of the present standard of value' subject to the following option: 'All or any of the bonds of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 365]\n\u00a0\n series of which this is one may be redeemed1 and paid at the pleasure of the United States on or after June 15, 1932, on any semi-annual interest payment date or dates, at the face value thereof and interest accrued at the date of redemption, on notice published at least three months prior to the redemption date. ... From the date of redemption designated in any such notice, interest on the bonds called for redemption shall cease, and all coupons thereon maturing after such date shall be void.'\n The promise is to pay one thousand dollars in gold coin, 1917 standard. The face value of the bond is one thousand gold dollars. The option reserved is to redeem and pay after notice by giving the holder that number of such dollars. The notice required is nothing less than a declaration of bona fide purpose to redeem or pay off the obligation as written; no other right was reserved. A notice divorced from that purpose could amount to nothing more than a dishonest effort to defeat the contract and defraud the creditor. It would not come within the fair intendment of the contract; would not, in truth, designate a 'date of redemption'; and, therefore, could not hasten the maturity of the principal or cause interest to cease. All this seems obvious, if respect is to be accorded to the ordinary rules of construction and principles of law governing contracts.\n The obligation of the bond was declared by this Court in Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 351\n, 353 S., 354, 55 S.Ct. 432, 435, 436, 95 A.L.R. 1335, to be a pledge of the credit of the United States and an assurance of payment as stipulated which Congress had no power to withdraw or ignore. 'The United States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudia- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 366]\n\u00a0\n tion, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a State or a municipality or a citizen.' 'The power of the Congress to alter or repudiate the substance of its own engagements when it has borrowed money under the authority which the Constitution confers' was there denied. 'The binding quality of the promise of the United States is of the essence of the credit which is so pledged. Having this power to authorize the issue of definite obligations for the payment of money borrowed, the Congress has not been vested with authority to alter or destroy those obligations. The fact that the United States may not be sued without its consent is a matter of procedure which does not affect the legal and binding character of its contracts. While the Congress is under no duty to provide remedies through the courts, the contractual obligation still exists, and, despite infirmities of procedure, remains binding upon the conscience of the sovereign.'\n The right to redeem and pay the bond at face value after notice was reserved; nothing else. Did the United States give notice of a bona fide purpose so to redeem and pay? If not they cannot properly claim to have exercised their option to mature the obligation. That they did not honestly comply with this necessary preliminary becomes obvious upon consideration of the circumstances and pertinent legislation.\n There is no question here concerning the Government committing itself through notice sent out by the Secretary of the Treasury expressly or indirectly to a forbidden medium of payment. No question of an anticipatory breach of contract. The Government simply has not in good faith complied with a condition precedent. It has never given notice of purpose to pay the obligation according to its terms. Its suggestion was to make payment of another kind.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals well said: \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 367]\n\u00a0\n 'The notice calling the bond for payment was in the usual form; and there is no question but that it would have had the effect of stopping the running of interest and avoiding the coupons maturing after June 15, 1935, except for the legislation of Congress effecting the currency, which limited the power of the Secretary of the Treasury and must be read into the notice. At the time of the issuance of the bond the gold dollar was the standard of value in our monetary system and was defined by law as consisting of 25.8 grains of gold nine-tenths fine. Act of March 14, 1900, c. 41,  1, 31 Stat. 45, 31 U.S.C.A.  314. And the statutes provided for the use of gold coin as a medium of exchange. R.S.  3511. By Presidential Proclamation of January 31, 1934, (No. 2067, 31 U.S.C.A.  821 note) issued under the act of May 12, 1933 (48 Stat. 52, 53), as amended by the Act of January 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 342, 31 U.S.C.A.  821), the content of the dollar was reduced to 15-5\/21 grains of gold nine-tenths fine; and, at the time of the publication of the notice calling the bond for payment, gold coin had been withdrawn from circulation, its possession had been prohibited under penalty, and payment in gold coin by the United States had been prohibited. 48 Stat. 337, 340 (31 U.S.C.A.  441-443, 315b). By joint resolution of June 5, 1933 (48 Stat. 112, 113 (31 U.S.C.A.  462, 463, 821)), the payment of gold clause bonds in any legal tender currency 'dollar for dollar' had been authorized; and it was paper currency based on the 15-5\/21 grain dollar, and nothing else, that was offered in payment of gold clause bonds which were called for payment by the Treasury. The notice of redemption calling the bond in question for payment was equivalent, therefore, to a notice that the United States elected to redeem the bond in paper currency based on a 15-5\/21 grain dollar, notwithstanding that it was payable in gold coin based on a 25-8\/10 grain dollar and might be redeemed only at its face value. ...\n'It is manifest that when the bonds were payable in gold coin of the standard of value at the time of issue, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 329, 368]\n\u00a0\n i.e., 25-8\/10 grains of gold to the dollar, a proposal to redeem them in paper money based upon 15-5\/21 grains of gold to the dollar was not a proposal to redeem them at face value; and a notice that the government would redeem them on such basis, which is what the notice in question means when considered as it must be in connection with the legislation binding upon the Secretary of the Treasury, was not such a notice as the bonds prescribed for the exercise of the option retained by the government.'\n\n We are not now concerned with the power of the United States to discharge obligations at maturity in depreciated currency or clipped coin. Did they cause respondent's bond to mature before the ultimate due date by proper exercise of the option reserved when they sent out a notice which in effect stated that payment would not be made as provided by the bond, but otherwise? The answer ought not to be difficult where men anxiously uphold the doctrine that a contractual obligation 'remains binding upon the conscience of the sovereign' and reverently fix their gaze on the Eighth Commandment.\n We concur in the views tersely expressed in the following paragraph excerpted from the opinion below: 'No amount of argument can obscure the real situation. It is this: The government has promised to pay the bonds in question in gold coin of the standard of value prevailing in 1917. By their terms, it is permitted to redeem them only by paying them at their face value. It is proposing to redeem them, not by paying them at that face value, but in paper money worth only about 59 per cent. thereof. The notice which it has issued means this and nothing else. Such a notice is not in accordance with the condition of redemption specified in the bond, and consequently does not stop the running of interest or avoid the coupons.'\n The challenged judgment was correct, and should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Joint Resolution of Aug. 27, 1935 49 Stat. 938, 939 (31 U.S.C.A .  773a-773d), withdrawing the consent of the United States to suit where the claimant asserted against it a right, privilege or power 'upon any gold-clause securities of the United States or for interest thereon' makes an exception of any suit begun by January 1, 1936, as well as any proceeding 'in which no claim is made for payment or credit in an amount in excess of the face or nominal value in dollars of the securities, coins or currencies of the United States involved in such proceeding.' (31 U.S.C. A.  773b.) Petitioner has brought himself within each branch of the exception. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The coupon reads as follows: 'The United States of America will pay to bearer on October 15, 1934, at the Treasury Department, Washington, or at a designated agency, $1.07, being six months' interest then due on $50 Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/4% Gold Bonds of 1933-1938 unless called for previous redemption.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Important differences exist, and are not to be ignored, between the retirement of shares of stock (Sterling v. H. F. Watson Co., supra; Corbett v. McClintic Marshall Corp., 17 Del.Ch. 165, 151 A. 218), and the accelerated payment of money obligations, and also between the acceleration of the obligations of the Government and those of other obligors. In the case of private obligations, a liability for interest survives the acceleration of the debt and continues until payment. In the case of Government obligations, interest does not continue after maturity ( in the absence of statute or agreement) though payment is not made. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The redemption clause is as follows: 'The principal and interest of this bond shall be payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value, ... All or any of the bonds of the series of which this is one may be redeemed and paid at the pleasure of the United States on or after June 15, 1932, or on any semi-annual interest payment date or dates, at the face value thereof and interest accrued at the date of redemption, on notice published at least three months prior to the redemption date, and published thereafter from time to time during said three months period as the Secretary of the Treasury shall direct. ... From the date of redemption designated in any such notice interest on the bonds called for redemption shall cease, and all coupons thereon maturing after said date shall be void. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Redeem-5.

UNITED STATES(1937)\nNo. 614\nArgued: March 12, 1937Decided: March 29, 1937\n\n\n [ Sonzinsky v. United States   \n300 \nU.S. 506\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 506\n, 507]\n\u00a0\n\n  Mr. Harold J. Bandy, of Granite City, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 506\n, 510]\n\u00a0\n  Mr. Brien McMahon, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 506\n, 511]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question for decision is whether section 2 of the National Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, c. 757, 48 Stat. 1236, 26 \nU.S.C.  1132- 1132q (26 \nU.S.C.A.  1132-1132q), which imposes a $200 annual license tax on dealers in firearms, is a constitutional exercise of the legislative power of Congress.\n  Petitioner was convicted by the District Court for Eastern Illinois on two counts of an indictment, the first charging him with violation of section 2 (26 \nU.S.C.A.  1132a), by dealing in firearms without payment of the tax. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the conviction on the second count and affirmed on the first. 86 F.(2d) 486. On petition of the accused we granted certiorari, limited to the question of the constitutional validity of the statute in its application under the first count in the indictment. \n300 \nU.S. 648\n.\n  Section 2 of the National Firearms Act (26 \nU.S.C.A.  1132a) requires every dealer in firearms to register with the Collector of Internal Revenue in the district where he carries on business, and to pay a special excise tax of $200 a year. Importers or manufacturers are taxed $500 a year. Section 3 (26 \nU.S.C.A.  1132b) imposes a tax of $200 on each transfer of a firearm, payable by the transferor, and section 4 (26 \nU.S.C. A.  1132c) prescribes regulations for the identification of purchasers. The term 'firearm' is defined by section 1 (26 U.S.C.A.  1132) as meaning a shotgun or a rifle having a barrel less than eighteen inches in length, or any other weapon, ex- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 506\n, 512]\n\u00a0\n cept a pistol or revolver, from which a shot is discharged by an explosive, if capable of being concealed on the person, or a machine gun, and includes a muffler or silencer for any firearm. As the conviction for nonpayment of the tax exacted by section 2 has alone been sustained, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the different tax levied by section 3 and the regulations pertaining to it are valid. Section 16 (26 U.S.C.A.  1132o) declares that the provisions of the act are separable. Each tax is on a different activity and is collectible independently of the other. Full effect may be given to the license tax standing alone, even though all other provisions are invalid. Weller v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 319, 45\n S. Ct. 556; Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 697\n; cf. Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 234\n, 564, 86 A.L.R. 403.\n  In the exercise of its constitutional power to lay taxes, Congress may select the subjects of taxation, choosing some and omitting others. See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 158\n, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 516\n; Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n. Its power extends to the imposition of exercise taxes upon the doing of business. See License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462; Spreckles Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397, 412\n; United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 94\n. Petitioner does not deny that Congress may tax his business as a dealer in firearms. He insists that the present levy is not a true tax, but a penalty imposed for the purpose of suppressing traffic in a certain noxious type of firearms, the local regulation of which is reserved to the states because not granted to the national government. To establish its penal and prohibitive character, he relies on the amounts of the tax imposed by section 2 on dealers, manufacturers, and importers, and of the tax imposed by section 3 on each transfer of a 'firearm,' payable by the transferor. The cumulative effect on the distribution of a limited class of firearms, of relatively small value, by the successive imposition of different taxes, one on the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 506\n, 513]\n\u00a0\n business of the importer or manufacturer, another on that of the dealer, and a third on the transfer to a buyer, is said to be prohibitive in effect and to disclose unmistakably the legislative purpose to regulate rather than to tax.\n  The case is not one where the statute contains regulatory provisions related to a purported tax in such a way as has enabled this Court to say in other cases that the latter is a penalty resorted to as a means of enforcing the regulations. See Child Labor Tax Cases, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 35\n, 450, 21 A.L.R. 1432; Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44\n; Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238, 56\n S. Ct. 855. Nor is the subject of the tax described or treated as criminal by the taxing statute. Compare United States v. Constantine, \n296 \nU.S. 287\n. Here section 2 contains no regulation other than the mere registration provisions, which are obviously supportable as in aid of a revenue purpose. On its face it is only a taxing measure, and we are asked to say that the tax, by virtue of its deterrent effect on the activities taxed, operates as a regulation which is beyond the congressional power.\n  Every tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed. But a tax is not any the less a tax because it has a regulatory effect, United States v. Doremus, supra, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 94; Nigro v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 332, 353\n, 354, 394, 395; License Tax Cases, supra; see Child Labor Tax Cases, supra, \n259 \nU.S. 20, 38\n, 451, 21 A.L.R. 1432; and it has long been established that an Act of Congress which on its face purports to be an exercise of the taxing power is not any the less so because the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the thing taxed.

They will not undertake, by collateral inquiry as to the measure of the regulatory effect of a tax, to ascribe to Congress an attempt, under the guise of taxation, to exercise another power denied by the Federal Constitution. McCray v. United States, supra; cf. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 45\n, 601.\n  Here the annual tax of $200 is productive of some revenue. \n1\n We are not free to speculate as to the motives which moved Congress to impose it, or as to the extent to which it may operate to restrict the activities taxed. As it is not attended by an offensive regulation, and since it operates as a tax, it is within the national taxing power. Alston v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 289, 294\n; Nigro v.

STATE OF ALABAMA(1937)\nNo. 570\nArgued: March 10, 1937Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama.\n Messrs. Forney Johnston and Jos. F. Johnston, both of Birmingham, Ala ., for appellants.\n Mr. Frontis H. Moore, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellee. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the validity of a franchise tax assessed pursuant to a statute of the State of Alabama upon the Southern Natural Gas Corporation. The imposition of the tax was assailed as a direct burden upon interstate commerce and as also depriving the corporation of its property without due process of law and denying it the equal protection of the laws contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the State sustained the tax ( 170 So. 178) and the case comes here on appeal.\n The statute, enacted in pursuance of section 232 of the State Constitution, is section 54 of Act No. 163, General Acts of Alabama 1927, page 176, provides:\n'That every corporation organized under the laws of any other state, nation, or territory, and doing business in this State, except strictly benevolent, educational or religious corporations, shall pay annually to the State an annual franchise tax of Two Dollars ($2.00) on each One Thousand Dollars of the actual amount of capital employed in this State.'\n\n The assessment was made by the State Tax Commission for the year 1931 in the sum of $11,047.43 and was said to be based upon capital employed in Alabama amounting to $5,523,715. Appellant resisted the assessment upon the ground that it was not doing business and did not propose to do business in the State of Alabama except in interstate commerce and that the property by which the tax was measured was used exclusively in interstate commerce.\n The case was submitted upon an agreed statement from which the following facts appear:\n Appellant was organized prior to May 12, 1928, under the laws of Delaware and on that date it qualified to do \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n business in Alabama. It named a statutory agent and filed in the office of the Secretary of State a copy of its charter which covered a wide range of activities. \n1\n It has paid annually the required permit fee. At the time of the assessment in question appellant maintained its office and chief place of business in the city of Birmingham, Ala. The entire management, control, and conduct of its business was conducted from that office.\n Appellant is engaged in the transmission and distribution of gas which it purchases from the producers in the Louisiana and Mississippi fields. In May, 1929, it began the construction of its pipe lines and by January, 1931, it had constructed its main lines from the Louisiana fields to Atlanta and Columbus, Ga., the Columbus line turning south from the Atlanta line at a point near Tuscaloosa, Ala. In 1931, appellant owned approximately 564 miles of pipe and various items of real and personal property located within Alabama, all constituting part of its general transmission system. It was agreed that in the event that it should be held that all of appellant's property located in the State was subject to the assessment of a franchise tax, the value of that property as of January 1 to May 13, 1931, the date of the final assessment, was $5,500, 000.\n Appellant had contracts for the delivery of natural gas in Alabama to only four purchasers. Three were intrastate utilities in Alabama, the Alabama Natural Gas Corporation, the Southern Cities Public Service Com- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n pany, and the Birmingham Gas Company. These companies were not consumers but were engaged, either directly or through subsidiaries, in the distribution of natural gas as public utilities in the State of Alabama. The fourth purchaser was the Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Company, a subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation, which purchased gas for itself and affiliated companies operating steel and industrial plants in the Birmingham district and which were not public utilities but consumers. A majority of orders for gas were received by and cleared through the Birmingham office; all collections for sales were received and disbursements for expenses were made or authorized at that office. The sales to the Tennessee Company and its affiliates were made from time to time upon orders given by the Birmingham office as the needs of the purchasers required.\n The gas sold to the above-named purchasers was delivered in continuous movement from the gas fields in Louisiana or Mississippi without break or interruption, to the point where it was delivered, viz., the meter house at which the gas so sold was measured for the purpose of payment. The gas was moved under unregulated gas pressure, as produced by the natural pressure of the gas wells, to the designated points of delivery. The stipulation of facts also states that in the sales to the Tennessee Company and its affiliates the pressure is reduced at the point of delivery for the accommodation of the purchaser to meet its needs and requirements. The general practice is thus described in appellant's brief: 'All gas delivered in Alabama moved under main line pressure in continuous movement from the wells in Louisiana to the immediate point of delivery in Alabama, where it was reduced in pressure and measured for the sole purpose of effecting delivery.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n The agreed statement set forth appellant's contracts with the Alabama Natural Gas Corporation and the Tennessee Company, respectively. These contained detailed provisions as to delivery, pressure, measurement, etc. In the contract with the Tennessee Company provision was made for the establishment of service lines to the consuming plants, as follows, appellant being described as 'Seller':\n'Seller shall at its own expense provide in advance of the initial delivery date of March 1, 1930, service lines of suitable size to a point mutually agreed upon on the property of Buyer's Bessemer plant. To reach Buyer's Fairfield Plant Seller shall provide a service line that will cross Buyer's Ensley property and run in a southwesterly direction on the property of Buyer to some point mutually agreed upon, on Buyer's Fairfield premises. Buyer agree that it will make no charge for right of way for any part of the service lines traversing its property. A suitable meter will be provided for metering gas that may be used in the Bessemer plant, in the Ensley plant and in the Fairfield plant, of the Buyer and the plants of other subsidiary companies.'\n\n These plants, the state court said, were 'widely separated.' The contract also provides:\n'The natural gas shall be delivered at a pressure of not less than 30 pounds gauge at some mutually satisfactory location or locations upon the premises of Buyer, and Seller shall there furnish, install, operate and maintain at its own expense regulating and measuring station or stations properly equipped with orifice meters and recording gauges or other type of meter or meters of stand- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n ard style as may be mutually agreed upon conformable to the current recommendations of Gas Measurements Committee of American Gas Association, the measurement by which shall fix the total amount of natural gas delivered by Seller to Buyer.\n\n'The measuring equipment so installed by Seller, together with any building erected by it for such equipment, shall be and remain its property.'\n\n First.-The statute, which is challenged as here applied, was under consideration in Anglo-Chilean Nitrate Sales Corporation v. Alabama, \n288 \nU.S. 218\n, 53 S.Ct. 373. In the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the State, this Court concluded that the tax was laid 'not upon the authorization, right, or privilege to do business in Alabama, but upon the actual doing of business.' Id., \n288 \nU.S. 218\n, at page 223, 53 S.Ct. 373, 374. The tax was held invalid as applied to a foreign corporation whose sole business in the State consisted in the landing, storage, and sale in the original packages, of goods imported from abroad. In the instant case the Supreme Court of the State has reviewed its rulings and has expounded the meaning of the statute. The state court holds that the tax is a franchise tax laid 'upon the right to do business.' It is a tax levied 'on foreign corporations as a prerogative to the right of exercise of its corporate functions in the state.' It 'is not on any basis a tax on business' but is laid 'on the exercise of corporate functions, or on the privilege of exercising 555, at page 565, 45 S.Ct. 184, 186, 69 L.Ed. and its employment of its capital in Alabama.'\n By compliance with the statute appellant obtained the privilege of engaging within the State in any of the activities which its charter authorized.\n Second.-Appellant made Birmingham, Ala., its headquarters for the transaction of business. The 'entire management' was conducted from its principal office at that place. There, as the state court said, was 'the control of the business in all of its aspects.' There orders \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n for deliveries of gas under its contracts and all collections from sales were received and all disbursements were made or authorized. While Delaware was the State of incorporation, appellant's commercial domicile was in Alabama. Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 193, 211\n, 56 S. Ct. 773, 777\n\n\n From the agreed facts we are unable to conclude that the business thus conducted in Alabama was entirely an interstate business. While the gas which appellant sold was brought into the State from Louisiana, it appears that appellant carried on in Alabama activities of an intrastate character. We had occasion in East Ohio Gas Company v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S.Ct. 499, 501, to consider the distinction between the transportation of gas into a State and the furnishing of the gas so transported to consumers within the State. We observed in that case that 'when the gas passes from the distribution lines into the supply mains, it necessarily is relieved of nearly all the pressure put upon it at the stations of the producing companies,' its volume is expanded, and it is divided into the smaller streams that enter the service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumer's premises. In that case, the Ohio Company furnished gas to consumers in municipalities by means of distribution plants and that activity was held to be not interstate commerce but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State. The Court quoted with approval the statement in Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Company, \n265 \nU.S. 298, 309\n, 44 S.Ct. 544, 546, that 'The business of supplying, on demand, local consumers is a local business, even though the gas be brought from another state and drawn for distribution directly from interstate mains; and this is so whether the local distribution be made by the transporting company or by independent distributing companies. In such case the local interest is paramount, and the interference with interstate commerce, if any, indirect and of minor importance.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 155]\n\u00a0\n While the facts of the two cases are not the same, there is a clear analogy. For here under its contract with the Tennessee Company, which bought for consumption by itself and its subsidiaries in industrial plants, appellant agreed not simply to install metering stations, for measuring the amount of gas delivered, but to establish the requisite service lines running to the described plants in order that the gas might be furnished in a manner suited to the consumers' needs. The gas was supplied through these service lines on the orders received from time to time at the Birmingham office. We perceive no essential distinction in law between the establishment of such a local activity to meet the needs of consumers in industrial plants and the service to consumers in the municipalities which was found in the Ohio Case to constitute an intrastate business. As was said in that case: 'The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale, and sold at retail.'\n The facts thus distinguish the instant case from that of Ozark Pipe Line Corporation v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.Ct. 184. There the corporation operated a pipe line extending from Oklahoma through Missouri to a point in Illinois. Missouri sought to tax the privilege of doing business within the State. But nothing was done in Missouri except in furtherance of transportation. Oil was neither received nor delivered in that State. The business actually carried on 'was exclusively in interstate commerce' and whatever was done within Missouri in the maintenance of an office or otherwise was 'all exclusively in furtherance of its interstate business.' Id., \n266 \nU.S. 5558\n at page 565, 45 S.Ct. 184, 186. In Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Company, supra, as noted above, the distinction was pointed out. There 'the transportation, sale and delivery' of the gas constituted an 'unbroken chain, fundamentally interstate from beginning to end.' So, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 148, 156]\n\u00a0\n the case of State Tax Commission v. Interstate Natural Gas Company, \n284 \nU.S. 41\n, 52 S.Ct. 62, rested upon the conclusion that what was done was wholly incidental to interstate commerce between Louisiana and Mississippi. There were no such local activities as are present here to carry the transactions of the company into the field of state authority.\n That authority was held to be properly exerted in the case of Atlantic Lumber Company v. Commissioner, \n298 \nU.S. 553\n, 56 S.Ct. 887. The corporation was organized in Delaware but it did not 'function there,' but in Massachusetts. There it established its office for the exercise of its corporate powers. That was the headquarters for salesmen who solicited orders in that and other states. There orders were accepted and remittances received. The corporation was engaged in the wholesale lumber business and owned practically all the stock of three subsidiaries, two of which were engaged in cutting timber and manufacturing lumber in other states, and a third held title to timber lands in Louisiana. The court said that if appellant did nothing but transact interstate business, the excise tax sought to be levied with respect to the doing of business in Massachusetts could not stand, but in view of the activities conducted in Massachusetts and the corporate functions there exercised, the court decided that the privilege tax was valid and that the effect upon interstate commerce, so far as there was any, was 'remote and incidental.' Because of the local activities, the decision in the Ozark Case was held to be inapplicable.\n Third.-As Alabama was competent to lay a franchise tax upon appellant for the privilege of doing an intrastate business, it was competent to measure the tax by the capital employed within the State provided the tax was not so laid as to discriminate against interstate commerce or otherwise lay a direct burden upon it.

Commissioner, supra.\n There is here no attempt to tax property that is beyond the boundaries of the State. The tax was laid only upon property employed within the State, and enforcement is left to the ordinary means of collecting taxes. The rule was thus stated in International Shoe Company v. Shartel, supra: 'A franchise tax imposed on a corporation, foreign or domestic, for the privilege of doing a local business, if apportioned to business done or property owned within the state, is not invalid ... because a part of the property or capital included in computing the tax is used by it in interstate commerce.' There is no showing of any direct burden upon interstate commerce, the effect upon that commerce being incidental and remote, not differing in this respect from the effect of ordinary ad valorem taxation of property within the State. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, supra; St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Arkansas, supra.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The charter authorized appellant to store, transport, buy and sell oil, gas, salt, brine, and other mineral solutions; to manufacture, acquire, distribute, use, and sell artificial gas, with by-products; to mine, produce, buy, use, sell, and distribute natural gas, with by- products; to produce, buy, use, sell, and distribute a mixture of artificial and natural gas; to construct, acquire and operate all works and all pipe lines, mains, plants, systems, etc., for the above purposes, with the power of eminent domain; to acquire, manufacture, and deal in ice. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Appellant makes an explanatory statement in a foot note as follows: 'It is a matter of general knowledge that long distance transmission of natural gas (appellant's system comprising about 1000 miles) moves under line pressure of approximately 400 pounds, greatly in excess of the requirement or required tensile strength of the distribution pipes of the utility or other purchasers from the long distance transportation company.' \n\n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF TEXAS v.

Kellough, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ is limited to the questions raised on the application of Texas to the United States court for the Northern District of that State in a proceeding under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended1 for permission to institute proceedings in a state court for the confiscation of oil held by the trustee but claimed by the State as 'unlawful oil' because produced or transported in violation of state conservation measures.\n Texas statutes2 and orders of its Railroad Commission purport to prorate production of crude oil, to prohibit purchase, transportation, or handling of that produced in whole or in part in excess of the amount allowed,3 to impose fines and penalties for violations,4 and to make oil produced or transported in violation of statute or order subject to confiscation in an action brought by the State for that purpose. \n5\n The statute declares that if at the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n trial it shall be found that the oil is unlawful, the court shall render judgment forfeiting the same to the State and authorizing an order directed to sheriff or constable commanding him 'to seize and sell' the condemned oil. Costs of suit and expenses of the sale are to be paid out of money received from the oil, and the balance becomes part of the general revenue fund of the State.\n There is before us no question as to validity of the State's measures to regulate production, or as to when, if ever, the oil in controversy became forfeit. \n6\n The sole issue is whether the bankruptcy court should have permitted the State to bring suit in a state court to have the oil adjudged confiscate.\n These are the facts.\n Texas sued the Trinity Refining Company in the district court, 126th judicial district, Travis county, to recover fines and penalties for violation of the conservation \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n laws. The court appointed Clopton and Hyder receivers of defendant's property pending the trial of the case. They took possession of property claimed by the defendant, including a large quantity of oil which the State insists had already become its property because unlawfully produced or transported. Later, the State sued the company in the district court, 98th judicial district of the same county, to recover delinquent taxes. That suit having been transferred to the district in which the first was pending, the court there appointed as receivers in the second case the same persons it had appointed in the first one.\n Within four months after commencement of the first suit, the company filed its petition in the United States District Court, submitting a plan of reorganization. The court found the petition to have been presented in good faith, approved it as properly filed, appointed Donoghue trustee of the debtor, directed him to take possession of its property, ordered that all persons having property of the debtor deliver it to him, and issued in usual form a restraining order preventing interference with his possession or control. The trustee took from the receivers property claimed by the debtor including the oil in question, approximately 77,000 barrels. Texas applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to bring suit in a state court to obtain judgment of confiscation against that oil. The court withheld consent and directed the trustee to retain the oil. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained that ruling, 88 F.2d 48, 51, and, to review its judgment upon that issue, we brought the case here. \n301 \nU.S. 674\n, 57 S.Ct. 795.7 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n The State's right to bring the suit in the state court is the same as if on its voluntary petition the company had been adjudged bankrupt on the day its petition for reorganization was approved. Section 77B(o), 11 U. S.C.A.  207(o). Forfeiture of unlawful oil under Texas law is a penalty imposed to vindicate the State's policy of conservation. Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 240\n, 241 S., 52 S.Ct. 559, 567, 86 A.L.R. 403. The bankruptcy court exercises jurisdiction under sovereignty that is independent of and foreign to that of Texas. Moore v. Mitchell, \n281 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 50 S.Ct. 175. It is without power to enforce penalties imposed by the State for violation of its laws. The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66, 123; Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265\n, 289, et seq., 8 S.Ct. 1370. Cf. section 57j, Bankruptcy Act;8 New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 44 S.Ct. 167, 168; United States v. Childs, \n266 \nU.S. 304, 309\n, 310 S., 45 S.Ct. 110, 111. The State's insistence is not that it is presently entitled to establish a right to forfeit the oil, but that the oil became its property when produced or transported contrary to law. It seeks not to forfeit but to enforce the forfeiture that resulted, as it maintains, immediately from unlawful production or transportation.\n Possession or control of the oil by the state court is not essential to its jurisdiction to entertain the suit proposed to be brought. \n9\n Texas does not claim to be entitled to possession of the oil until final adjudication in the state court. Retention by the trustee is not inconsistent with the maintenance of that suit. He is entitled there to be heard in support of his claim to the oil. If when the debtor's petition was approved the oil did not belong to Texas, the State was not entitled to have it withheld from the trustee. But, if by reason of unlawful production or transportation, the oil had already by forfeiture become \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 289]\n\u00a0\n the property of the State, the trustee was not entitled to take or retain it. If in a suit brought by Texas in a state court it should be determined that title to the oil had vested in the State before approval of the debtor's petition, the bankruptcy court doubtlessly will recognize that title and direct the trustee to hand over the oil or account for it to the State. Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch 241, 268; Hudson v. Guestier, 4 Cranch, 293, 297. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., supra, \n127 \nU.S. 265, 291\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370.\n The filing of the petition for reorganization in the bankruptcy court may not be held to deprive the State of opportunity in its own court to establish its claim that through forfeiture it had already become the owner of the oil for that would be to take the State's property for the benefit of the offending company or its creditors. Nor may the receivers' voluntary surrender of possession to the debtor's trustee prevent adjudication of the State's claim. The bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying the State's application for permission to institute proceedings in the state court and, to the extent that the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained that ruling, its judgment must be reversed. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Texas was not the owner of the oil in controversy when it came into the possession of the court of bankruptcy. If she had been such an owner, she could be heard in that court pro interesse suo, vindicating her title in reclamation proceedings like any other adverse claimant. By common consent ownership sufficient for such relief was not hers when the court of bankruptcy took the oil into its custody, and is not hers today. 'It is not correct to say, that property forfeited is vested in the government \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 290]\n\u00a0\n at the very moment of forfeiture, and the title of the owner immediately devested. On the contrary, the established doctrine is, that, notwithstanding the forfeiture, the property remains in the owner, until it is actually seized by the government, and then by the seizure the title of the government relates back to the time of the forfeiture.' Clark v. Protection Insurance Co., 1 Story 109, 134, Fed.Cas.No.2832; cf. United States v. Stowell, \n133 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S.Ct. 244. So far as I am aware there is no contention to the contrary. The oil 'shall be forfeited to the State as hereinafter provided' (Texas Revised Civil Statutes ( Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.) art. 6066a,  10), and not otherwise. The statute does not mean that without the aid of any judgment title is transferred at once on the commission of the offense. The judgment is to be in rem and imports control over the res. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, 734; Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & T. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734\n, 51 S.Ct. 270.\n With the oil in the possession of the federal court of bankruptcy-a possession lawfully acquired-leave to sue in the state court for a decree of forfeiture and sale will be an idle and empty form, productive of nothing except delay and vain expense, unless upon the pronouncement of the decree it will be the duty of the court of bankruptcy to surrender the oil to the court of another jurisdiction, and this for the sole purpose of making a forfeiture effective. I deny that any such duty will exist. Cf. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & T. Co., supra. I find no intimation of its existence in any case till this one. Certainly there is none in the cases now cited in the opinion of the court. True indeed it is that if possession of the res were to be acquired by the Texas court at the time of the decree of forfeiture or even at the time of a sale pursuant thereto, a title obtained thereunder would be recognized as valid everywhere. Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 291\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370; Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch 241; Hudson v. Guestier, 4 Cranch 293; Dicey, Conflict of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 284, 291]\n\u00a0\n Laws (5th Ed.) pp. 484, 485. This is far from saying that a court of another jurisdiction which already holds the res upon a trust for general creditors will give its possession up in aid of a forfeiture otherwise impossible. 'The courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.' The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66, 123; Gwin v. Breedlove, 2 How, 29, 37; Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., supra; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 666\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224 N.Y. 99, 102, 120 N.E. 198; Dicey, supra, p. 212. Cf. Bankruptcy Act,  57(j), 11 U.S.C.A.  93(j). Within the purview of that doctrine, the state and the federal courts are ranked as courts of separate sovereignties, quite as much as the courts of different states. Gwin v. Breedlove, supra; Moore v. Mitchell, \n281 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 50 S.Ct. 175. If the oil in controversy had been removed to California and were in possession of the receivers of a California corporation after a decree of dissolution, would any one contend that the California court would order its receivers to return the property to Texas for the purpose by such return of making a forfeiture effective? A federal court of bankruptcy is subject to no greater duty. The prevailing opinion commits us to a holding that property in one jurisdiction may be diverted from the use of creditors and made to feed a forfeiture in another jurisdiction, a forfeiture brutum fulmen unless thus aided from afar. If that is done, the efficacy of penal laws will have taken on a new extension. Without a transfer of possession the forfeiture is dead at birth. A court of bankruptcy will not stir a hand to make it viable.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice STONE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n302 \nU.S. 780\n, 58 S.Ct. 407, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C.  207 (11 U.S.C.A.  207). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Texas Revised Civil Statutes, 1925, title 102, as amended (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. tit. 102, art. 6004 et seq.). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. art. 6049e,  10. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Article 6036. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Article 6066a,  10:\n'(a) All unlawful oil ...

Elmer Brown, Jr., of Atlantic City, N.J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Murry C. Becker, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is one as to the power of a court of bankruptcy, in the situation developed in the record, to enjoin the prosecution of a suit in another federal court upon the ground that the suit, if passed to a decree, may thwart an inquiry into frauds charged against the bankrupt, or make relief against them difficult.\n William Fox was adjudicated a bankrupt on May 29, 1936, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. On the petition of two creditors an order \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n was made under section 21a of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.  44(a), 11 U. S.C.A.  44(a), for the examination of All Continent Corporation (a Delaware corporation), its president Eva Fox, who was also the bankrupt's wife, his daughters, and other witnesses. The wife refused to submit to examination, and was cited for contempt. When this record was made up, the proceeding to punish her was still undetermined. Meanwhile the examination proceeded with the aid of the witnesses responding to the order. After seventeen or more hearings the Referee made an order on August 18, 1936, whereby All Continent Corporation was directed to deliver all its books and records to the trustee in bankruptcy (petitioner in this court) for examination and audit. As a basis for the order, which was confirmed by the court with unimportant changes (In re Fox (D.C.) 16 F.Supp. 950), the referee certified the facts as they had been developed through the evidence before him. By this it appeared that All Continent Corporation was the creation of the bankrupt himself, who had supplied every dollar of its capital; that in doing this he had divested himself of a substantial portion of his property; that the entire capital stock, then claimed by his wife, had been kept in his name upon the corporate books; that he had retained in his possession and under his control the assets of the corporation, made up of securities, and had dealt with them on many occasions as if they were his own; that he held a power of attorney, broad in its terms, authorizing him to act for the corporation in the transaction of its business; that such books and records as were already in evidence disclosed disbursements for his account, discrepancies between the entries and those in his private books, and also erasures, corrections and interlineations affecting the scrutinized transactions, as well as sales to the corporation on the eve of bankruptcy. In the view of the Referee, this chain of facts, combined \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n with many others in the testimony before him, was proof 'that the affairs of the All Continent Corporation were so related to and intertwined with the property and affairs of the bankrupt' as to show the need for an exhaustive examination and audit of all the documents available.\n The enforcement of the order for the production of the books and records was stayed by the District Court until September 9, 1936. On that day the trustee was served in New Jersey with a subpoena and bill of complaint in a suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complainant named in the bill was the All Continent Corporation, which had already filed a proof of claim against Fox in the bankruptcy proceeding; the defendants were the members of the partnership of J. W. Sparks & Co., with whom were joined as absentee defendants, Capital Company, a corporation, and the petitioner in his capacity as trustee of the estate. The suit was brought under section 57 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  118 (28 U.S.C.A.  118)) to remove a cloud upon the title to personal property claimed by the complainant. The trustee not being 'an inhabitant of or found within' the district of the suit, an order directing him to plead was served upon him in New Jersey after the service of the bill. Judicial Code,  57, 28 U.S.C.  118 (28 U. S.C.A.  118). The cloud to be removed had its origin in a third party subpoena issued out of a federal court in New York in proceedings supplementary to judgment. Capital Company, a corporation, had recovered a judgment against Fox before he became bankrupt. A proceeding supplementary to judgment was begun, and we know from our records that Fox refused to appear and was fined for contempt. Fox v. Capital Company, \n299 \nU.S. 105\n, 57 S.Ct. 57. In aid of the same judgment, a third party subpoena was served upon Sparks & Co., stockbrokers residing in Philadelphia \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n and there engaged in business. These brokers had upon their books an account in the name of All Continent Corporation, in which Fox was believed to have an interest as owner. The securities held in that account had a value in excess of half a million dollars, subject to a debit balance. To enable the judgment creditor to reach any equity in those securities belonging to the debtor, the subpoena served upon the brokers was accompanied by a notice, which in effect was an injunction (New York Civil Practice Act  781), restraining them from disposing of the property of William Fox until the further order of the court. The validity of the injunction, though challenged by the brokers, was upheld upon appeal. Capital Co. v. Fox (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 97, 106 A.L.R. 376. Because of that restraint, Sparks & Co. refused to permit any securities to be withdrawn from their custody or otherwise disposed of, having notice of the claim that, irrespective of the form of the account, the securities belonged to Fox. Anxious to resume the control of the securities, All Continent Corporation sued in Pennsylvania to establish title to the res. Capital Company was stated in the bill to have created a cloud upon the title by issuing the third party subpoena with the accompanying injunction. The trustee in bankruptcy was stated to have helped to create the cloud by joining with Capital Company in a request that the subpoena be continued after the bankruptcy petition. Relief was demanded decreeing All Continent Corporation to be the owner of the securities and entitled to possession upon payment of the debit balance owing to the brokers.\n The trustee in bankruptcy upon service of the bill of complaint petitioned the court of bankruptcy that it stay the prosecution of the suit in Pennsylvania. The petition for a stay was granted. The opinion of the District Judge (In re Fox (D.C.) 16 F.Supp. 949, 950) states that a grave question has arisen as to the ownership of the assets and shares of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n All Continent Corporation. Litigation as to such ownership 'ought to be conducted by trustee after there has been a full and complete disclosure of the facts in the 21(a) examinations.' 'To require the trustee to appear and defend that suit (i.e., the suit in Pennsylvania) ... would interfere materially with proper administration.' Further prosecution against him was accordingly restrained.\n From that decree All Continent Corporation appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. By consent of the parties the court made an order including three additional documents in the transcript of the record: (1) The bill of complaint in a suit in the Court of Chancery in New Jersey; (2) an order to show cause for an injunction pendente lite and the appointment of a receiver; and (3) the answer of Sparks & Co. in the suit in Pennsylvania. The suit in the New Jersey Chancery was brought by the trustee in bankruptcy against the bankrupt William Fox, his wife, his daughters, his grandchildren, and the All Continent Corporation. The bill was filed within a week from the date of the restraining order. It charges fraud in the transfer of securities and other assets to the corporation at the time of its creation and also at later dates. It charges fraud in the assignment of the shares of the corporation by Fox to his wife, partly for her own benefit and partly for the benefit of children and grandchildren. It charges fraud in the opening of accounts with stockbrokers, ostensibly for the use of the corporation itself, but really for the use of Fox alone. All these transactions are stated to have occurred in execution of a unitary scheme, to which Fox, his wife and children and the corporation were parties in its several manifestations, for the hindrance of creditors in the enforcement of their rights and remedies. A decree is prayed enjoin- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 284]\n\u00a0\n ing the corporation from disposing of its assets, appointing a receiver to manage and preserve them during the pendency of the suit, annulling all the transfers tainted by the fraud, and decreeing a trust for the benefit of the bankrupt and through him for the trustee. Upon the filing of the bill the chancellor made an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, and he enjoined in the interim any transfer of the assets. One other document, as we have indicated, was added to the transcript. This was the answer of Sparks & Co. in the suit in Pennsylvania. In that answer they state the acceptance of securities from All Continent Corporation without notice that Fox or others had any interest therein; the existence of a debit balance of $308,764.97; the readiness of the customer to pay the debit balance on the return of the securities; and the hardship to the brokers involved in continuing the account with all the risks incidental to future changes in the market.\n Upon the record thus supplemented the Circuit Court of Appeals considered the appeal. In re Fox, 86 F.(2d) 913, 914. It said that 'the real question in issue here is whether or not the New Jersey court (i.e., the court of bankruptcy in New Jersey) had the power to enjoin the appellant from prosecuting its suit, under the facts in this case, in the Pennsylvania court.' It ruled that 'the Pennsylvania court, having first acquired jurisdiction of the property and controversy, is entitled to exclusive jurisdiction, and the institution of the suit in chancery was an attempt to oust the Pennsylvania court of the jurisdiction which it had previously and validly acquired.' It coupled that ruling with the statement that the corporation would be entitled 'upon proper application' to 'restrain the trustee from litigating the controversy elsewhere.' It found in the suit in the New Jersey Court of Chancery two separable controversies, one between the trustee ald All \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 285]\n\u00a0\n Continent Corporation, the other between the trustee and the members of the Fox family, the corporation being stated to be the only necessary party defendant to the first controversy and the Fox family the only necessary parties defendant to the other. It concluded that upon the facts exhibited 'the District Court of New Jersey did not have power to restrain the suit which the statute clearly authorized to be brought in the Pennsylvania court.' The decree of the court of bankruptcy was accordingly reversed. The question of power being important, we granted certiorari.\n All Continent Corporation, if there is truth in the charges made by the trustee, is a party to a conspiracy to cover up the bankrupt's assets and keep them from his creditors. In that view of the facts, the suit in Pennsylvania will be a step in fulfilling the conspiracy, and may even crown it with success. The inquiry into the fraud, an inquiry going forward in orderly fashion under the supervision of the court of bankruptcy, will be transferred to another jurisdiction with the supposed fraudulent grantee as dominus litis. In such a suit there is danger that the issues to be tried may be so narrowly restricted as to shut out the light. All Continent Corporation may be shown to have the legal title to the securities in the keeping of its brokers. If so, it may be adjudged in a controversy with the brokers to be entitled to possession, though its own shares are subject to a secret trust for the benefit of the bankrupt. There will be an absence of the parties without whom the adjudication of such a trust will be indecisive and perhaps impossible. If assignments of the shares have been made by the bankrupt to his wife for his own use or for hers or for the use of children and other relatives, the invalidity of such assignments may not be open to decision unless the assignees of the shares are brought before the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 286]\n\u00a0\n court. Choses in action and other equitable assets, even though fraudulently transferred, are not subject at cammon law to seizure under execution at the instance of a creditor, but the transfer must be avoided by a decree in equity. Stephens v. Cady, 14 How. 528, 531; Freedman's Savings & Trust Co. v. Earle, \n110 \nU.S. 710, 712\n, 4 S.Ct. 226; Authony v. Wood, 96 N.Y. 180, 185; American Surety Co. v. Conner, 251 N.Y. 1, 5, 6, 166 N.E. 783, 65 A.L.R. 244. The need for a decree is no less obvious and settled when title is to be reclaimed at the suit of a trustee. There are times, it is true, when a trustee may have the benefit of a summary order for transfer or surrender, but this will never happen as to property out of his possession unless the adverse claim of title is colorable only. Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426, 431\n, 433 S., 434, 44 S.Ct. 396, 398, 399; May v. Henderson, \n268 \nU.S. 111, 115\n, 45 S.Ct. 456, 458; Galbraith v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46, 50\n, 41 S.Ct. 415, 416; Taylor v. Sternberg, \n293 \nU.S. 470, 473\n, 55 S.Ct. 260, 262. Quite as much as any creditor, the trustee may thus be helpless to vindicate his equities in the suit in Pennsylvania, the parties being what they are. Other difficulties will remain if these can be surmounted. The bankrupt's wife may absent herself from the trial, just as she has refused to submit to examination in the bankruptcy proceeding, with the result that the investigation of the equities may be partial or abortive. Other witnesses may do the like. The danger of frustration by such means will be much greater in a suit by All Continent than in one by the trustee, an officer of the court. In the end a fraudulent grantee may gain possession of the securities with power to distribute them among the members of the bankrupt's family, and to do this, moreover, under cover of a decision which will breed confusion and uncertainty in other suits to follow.\n All these embarrassments and obstacles will be removed at a single stoke if the bankruptcy court is free from vexatious interference in its task of supervising and \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 287]\n\u00a0\n controlling the administration of the assets. The facts may then be uncovered without haste or impediment by continuing the examination under section 21a. A plenary suit may be brought with the trustee in control to ascertain the legal and the equitable interests in All Continent's assets and also in its shares of stock. All persons whose interests will be affected by an appropriate decree, and particularly the members of the bankrupt's family, adverse claimants to the shares, may be joined as defendants, as indeed they have been joined already in the New Jersey Court of Chancery. To avoid the fraudulent or improvident exercise of dominion by the holder of the legal title, an injunction may be granted restraining the transfer of the assets until the issues have been determined. To avoid loss or hardship either to stockbrokers or to others by tying up accounts without opportunity for release a receiver may be appointed with power to manage such accounts and preserve the assets generally. All these forms of relief and others ancillary thereto will be well within the powers of a court of equity if a suit is maintained in the name of the trustee with the corporation, the bankrupt and his family parties to the record. The suggestion will not hold that the controversy between the trustee and the corporation has no connection with the controversy between the trustee, the bankrupt and his relatives. Cf. Graves v. Corbin, \n132 \nU.S. 571\n, 10 S.Ct. 196. On the contrary, the remedy against the bankrupt and his relatives is likely to be truncated and inadequate unless accompanied by an injunction and a receivership which will bind the corporation, its officers and agents. The suit in the New Jersey Court of Chancery, which the court below has erroneously characterized as one that should be restrained because brought after notice of the suit in Pennsylvania, will supply an appropriate and convenient medium for the litigation of these issues if it is permitted to go forward. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 288]\n\u00a0\n The decision under review, which gives free rein to the prosecution of the suit in Pennsylvania, is built on the assumption that in the circumstances exhibited there is no power to apply a curb. The court has not found that discretion was abused or improvidently exercised if power was not lacking. This is plain from the opinion. It is made plainer, if that be possible, by the argument of counsel for the corporation, the respondent in this court, disclaiming any effort to upheld the decision in his favor in the absence of defect of power. With the controversy thus narrowed the path is cleared to a conclusion. For reasons already indicated there was probable cause for the belief that the suit in Pennsylvania would be a step in the execution of a fraudulent conspiracy, impeding and perhaps frustrating the administration of the assets. There was probable cause for the belief that only through a suit upon the lines of the one in the New Jersey Chancery could the danger of obstruction be averted and the estate be kept intact until the entry of a decree adjudging the guilt or innocence of the putative conspirators. Whether they are innocent or guilty is a question not before us now. The data for the formation of any opinion on the subject have not yet been supplied. At present our inquiry halts with the discovery of probable cause for preserving the estate from dismemberment or waste through a precipitate decision. If such cause has been made out, we think the court of bankruptcy has been armed with abundant power to preserve the status quo until there can be an adequate trial with all the necessary parties and a judgment on the merits.\n The Judicial Code provides (section 262, 28 U.S.C.  377 (28 U.S.C.A .  377)) that the United States courts 'shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 289]\n\u00a0\n The Bankruptcy Act reinforces that authority by providing (section 2(15), 11 U.S.C.  11(15), 11 U.S.C.A.  11(15) that courts of bankruptcy are invested with jurisdiction 'at law and in equity' to 'make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those specifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this title.' Referring to these statutes, this court has said that 'the power to issue an injunction when necessary to prevent the defeat or impairment of its jurisdiction is ... inherent in a court of bankruptcy, as it is in a duly established court of equity.' Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & P. Ry., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 675\n, 55 S.Ct. 595, 605. Cf. Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 240\n, 241 S., 54 S.Ct. 695, 697, 93 A.L.R. 195; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 229\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 81, 24 A.L.R. 1077; Looney v. Eastern Texas R.R. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 38 S.Ct. 460. Jurisdiction to administer the estate draws to itself, when once it has attached, an incidental or ancillary jurisdiction to give protection to the estate against waste or disintegration while frauds upon its integrity are in process of discovery. This power so obviously necessary to the attainment of the ends of justice has been exercised by the lower federal courts in a great variety of circumstances. There have been orders directing payment of moneys into the registry of the court until a plenary suit can be brought to recover them ( In re Mitchell (C.C.A.) 278 F. 707), restraining an adverse claimant from disposing of property in advance of a decree (In re Norris (D.C.) 177 F. 598; Pyle v. Texas Transport & Terminal Co. (D.C.) 185 F. 309), and enjoining possessory actions that might jeopardize relief in equity. In re Republic Plumbing Supply Co. (D.C.) 295 F. 573; cf. Blake v. Nesbet (D.C.) 144 F. 279; In re Blake (D.C.) 171 F. 298; In re Nathan Turim, Inc. (D.C.) 55 F.(2d) 672. If suits can be enjoined when they are found to have a tendency to embarrass administration, a fortiori this may be done when there is a basis for the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 290]\n\u00a0\n fear that they will be used as instruments or devices to render fraud triumphant. Not improbably the order in this case might better have imposed a condition that a plenary suit must be brought within a reasonable time. This defect, if it be one, is now of no importance, for by concession such a suit was brought within a week. There will be no occasion for delay if the corporation, the bankrupt and his family will coo perate in working for a quick decision. In such circumstances there can be no wrong or prejudice to All Continent by postponing its suit in Pennsylvania to a more comprehensive and efficient remedy that will put conflicting claims at rest. Cf. Wehrman v. Conklin, \n155 \nU.S. 314, 329\n, 15 S.Ct. 129. Delay and expedition will be subject to the control of equity. 'In that predicament the malleable processes of courts of bankruptcy give assurance of a remedy that can be moulded and adapted to the needs of the occasion.' Brown v. O'Keefe (March 29, 1937) \n300 \nU.S. 598\n, 57 S.Ct. 543, 547.\n Much of the argument for the respondent has been directed to a showing that the suit in Pennsylvania is not subject to restraint for defect of jurisdiction, and this for the reason that the res to be affected-the securities held by Sparks & Co. in their office in Philadelphia-had not come within the actual or constructive possession of the court of bankruptcy in New Jersey when the suit was begun to remove the cloud upon title. Cf. Fort Dearborn Trust & Savings Bank v. Smalley (C. C.A.) 298 F. 45; Molina v. Murphy (C.C.A.) 71 F.(2d) 605; In re Adolf Gobel, Inc. (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 849. The argument misconceives the grounds upon which the trustee looks to us for aid. The trustee does not challenge the jurisdiction of the federal court in Pennsylvania, if the word jurisdiction be taken in its strict and proper sense. Cf. Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318, 321\n, 51 S.Ct. 465, 466; Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734, 737\n, 738 S., 51 S.Ct. 270, 271, 272. He is not seeking a writ of prohibition directed \n\n[301 \nU.S. 278, 291]\n\u00a0\n to the court itself. He is not seeking an injunction to vindicate his exclusive control over a res in his possession, or in the possession, actual or constructive, of the court that appointed him. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., supra; Murphy v. John Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562, 568\n, 569 S., 29 S.Ct. 154; Moran v. Sturges, \n154 \nU.S. 256, 274\n, 14 S.Ct. 1019. What he seeks is an injunction directed to a suitor, and not to any court, upon the ground that the suitor is misusing a jurisdiction which by hypothesis exists, and converting it by such misuse into an instrument of wrong. Gage v. Riverside Trust Co. (C.C.) 86 F. 984, 998, 999; Higgins v. California Prune & Apricot Growers (C.C.A.) 282 F. 550, 557; Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107, 112\n, 117 S., 118, 10 S.Ct. 269. Suits as well as transfers may be the protective coverings of fraud. Shapiro v. Wilgus, \n287 \nU.S. 348, 355\n, 53 S.Ct. 142, 144, 85 A.L.R. 128. We are unable to yield assent to the statement of the court below that 'the restraint of a proper party is legally tantamount to the restraint of the court itself.' The reality of the distinction has illustration in a host of cases. 2 Story, Eq.Jur. (14th Ed.)  1195; 5 Pomeroy, Eq.Jur.  2091; Cole v. Cunningham, supra; Madisonville Traction Co. v.

OF SMITHSBURG, MD. V.(1937)\nNo. 298\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n  Appeals from the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland. [ Stockholders of Ppl. Banking Co. of Smithsburg, Md. v. Sterling   \n300 \nU.S. 175\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 176]\n\u00a0\n\n  Messrs. Charles F. Wagaman, John Wagaman, and Harvey R. Spessard, all of Hagerstown, Md., for appellants.\n  Messrs. William H. Bovey and R. H. McCauley, both of Hagerstown, Md., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Stockholders in banking corporations, charged with personal liability, contend that a statute of Maryland defining the form of liability and its measure offends against the Constitution of the United States by impairing the obligation of contracts previously made. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 177]\n\u00a0\n  In No. 298, the liability in controversy is that of stockholders in the Peoples Banking Company of Smithsburg, which was incorporated under the laws of Maryland, January 24, 1910, and closed its doors June 29, 1931. The bank commissioner of the state, after being appointed receiveer, filed a petition with a circuit court in Maryland for an order assessing the stockholders of record in an amount equal to 100 per cent. of the par value of their shares. An order was made accordingly in conformity with the provisions of Acts 1910, c. 219 (Code of Maryland, art. 11,  72). Thereafter the appellants filed petitions for the revocation of the order, alleging the invalidity of the statute imposing liability, and alleging also that those of them who had paid the assessments before joining in the petitions had done so by mistake. At the date of liquidation appellants were the holders of over 2,000 shares of stock. Thirteen appellants had become the holders of a relatively small portion of these shares (345) before the enactment of the applicable statute. Nearly all the appellants were depositors in the insolvent bank and were thus creditors as well as stockholders. The circuit court for Washington county, Md., granted the petitions, holding the statute void as an impairment of existing contracts. The Court of Appeals reversed, and adjudged the statute valid. Ghingher v. Bachtell, 169 Md. 678, 182 A. 558. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  237, as amended, 28 \nU.S.C.  344 (28 \nU.S.C.A.  344).\n  In No. 299, the liability in controversy is that of stockholders in the Hagerstown Bank & Trust Company, which was incorporated in 1902. The trust company was closed in February, 1933, and in January, 1935, an order was made for the assessment of all the stockholders to the extent of 100 per cent. of the par value of their shares, provided that no good cause was shown to the contrary within a stated time. The appellants in this case, unlike some of the appellants in No. 298, acquired \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 178]\n\u00a0\n their shares after the enactment of the 1910 statute. Even so, they appeared within the time limit in opposition to the assessment, asserting that the statute was invalid as to them. The circuit court of Washington county sustained their opposition, and the Court of Appeals reversed. Ghingher v. Kausler, 169 Md. 696, 182 A. 566. In this case also the controversy is here upon appeal.\n  The questions in the two cases will be considered separately.\nFirst: The case of the Peoples Banking Company of Smithsburg.\n  The Constitution of Maryland provides that 'the General Assembly shall grant no charter for Banking purposes * * * except upon the condition that the Stockholders shall be liable to the amount of their respective share or shares of stock in such Banking Institution, for all its debts and liabilities upon note, bill or otherwise.' Maryland Constitution 1867, art. 3,  39. This provision was effective without more to impose a substantive liability upon stockholders in banks. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra, 169 Md. 678, at pages 688, 690, 182 A. 558. On the other hand, it did not take from the Legislature the power to implement the liability with statutory remedies, nor, in the absence of such statutes, did it take that power from the courts. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra. In January, 1910, when the Smithsburg bank was organized, the only applicable statute was chapter 206 of the Acts of 1870. The act shows by its title that it is one 'to create State Banking Institutions to enable the several Banks in this State-State and National-to avail of the provisions thereof.' It provides (section 11) that 'the continuance of the said several corporations shall be on the condition that the stockholders and directors of each of said corporations shall be liable to the amount of their respective share or shares of stock in such corporation, for all its debts and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 179]\n\u00a0\n liabilities upon note, bill or otherwise; and upon this further condition, that this Act and every part of it may be altered from time to time, or repealed by the Legislature.' The Maryland courts have held in a series of decisions that the liability thus recognized was not enforceable by the bank itself in the event of its insolvency, or by a inquidator or receiver suing in its behalf. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra; Miners' Bank v. Snyder, 100 Md. 57, 67, 59 A. 707, 68 L.R.A. 312, 108 Am.St.Rep. 390; Colton v. Mayer, 90 Md. 711, 714, 45 A. 874, 47 L.R.A. 617, 78 Am.St.Rep. 456. The right of action was no part of the assets of the insolvent corporation. The meaning of the statute was thought to be that every creditor of the corporation in assuming that relation acquired for his individual use, and not as a class representative, a supplemental right of action against the holders of the shares. To rationalize this right of action, it was said to rest upon an implied contract between the creditor on the one side and on the other the holders of the shares at the creation of the debt. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra. Contract being the basis of the statutory remedy, the courts deduced the consequence that the liability did not extend to stockholders who became such after the debt was in existence. For the same reason any stockholder was free to reduce his liability by the use of set- offs or counterclaims available at the time of suit against the primary obligor. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra, 169 Md. 678, at page 694, 182 A. 558; Cahill v. Original Big Gun Association, 94 Md. 353, 50 A. 1044, 89 Am.St. Rep. 434.\n  In June, 1910, less than five months after the incorporation of this bank, a statute was enacted, abrogating the remedy under the then existing statute and substituting another. Acts 1910, c. 219, Maryland Code, art. 11,  72: 'Stockholders of every bank and trust company shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts and engagements of every such corporation, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 180]\n\u00a0\n value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such stock * * * and the liability of such stockholders shall be an asset of the corporation for the benefit ratably of all the depositors and creditors of any such corporation, if necessary to pay the debts of such corporation, and shall be enforceable only by appropriate proceedings by a receiver, assignee or trustee of such corporation acting under the orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.' A like remedy had previously been created against stockholders in trust companies. Acts 1904, c. 101; Acts 1908, c. 153, p. 60. Through these amendatory acts, the cause of action formerly enforceable by the creditors separately, each suing for himself, became enforceable by the receiver as the representative of all. As a consequence of the new procedure, the assessment was to be laid upon all the holders of shares at the time of liquidation without reference to their relaton to the bank at the creation of the debts, though stockholders dropping out sooner might escape a liability which under the earlier law would have clung to them indefinitely. Moreover, offsets and counterclaims were no longer to be available to reduce the several assessments and thus establish inequality. Stockholders when sued by the receiver would contribute to the fund ratably, and then prove their claims against the bank in the same way as other creditors. Such in outline is the effect of the statutory changes as the highest court of Maryland has defined them in this very case.\n  Do changes of that order impair the obligation of a contract between the corporation and the stockholders in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States?\n  The answer must be 'no,' and this for two reasons, first, because the changes are directed to the implementing remedies rather than the substantive liability, and, second, because a change of substantive liability was \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 181]\n\u00a0\n made permissible by the reservation of a power of alternation or repeal.\n  The obligation laid upon the shareholders by the Maryland Constitution, though susceptible of legislative and judicial regulation in respect of the mode of its enforcement, was a substantive liability to which every stockholder subjected himself upon the acquisition of his stock. The Legislature did not exhaust the measure of that constitutional liability by the creation of a particular remedial device. The remedy adopted was interpreted judicially as having in view a suit by a creditor against the particular group of stockholders who had undertaken by implication to answer for his debt. This does not mean that a different form of remedy, for example a suit by a receiver, would have been a departure from the Constitution, if the statute had prescribed that method of enforcement. The broad but indefinite words of the constitutional command gave permission to the Legislature to establish any remedies reasonably appropriate to the general end in view. Cf. Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559, 562\n; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n. So, the broad but indefinite words of the legislation first adopted, the act of 1870, gave freedom to the courts to develop through the process of construction a cause of action enforceable at the instance of a creditor without asserting in so doing that a different cause of action, enforceable through a receiver, would have been an inappropriate implement of the constitutional liability, in the event that the Legislature or the courts had chosen to adopt it. Stockholders who became such while the first statute was in force were chargeable with notice that a new remedy might be adopted if the one first chosen was inadequate. They would have been chargeable with such notice though nothing had been said. They were chargeable, as it happens, by the wording of the statute, the charter being \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 182]\n\u00a0\n granted upon the condition that the act or any part of it might be altered or repealed.\n  The remedy first established was found to be unworkable. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra, 169 Md. 678, at page 692, 182 A. 558; Murphy v. Wheatley, 102 Md. 501, 515, 63 A. 62. Still acting within the limits of the constitutional command, the Legislature of Maryland announced another remedy, less unwieldy and confusing. In the view of the state court, the substantive liability as the Constitution had created it was the same under the new procedure as it had been from the beginning. Ghingher v. Bachtell, supra. The court was far from holding that the statute had enlarged it. What had happened was merely this, that another remedy had been established to implement a liability created long ago. Cf. Pittsburg Steel Co. v. Baltimore Equitable Society, \n226 \nU.S. 455\n; Hill v. Merchants' Mutual Ins. Co., \n134 \nU.S. 515\n; Fourth National Bank v. Francklyn, \n120 \nU.S. 747, 755\n; Shriver v. Woodbine Savings Bank, \n285 \nU.S. 467, 474\n, 479, 432, 434. We cannot see in this an attempt to lay upon the stockholders by force of later legislation a new and different burden from that accepted at the outset. Nor would it help the appellants anything to assume in their behalf that the Constitution of the State has been given a new meaning, if the new meaning is not due to the compulsion of a statute. Change by judicial construction of antecedent legislation does not impair a contract, at least in the forbidden sense, if it be granted arguendo that such a change can be discovered. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, \n263 \nU.S. 444, 450\n, 198; Fleming v. Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 247; Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 680\n, 454; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 364\n, 148, 85 A.L.R. 254. The new meaning, if there is any, is not ascribed to the Constitution because a later statute has said it must be done. The new meaning is the product of the independent judg- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 183]\n\u00a0\n ment of a court. So the state court told us, and the good faith of its declaration is not successfully impeached. Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 402. To changes thus wrought the Constitution of the United States does not offer an impediment.\n  The result would not be different if the effect of the statutory amendments were to be viewed as an enlargement of the substantive liability for debts afterwards contracted, the enlargement being applicable to stockholders without exception, present as well as future. The charter was accepted subject to the condition that the personal liability then prescribed by statute should be subject thereafter to repeal or alternation. This Court has held that, when such a condition attaches to a charter, there is no unconstitutional change of the obligation of a contract by a subsequent enlargement of the liability of stockholders as to debts afterwards contracted, though the shares so affected were acquired before the change was made. Sherman v. Smith, 1 Black, 587, affirming In re Gibson, 21 N.Y. 9; Looker v. Maynard, \n179 \nU.S. 46, 53\n; cf. McGowan v. McDonald, 111 Cal. 57, 66, 43 P. 418, 52 Am.St.Rep. 149; Perkins v. Coffin, 84 Conn. 275, 295, 79 A. 1070, Ann.Cas.1912C, 1188; Pate v. Bank of Newton, 116 Miss. 666, 686, 77 So. 601. Stockholders who subscribe to stock subject to such a condition assume the risk that their relation to the corporation may be altered to their prejudice. Nor is their position any stronger because the new liability is heavier (if so it be assumed to be) than that imposed upon them directly by the Constitution of the State. The constitutional liability is not a maximum, but a minimum, and the Legislature does not transcend the bounds of legislative power by increasing it thereafter. Murphy v. Wheatley, supra, 102 Md. 501, at page 514, 515, 516, 63 A. 62; Davis v. Moore, 130 Ark. 128, 135, 197 S.W. 295; Parker v. Carolina Savings Bank, 53 S.C. 583, 592, 31 S.E. 673, 69 Am.St. Rep. 888; Duke v. Force, 120 Wash. 599, 606, 208 P. 67, 23 A.L.R. 1354. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 184]\n\u00a0\n  Sherman v. Smith, supra, left unanswered an inquiry (1 Black, 587, at page 594) whether the amendment would have gone too far if it had been made applicable to debts existing at the date of its enactment as well as to existing stockholders. We may leave the question open now. Appellants have failed to show that any debts of the corporation to be enforced in these proceedings were debts existing on June 1, 1910, when the present statute became law, still less that the subtraction of those debts would have made the assessment lower than the par value of the shares. The extent of the deficiency is persuasive, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the assessment must have been the same if the old debts had been disregarded. Such of them as exist must have been contracted in the brief interval between January 24, 1910, and June 1 following. At all events, the burden was on the appellants to show themselves harmed through the operation of the statute challenged as unlawful. Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, \n298 \nU.S. 226, 227\n, 755; People of State of New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 161, 9 Ann.Cas. 736. This they have not done. As to debts to be contracted afterwards, if not also as to others, the statute is impregnable.\n  What has been written is not at war with anything decided or even intimated in Coombes v. Getz, \n285 \nU.S. 434, 441\n, 442, 436, much relied on by appellants. There creditors were complaining of the destruction of a cause of action whereby they were left without a remedy. Here the record does not tell us that any creditors who were such when the first statute was repealed have claims still outstanding for debts contracted then. In the usual course of business deposits made so long ago must almost certainly have been paid through the application of the principle that the first drawings out are to be attributed to the first payments in. Carson v. Federal Reserve Bank, 254 N. Y. 218, 232, 172 N.E. 475, 70 A.L.R. 435. At \n\n[300 \nU.S. 175\n, 185]\n\u00a0\n any rate, there is nothing to the contrary in the pages of this record. The fact is thus apparent that the contract rights of creditors are not involved at all. Whatever complaint is heard as to the substitution of a new remedy in 1910 is not from creditors of that date, unable to collect their debts. The complaint comes to us from stockholders, who took their stock with notice that the remedies against them might be changed from time to time. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n  As already pointed out, all the complaining stockholders in this company acquired their shares after the adoption of the act of 1910, with its new remedial devices. What has been said as to the stockholders in the Peoples Banking Company of Smithsburg applies with redoubled force to the stockholders in the trust company.\n  The decree in each case should be\n  Affirmed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The authority of a state under the socalled reserved power is wide; but is not unlimited.

WHITE(1937)\nNo. 202\nArgued: April 29, 1937Decided: May 24, 1937\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing Oct. 11, 1937\n\n\n Mr. Thomas Allen, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Paul Jackson, of Norfolk, Va., for respondent. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the petitioners, testamentary trustees, who have paid a tax on the income of the trust estate, which should have been paid by the beneficiary, are entitled to recover the tax, although the government's claim against the beneficiary has been barred by the statute of limitations. The present suit to recover the tax, brought by petitioners against respondent, the Collector, in the District Court for Massachusetts, resulted in a judgment for petitioners, 8 F.Supp. 354, which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, 78 F.(2d) 136. We granted certiorari, \n300 \nU.S. 643\n, 57 S.Ct. 610, 81 L.Ed . --, because of the conflict of the decision below with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, United States v. Arnold, 89 F.(2d) 246.\n Testator, by his will, left property in trust, to pay over the net income to his wife as sole beneficiary, at such times and in such amounts as she should deem best, during her natural life. She elected to take the bequest under the will in lieu of her dower or statutory interest. At that time several circuit courts of appeals had held that in these circumstances, the income payments to the widow are annuities purchased by surrender of the dower interest and not taxable as income to her, until they equal the value of the dower interest. Warner v. Walsh (D.C.) 15 F.( 2d) 367; United States v. Bolster (C.C.A.) 26 F. (2d) 760, 59 A.L.R. 491; Allen v. Brandeis (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 363. In conformity to the ruling of these decisions, the beneficiary did not include, in her 1928 tax return, any portion of the income received by her from the trust. A deficiency against the trustees was assessed by the Commissioner before, and was paid by them, under protest, from income of the trust, after collection from the beneficiary had been barred by the statute of limitations. After the statute had run, this Court held in Helvering v. Butterworth, \n290 \nU.S. 365\n, 54 S.Ct. 221 (interpreting section 219, Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n 253, 275, corresponding to sections 161, 162 of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 838 (26 U.S.C.A.  161, 162, and notes), under which the present tax was assessed), that the income was taxable to the beneficiary and not to the trustees.\n In the present suit, brought by the trustees to recover the tax as erroneously collected, the Collector interposed the defense, sustained by the court below, that the tax which should have been paid by the beneficiary exceeded that paid by petitioners, and that, as any recovery would inure to the advantage of the beneficiary, the defendant could set off the tax debt due from her. One judge concurred, denying the right of set off in view of the bar of the statute, but holding the petitioners not entitled, in equity and good conscience, to recover.\n The action, brought to recover a tax erroneously paid, although an action at law, is equitable in its function. It is the lineal successor of the common count in indebitatus assumpsit for money had and received. Originally an action for the recovery of debt, favored because more convenient and flexible than the common law action of debt, it has been gradually expanded as a medium for recovery upon every form of quasi- contractual obligation in which the duty to pay money is imposed by law, independently of contract, express or implied in fact. Ames, The History of Assumpsit, 2 Harv.L.Rev. 53; Woodward, Law of Quasi-Contracts,  2.\n Its use to recover upon rights equitable in nature to avoid unjust enrichment by the defendant at the expense of the plaintiff, and its control in every case by equitable principles, established by Lord Mansfield in Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1005 (K.B. 1750), have long been recognized in this Court. See Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689, 702; Gaines v. Miller, \n111 \nU.S. 395, 397\n, 4 S.Ct. 426; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, \n295 \nU.S. 301, 309\n, 55 S.Ct. 713, 716. It is an appropriate remedy for the recovery of taxes erroneously collected, Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 156; Cary v. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 535]\n\u00a0\n Curtis, 3 How. 236, 246-250. The statutes authorizing tax refunds and suits for their recovery are predicated upon the same equitable principles that underlie an action in assumpsit for money had and received. United States v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n291 \nU.S. 386, 402\n, 54 S.Ct. 443, 449. Since, in this type of action, the plaintiff must recover by virtue of a right measured by equitable standards, it follows that it is open to the defendant to show any state of facts which, according to those standards, would deny the right, Moses v. Macferlan, supra, 2 Burr. 1005, at page 1010; Myers v. Hurley Motor Co., \n273 \nU.S. 18, 24\n, 47 S.Ct. 277, 278, 50 A.L.R. 1181; cf. Winchester v. Hackley, 2 Cranch 342, even without resort to the modern statutory authority for pleading equitable defenses in actions which are more strictly legal, Jud.Code,  274b, 28 U.S.C.  398 (28 U.S.C. A.  398).\n In the present case it is evident that but a single tax was due upon the particular income assessed and that petitioners' demand arises from the circumstance that the tax was paid from the income by the trustees when it should have been paid by the beneficiary. If the court may have regard to the fact that so far as the equitable rights of the parties are concerned petitioners, in seeking recovery of the tax, are acting for the account of the beneficiary, it would seem clear that the case is not one in which the petitioners are entitled to recover ex equo et bono; for under the construction of the will by the court below, which we adopt, any recovery in this action will be income to the beneficiary, and will deprive the government of a tax to which it is justly entitled and enable the beneficiary to escape a tax which she should have paid.\n It is said that as the revenue laws treat the trustee and the beneficiary as distinct tax-paying entities, a court of equity must shut its eyes to the fact that in the realm of reality it was the beneficiary's money which paid the tax and it is her money which the petitioners ask the government to return. Formerly, trustee and cestui que trust \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n were likewise distinct in the eyes of the law, as they are today for many purposes. But whenever the trustee brings suit in a court which is free to consider equitable rights and duties, his right to maintain the suit may be enlarged or diminished by reference to the fact that the suit, though maintained in the name of the trustee alone, is for the benefit and in the equitable interest of the cestui.\n He can sue to set aside his own voluntary conveyance and impeach it as a breach of trust known to the transferee, because the action, brought to recover property for the trust estate, will inure to the advantage of the innocent beneficiary. Wetmore v. Porter, 92 N.Y. 76; Zimmerman v. Kinkle, 108 N.Y. 282, 15 N.E. 407; Atwood v. Lester, 20 R.I. 660, 665, particularly at page 669, 40 A. 866, 868-870; Franco v. Franco, 3 Ves.Jr. 75; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts,  294.1 His suit to recover a debt due him as trustee, and payable by him over to the cestui, is subject to the equitable defense that the cestui has discharged the claim, McBride v. Wright, 46 Mich. 265, 9 N.W. 275 (Cooley, J.); Smith v. Brown, 5 Rich.Eq.(S.C.) 291; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts,  328. That the cestui owes a like amount can be shown by way of equitable plea in set-off, Campbell v. Hamilton, Fed.Cas.No.2,359; Waddle v. Harbeck, 33 Ind. 231, 234; Ward v. Martin, 3 T.B.Mon(19 Ky.) 18; Driggs v. Rockwell, 11 Wend.(N.Y.) 504, 508; Wolf v. Beales, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 537]\n\u00a0\n 6 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 242, 243, 9 Am.Dec. 425; Agra and Masterman's Bank, Ltd. v. Leighton, L.R. 2 Ex. 56, 65; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Trusts,  329. In an action in general assumpsit, this defense may be shown under the plea of non assumpsit, compare Winchester v. Hackley, supra.\n In such cases equity does not countenance the idle ceremony of allowing recovery by the trustee only to compel him to account to the beneficiary who would then have to pay the proceeds to the original defendant. To avoid this circuity of action a court of equity takes cognizance of the identity in interest of trustee and cestui que trust. Likewise here, the fact that the petitioners and their beneficiary must be regarded as distinct legal entities for purposes of the assessment and collection of taxes does not deprive the court of its equity powers or alter the equitable principles which govern the type of action which petitioners have chosen for the assertion of their claim.\n Equitable conceptions of justice compel the conclusion that the retention of the tax money would not result in any unjust enrichment of the government. All agree that a tax on the income should be paid, and that if the trustees are permitted to recover no one will pay it. It is in the public interest that no one should be permitted to avoid his just share of the tax burden except by positive command of law, which is lacking here. No injustice is done to the trustees or the beneficiary by withholding from the trustees money which in equity is the beneficiary's, and which the government received in payment of a tax which was hers to pay. A single error on the part of the taxing authorities, excusable in view of persistent judicial declarations, has caused both the underassessment of one taxpayer and the overassessment of the other. But the error has not increased the tax burden of either, for whether the tax is paid by one or the other, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 538]\n\u00a0\n its source is the fund which should pay the tax, and only the equitable owner of the fund is ultimately burdened. Cf. United States Paper Ass'n v. Bowers (C.C.A.) 80 F.(2d) 82. Since in equity the one taxpayer represents and acts for the other, it is not for either to complain that the government has taken from one with its right hand, when it has, because of the same error, given to the other with its left.\n Petitioners contend that recovery is precluded by section 275(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 U.S.C.A.  275 note), which bars a 'proceeding in court ... for the collection' of a tax after the prescribed period, and by sections 607, 609 (26 U.S.C.A.  1670(a)(2), 1675 and note), which are said to prohibit 'credit of an overpayment against a barred deficiency.' Section 607 provides that any tax assessed or paid after the expiration of the period of limitation shall be considered an overpayment, and section 609 declares that a credit against a liability, in respect of any taxable year, shall be void 'if any payment in respect of such liability would be considered an overpayment under section 607 (section 1670(a)(2)).'\n These provisions limit the collection of a tax, and prevent the retention of one paid after it is barred by the statute. They preclude, in a suit by the taxpayer against the collector or the government, reliance on a claim against the taxpayer, barred by statute, as a set-off, or counterclaim. But the demand made upon the trustees was not barred by limitation and it would be an unreasonable construction of the statute, not called for by its words, to hold that it is intended to deprive the government of defenses based on special equities establishing its right to withhold a refund from the demanding taxpayer. The statute does not override a defense based on the estoppel of the taxpayer. R. H. Stearns Company v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 54, 61\n, 62 S., 54 S.Ct. 325, 328. The statutory bar to the right of action for the collection of the tax does not prevent reliance upon a defense which is not a set-off or a counterclaim, but is an equitable reason, growing out of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n the circumstances of the erroneous payment, why petitioners ought not to recover.\n Here the defense is not a counter demand on petitioners, but a denial of their equitable right to undo a payment which, though effected by an erroneous procedure, has resulted in no unjust enrichment to the government, and in no injury to petitioners or their beneficiary. The government, by retaining the tax paid by the trustees, is not reviving a stale claim. Its defense, which inheres in the cause of action is comparable to an equitable recoupment or diminution of petitioners' right to recover. 'Such a defense is never barred by the statute of limitations so long as the main action itself is timely.' Bull v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 247, 262\n, 55 S.Ct. 695, 700; Williams v. Neely (C.C.A.) 134 F. 1, 13, 69 L.R.A. 232.2 Compare United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 16, 17; United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 163, 164, where equitable recoupment against a claim by the government was allowed notwithstanding the immunity of the government from suit.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It has been held that in such a suit equity will not permit the grantee to set up the statute of limitations ordinarily applicable to a suit by the trustee if the trustee can show that the beneficiary, because of ignorance of the breach of trust or because of disability, would not have been barred by laches had he brought suit directly.

Or to pay $80,000 if his death results from accidental bodily injury, 'all upon the conditions set forth in Section 1.' 'And if the Insured is totally and presumably permanently disabled before age 60, will pay to the Insured $400.00 monthly during such disability, increasing after five and ten years continuous disability, besides waiving premium payments, all upon the conditions set forth in Section 3.'\n  The policy is a long and complicated document. It incorporates the application and the medical examiner's report.\n  Section 1 (two printed pages) relates to the 'Double Indemnity' obligation. It defines the injury to which the insurance applies, specifies the necessary proof, optional modes of settlement, etc.\n  Section 3-'Benefits in Event of Total and Permanent Disability before Age 60,' is in the margin. \n1\n It defines \n\n[300 \nU.S. 435\n, 437]\n\u00a0\n total and permanent disability; states when benefits will become effective; what they shall be; when premiums will be waived. Also specifies what will be considered permanent disability, when proofs may be demanded, etc. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 435\n, 438]\n\u00a0\n And provides: 'Disability Benefits shall not be granted if disability is the result of self-inflicted injury. The provision for Disability Benefits shall automatically terminate if the Insured shall at any time, voluntarily or involuntarily engage in military or naval service in time of war outside of the continental limits of the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada.' Other provisions relate to termination of such benefits, reduction of premiums thereafter, etc.\n  Neither section 1 nor 3 contains anything relative to fraud in obtaining the policy or the effect of false statements in the application.\n  Section 14-'Miscellaneous Provisions' (two pages) contains the following paragraph: 'Incontestability.-Except for non-payment of premiums and except for the restrictions and provisions applying to the Double Indemnity and Disability Benefits as provided in Sections 1 and 3 respectively, this Policy shall be incontestable after one year from its date of issue unless the Insured dies in such year, in which event it shall be incontestable after two years from its date of issue.'\n  In October, 1932, respondent filed a bill (afterwards amended) against Stroehmann, the insured, and the beneficiary in the United States District Court, Middle District, Pennsylvania. It alleged that the policy had been obtained upon false and fraudulent misrepresentations and concealments material to the risk. It asked \n\n[300 \nU.S. 435\n, 439]\n\u00a0\n that the disability benefits provisions be canceled, also for an injunction against suit at law upon them.\n  Relying upon the incontestability clause, the petitioner moved that the bill be dismissed. The trial court sustained the motion, holding that as more than a year had elapsed since the policy took effect, the limitation was applicable and controlling. The Circuit Court of Appeals thought otherwise and reversed the challenged decree. 86 F.(2d) 47.\n  The matter is here by certiorari limited to the question of the application and effect of the incontestability clause.\n  No reason appears to doubt the power of the insurer to except from the ordinary incontestability clause all policy provisions relating to disability benefits. Chapter 28, Laws N.Y.1923 (Insurance Law (Consol.Laws, c. 28),  101); Steinberg v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 263 N.Y. 45, 188 N.E. 152, 90 A.L.R. 542. But the petitioner maintains that the words used in the policy before us are inadequate definitely to disclose a purpose so to do. And we think the point is well taken.\n  In Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Hurni Packing Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 91, 31 A.L.R. 102, this Court said: 'The rule is settled that in case of ambiguity that construction of the policy will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured. The language employed is that of the company and it is consistent with both reason and justice that any fair doubt as to the meaning of its own words should be resolved against it.' See Royal Insurance Co. v. Martin, \n192 \nU.S. 149, 162\n, 165; Bergholm et al. v. Peoria Life Ins. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 489, 492\n, 231.\n  Examination of the words relied upon to show an exception to the incontestability clause of the policy discloses ample cause for doubt concerning their meaning. The arguments of counsel have emphasized the uncertainty. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals reached different conclusions, and elsewhere there is diversity of opinion. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 435\n, 440]\n\u00a0\n  The District Court accepted the view approved in Ness v.

Ninth Circuit) 78 F.(2d) 396, which presented for interpretation language identical with that now before us. The Circuit Court of Appeals followed its earlier opinion in N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Gatti, -- F. (2d) -- (Oct. 6, 1936),1 where the company employed different language. Certain life companies undertake to make exceptions to the incontestability clause by words more precise than those now under consideration, and opinions in cases arising upon their policies must be appraised accordingly.\n  Without difficulty respondent could have expressed in plain words the exception for which it now contends. It has failed, we think, so to do. And applying the settled rule, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the resulting doubt.\n  The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The decree of the District Court is affirmed.\n  Reversed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 3.Benefits in Event of Total and Permanent Disability before Age 60.\n'Total Disability.Disability shall be considered total when there is any impairment of mind or body which continuously renders it impossible for the Insured to follow a gainful occupation.\n\n'Permanent Disability.Total disability shall, during its continuance, be presumed to be permanent;\n\n'(a) If such disability is the result of conditions which render it reasonably certain that such disability will continue during the remaining lifetime of the Insured; or,\n\n'(b) If such disability has existed continuously for ninety days.\n\n'When Benefits become Effective.If, before attaining the age of sixty years and while no premium on this Policy is in default, the Insured shall furnish to the Company due proof that he is totally and permanently disabled, as defined above, the Company will grant the following benefits during the remaining lifetime of the Insured so long as such disability continues.\n\n'Benefits.

Clegg, of Fairbanks, Alaska, for respondent.\n[ Sumi v. Young   \n300 \nU.S. 251\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 251\n, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In the Probate Court, Fairbanks, Alaska, October, 1934, a contest arose over the appointment of a guardian for two minor children. Petitioner's application failed. Respondent was designated. The District Court heard the matter de novo and approved this action.\n  Upon motion, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The motion averred: (1) The cause involves no question arising under the Constitution, statute, or treaty of the United States, or any authority exercised thereunder; (2) no monetary value exceeding $1,000 is involved; (3) the petitioner was not a party in the Probate Court. Section 128, Judicial Code,1 also section 943, Act of June 6, 1900,2 were relied upon in opposition. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 251\n, 253]\n\u00a0\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals could find no question under the Constitution, statute or treaty of the United States, or authority exercised thereunder; nor any controversy concerning money, property, or property rights. It concluded that section 128, Judicial Code, gave no jurisdiction; also that section 943, Act June 6, 1900, confers none since it only directs that orders of the District Court of Alaska in probate cases shall be deemed judgments subject to appeal as provided by section 128.\n  The petitioner insists that the cause involves construction and application of several sections Alaska Civil Code,3 and that jurisdiction is conferred by section 128; also that section 943, Act June 6, 1900, is applicable.\n  Considering Summers v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 92\n, we cannot regard provisions of the Alaska Civil Code as laws of the United States within the intendment of section 128. They are special or local laws designed to meet conditions peculiar to that Territory. It follows that this section does not authorize the appeal under consideration. This view is aided by the words 'in all other civil cases wherein the value in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds $ 1,000 * * * and in all habeas corpus proceedings.' If every case arising under the Civil Code involves a statute of the United States, this clause is inappropriate.\n  Moreover, to bring within the appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals every order of the District Court of Alaska concerning guardianship claims against estates, distributions, etc., would hinder the manifest pur- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 251\n, 254]\n\u00a0\n pose to limit and definitely establish the jurisdiction of that court disclosed by Judicial Code 1911, and the amending Act of 1925. The Alaska Civil Code is an elaborate Act of Congress-230 printed pages-which undertakes to prescribe the law on a great many subjects.\n  The provision of section 943, Act of June 6, 1900, applicable to appeals in probate cases in Alaska, appears in the margin ante note 2.\n  Counsel maintain that this must be interpreted as if it read: 'An order of the District Court made in a probate case on appeal to it, shall be deemed a judgment. Such judgment is appealable. The manner or mode of taking and perfecting such appeal shall be the same manner or mode which is provided for the taking and perfecting of an appeal from other appealable judgments made and entered in the District Court.'\n  This proposal is in conflict with the purpose and limitations of the later Acts of 1911 and 1925. These are of general application, and any provision of the Alaska Code concerning appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals inconsistent with them is ineffective.\n  Moreover, we cannot accept the view that the words 'in the manner provided' found in section 943 were intended to permit appeals in probate matters without restriction-to relieve them of requirements generally applicable to causes in the courts of the Territory.\n  The court below reached the proper conclusion.\n  Affirmed.\n  Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result, but as they think the case made on the record is not one 'involving' provisions of the Alaska Code, it seems unnecessary to resolve the more doubtful question whether they are statutes of the United States. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 687\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judicial Code,  128, Act March 3, 1911, amended Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 28 \nU.S.C.A.  225:\n'(a) Review of final decisions.

United States   \n300 \nU.S. 297\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 298]\n\u00a0\n\nElisha Hanson and Eliot C. Lovett, both of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n  Mr. Golden W. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 299]\n\u00a0\n Bell, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Appellants are steamship corporations engaged in the transportation of freight through the Panama Canal between United States ports on the Gulf of Mexico and on the Pacific Coast. They constitute the Gulf Intercoastal Conference, which operates under an agreement, approved March 28, 1934, by the United States Shipping Board Bureau of the Department of Commerce, as provided by section 15 of the Shipping Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 733, 46 \nU.S.C.  814 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  814). On May 25, 1933, the Conference, in conformity to the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, section 2, 47 Stat. 1425, 46 \nU.S.C.  844 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  844), filed with the United States Shipping Board Bureau a new tariff, effective June 2, 1933, publishing certain rates for the transportation of freight, westbound from coast to coast.\n  The tariff, continuing the contract system in use by the Conference, provided for 'contract rates' for specified commodities, to be enjoyed by shippers who agree with the Conference, by written contract, to make all their shipments of those commodities by vessel of the Conference members for a specified period. The tariff rates on the same commodities for shippers not entering into contracts were $2 per ton higher than the contract rates. In 1934, the Secretary of Commerce ordered an investigation by the Shipping Board Bureau of the lawfulness of the contract rate system (see section 22 of the Shipping Act, 39 Stat. 736, 46 \nU.S.C.  821 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  821), and section 3 of the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, 47 Stat. 1426, 46 U.S.C.  845 (46 U.S.C.A.  845)). The ensuing report condemned the discrimination, and on July 3, 1935, the Secretary ordered the appellants to cease charging the higher rates to shippers who had not entered into contracts. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 300]\n\u00a0\n  In September of that year appellants filed new rate schedules, effective October 3, 1935, which continued the contract rate system. Thereupon the Secretary vacated his order of July 3d and made an order suspending the schedules and directing a second hearing concerning the lawfulness of the contract rate system. On this hearing new evidence was introduced, and relevant portions of the evidence adduced on the previous hearing were spread upon the record. In a report reviewing this record, the Secretary found that the 'real purpose of the suspended rates * * * is to prevent shippers from using the lines of other carriers and to discourage all others from attempting to engage in intercoastal transportation from and to the Gulf.' He accordingly found the rates unduly prejudicial and ordered their cancellation.\n  The present suit was brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia, three judges sitting, to set aside the order of the Secretary as without his statutory authority and because not supported by substantial evidence. From the decree of the district court sustaining the Secretary's order, 18 F.Supp. 25, the case comes here on appeal under section 31 of the Shipping Act, 39 Stat. 738, 46 U.S.C.  830 (46 U.S.C.A .  830), and the Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.  47 ( 28 U.S.C.A.  47). Appellants here, as in the court below, have assigned as error that the Secretary was without authority to make the order under review because the Executive Order of June 10, 1933, No. 6166,  12, which abolished the United States Shipping Board and transferred its functions to the Department of Commerce, was without constitutional and legislative authority, and because the findings and order of the Secretary were without support in the evidence.\n  First. Since the appeal was taken, the contention that the transfer to the Secretary, by Executive Order (No. 6166,  12), of powers conferred by the Shipping Act on the United States Shipping Board, was unauthorized by the terms of Title 4 of the Legislative Appropriation Act \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 301]\n\u00a0\n of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 413, as amended, 47 Stat. 1517, has been put at rest by the decision of this Court in Isbrandtsen-Moller Co., Inc., v. United States et al., \n300 \nU.S. 139\n, February 1, 1937. There we held that the failure of Congress, if any, to express its will in the earlier act had been remedied by various later acts mentioning the Executive Order, and making appropriations to the Department of Commerce for payment of the expenses of carrying out the provisions of the Shipping Act,1 and by section 204(a) of the Merchant Marine Act of June 29, 1936, 49 Stat. 1985 (46 U.S.C.A.  1114), which referred to functions of the former Shipping Board as 'now vested in the Department of Commerce pursuant to section 12 of the President's Executive Order No. 6166,' and transferred them to the newly-constituted United States Maritime Commission.\n  To dispose of further contentions also urged here, that Congress was without constitutional power to delegate to the President authority to determine whether the transfer should be effected, and that he did not exercise it in a constitutional manner, the Court found it enough that the order of the Secretary, which the Maritime Commission had continued in effect, had 'determined no rights and prescribed no duties' of the carrier. The rate order here is of a different sort and we face the question previously reserved. It is unnecessary now to pass on the efficacy of the transfer by Executive Order, for we are of opinion that as Congress itself had power to abolish the Shipping Board and to require its functions to be performed by the Secretary, it had power to recognize and validate his performance of those functions even though their attempted transfer by Executive Order was ineffectual.\n  It is well settled that Congress may, by enactment not otherwise inappropriate, 'ratify * * * acts which it \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 302]\n\u00a0\n might have authorized,' see Mattingly v. District of Columbia, \n97 \nU.S. 687, 690\n, and give the force of law to official action unauthorized when taken. Wilson v. Shaw, \n204 \nU.S. 24, 32\n; United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370, 382\n, 11 Ann.Cas. 688; Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 96; Chuoco Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549, 556\n; Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., \n257 \nU.S. 226, 232\n; Charlotte Harbor R. Co. v. Welles, \n260 \nU.S. 8, 11\n, 4; Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 \nU.S. 600, 603\n, 436. And we think that Congress, irrespective of any doctrine of ratification, has, by the enactment of the statutes mentioned, in effect confirmed and approved the exercise by the Secretary of powers originally conferred on the Shipping Board.\n  The mere fact that the validation is retroactive in its operation is not enough, in the circumstances of this case, to render it ineffective. In Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 429\n, 194, this Court recognized that a distinction must be taken 'between a bare attempt of the Legislature retroactively to create liabilities for transactions * * * fully consummated in the past * * * and the case of a curative statute aptly designed to remedy mistakes and defects in the administration of government where the remedy can be applied without injustice.' And see Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 164\n, 469. Here the retroactive application of the curative act impairs no substantial right or equity of appellants; their rights to an administrative hearing and determination, and to a judicial review, have been as fully preserved as if the act had been adopted at the date of the Executive Order. The proceedings were conducted by the Secretary in the name of the United States, cf. United States v. Heinszen & Co., supra, \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, at page 385, 11 Ann.Cas. 688, by virtue of the 1932 Act and the Executive Order. The consequences of the validating statute are free of the elements of novelty and surprise which have led to condemnation, as unreasonable and arbitrary, of other retroactive legislation. See \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 303]\n\u00a0\n Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 326; United States v. Hudson, \n299 \nU.S. 498\n, decided January 11, 1937. We conclude that the Secretary's exercise of the powers conferred on the Shipping Board has been sanctioned by Congress.\n  Second. Section 16 of the Shipping Act (46 U.S.C.A.  815) declares that 'it shall be unlawful for any common carrier by water,' subject to the Act, 'to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, locality, or description of traffic in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, locality, or description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.'2 The differential between appellants' rates on commodities transported under contract and the rates on the same commodities for non-contract shippers was prima facie discriminatory since the two rates were charged for identical services and facilities, and the narrow issue presented to the Secretary for decision was whether, in the conditions affecting the traffic involved, the discrimination was undue or unreasonable.\n  As pointed out by this Court in United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., Ltd., \n284 \nU.S. 474\n, the provisions of the Shipping Act which confer upon the Shipping Board authority over rates and practices of carriers by water, and prescribe the mode of its exercise, closely parallel those of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.) establishing the corresponding relations of the Interstate Commerce Commission to carriers by rail. Both have set up an administrative agency to whose informed judg- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 304]\n\u00a0\n ment and discretion Congress has committed the determination of questions of fact, on the basis of which it is authorized to make administrative orders.\n  Such determinations will not be set aside by courts if there is evidence to support them. Even though, upon a consideration of all the evidence, a court might reach a different conclusion, it is not authorized to substitute its own for the administrative judgment. See Manufacturers' R. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351\n; cf. United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., Ltd., supra, \n284 \nU.S. 474, 484\n, 250. Whether a discrimination in rates or services of a carrier is undue or unreasonable has always been regarded as peculiarly a question committed to the judgment of the administrative body, based upon an appreciation of all the facts and circumstances affecting the traffic. Manufacturers' R. Co. v. United States, supra; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, supra, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 361\n; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 25; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 196\n; Nashville Ry. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 584.\n  In determining whether the present discrimination was undue or unreasonable the Secretary was called upon to ascertain whether its effect was to exclude other carriers from the traffic, and if so, whether, as appellants urge, it operated to secure stability of rates with consequent stability of service, and, so far as either effect was found to ensue, to weigh the disadvantages of the former against the advantages of the latter. This was clearly recognized in the report upon which the present order is based. It states that the danger of cut-throat competition was lessened by section 3 of the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933 (46 U.S.C.A.  845), and that the contract system tends to create a monopoly. In view of the assurance of reasonable rate stability afforded by the Act of 1933, the Secretary concluded that this was the real purpose of the contract rate. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 305]\n\u00a0\n  Before the enactment of the Shipping Act in 1916, there was no Congressional regulation of rates and practices of water carriers. By section 18 of the Act (46 U.S.C.A.  817), the carriers were required to file only their maximum rates, which left them free to indulge in rate wars. Under sections 2 and 3 of the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933 (46 U.S.C.A.  844, 845), they are required to file schedules specifying their rates, which are subject to change only on thirty days' notice, and to examination by the Board as to their lawfulness, with power in it to suspend the rate pending investigation. We cannot say that cut-rates for 'tramp' and 'distressed' tonnage, which, according to appellants' witnesses, are the principal menace to rate stability, would not be substantially deterred by these requirements. The chairman of the Conference admitted that the 1933 statute 'has to a certain extent eliminated the condition necessitating the contract rate system.' In addition may be mentioned the testimony of shippers who favored the contract rate system, but admitted that they had had no difficulty with the stability of the service in their shipments from Atlantic ports, where the conferences have not adopted a contract system. We think there was evidence from which the Secretary could reasonably conclude that there was little need for a contract rate system to assure stability of service.\n  On the other hand, there was substantial evidence from which the Secretary could infer that the contract rate system would tend to give to the Conference carriers a monopoly by excluding competition from new lines. The secretary of the Conference testified that approximately 64 per cent. of the westbound port to port tonnage moved under the contract rate. Representatives of lines not members of the Conference stated that the tonnage left was not enough to make the operation of a new line profitable, and that the contract system precluded the employment of their idle steamers in the Gulf trade. The \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 306]\n\u00a0\n Conference chairman admitted that it would 'not be easy' for a new line to enter the Gulf service because it 'is now adequately tonnaged,' and that the contract system restricted the amount of available tonnage. He suggested that a competing line might be able to get tonnage if it offered as much as a 10 per cent. rate reduction, but admitted that it probably could not operate successfully at such a rate.\n  It also appeared, contrary to the assertion of appellants, that competing lines were not free to enter the Conference. By the provisions of the Conference agreement, it is prerequisite to admission that the applicant shall be engaged in the general cargo trade from the Gulf to the Pacific. There was testimony that the Conference had denied admission to a line because it did not have an established service in the Gulf, although at the time when it applied for membership it had idle vessels and 'offices and facilities' for conducting the business. It is an admissible inference from the evidence that a new line, to secure admission to the Conference, must either be able successfully to compete with the Conference lines at the start, notwithstanding the restriction of the contract rate, or must subject itself to a loss before it can qualify for admission.\n  There was thus evidence before the Secretary which tended to show that the contract rate system, by reason of the conditions prevailing in the traffic, had established a practical monopoly of cargoes moving from the Gulf ports to ports on the Pacific coast, from which competing carriers were excluded by the provisions of the Conference agreement, except on terms which were practically prohibitive, and that, since the adoption of the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, stability of service, which appellants urge as justification for the system, could be secured without a contract rate. As the Secretary has in- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 297\n, 307]\n\u00a0\n terpreted the evidence, the operation of the contract system, in the circumstances of this case, does not differ substantially from that of 'deferred rebates' outlawed in both foreign and coastwise shipping by section 14 of the Shipping Act, 39 Stat. 733, 46 U.S.C.  812 (46 U.S.C.A .  812).3\n  Even though, as appellants seem to argue, the evidence may lend itself to support a different inference, we are without authority to substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary that the discrimination was unreasonable.\n  Affirmed.\n  Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissents.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act April 7, 1934, 48 Stat. 529, 566; Act March 22, 1935, 49 Stat. 67, 99; Act May 15, 1936, 49 Stat. 1309, 1345. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Shipping Act,  15, 39 Stat. 733, 46 U.S.C.  814, 46 U.S. C.A.  814 (the Shipping Board may cancel or modify any agreement between a carrier and another carrier or person subject to the act, which it finds to be unjustly discriminatory); section 17, 39 Stat. 734, 46 U.S.C.  816, 46 U.S.C.A.  816 (the Board may order discontinuance of discriminatory rates charged by carriers in foreign commerce); section 18, 39 Stat. 735, 46 U.S.C.  817, 46 U.S.C.A.  817 (whenever the Board finds that any classification is unjust or unreasonable, it may order a just and reasonable one enforced). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 14 of the Shipping Act defines the term 'deferred rebate' as 'a return of any portion of the freight money by a carrier to any shipper as a consideration for the giving of all or any portion of his shipments to the same or any other carrier, or for any other purpose, the payment of which is deferred beyond the completion of the service for which it is paid, and is made only if, during both the period for which computed and the period of deferment, the shipper has complied with the terms of the rebate agreement or arrangement.'\n  The report of the House Committee on Merchant Marine & Fisheries, H.R. Doc. 805, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. (1914), recommended (p. 307) the prohibition of deferred rebates, adopted in section 14 of the Shipping Act, because it operated to tie shippers to a group of lines for successive periods, and because the system 'is unnecessary to secure excellence and regularity of service, a considerable number of conferences being operated today without this feature.' See, e.g., pp. 103105, 200. The Committee recognized that the exclusive contract system does not necessarily tie up the shipper as completely as 'deferred rebates', since it does not place him in 'continual dependence' on the carrier by forcing his exclusive patronage for one contract period under threats of forfeit of differentials accumulated during a previous contract period. Accordingly the Committee did not condemn the contract system completely. Cf. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Stoomvaart et al., 1 U.S.S.B. 285. The policy of the statute may properly be applied where, as in the circumstances of this case, the contract system must be taken as actually operating to effect a monopoly. Cf. Eden Mining Co. v. Bluefields Fruit & S.S. Co., 1 U.S.S.B. 41. \n\n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTABER V. INDIAN TERRITORY ILLUMINATING OIL CO.(1937)\nNo. 280\nArgued: January 6, 1937Decided: February 1, 1937\n\n\n  Messrs. Leon J. York and Guy L. Horton, both of Stillwater, Okl., for petitioner.\n  Messrs. Donald Prentice and Wm. P. McGinnis, both of Bartlesville, Okl., for respondent.\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 1\n, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The respondent, Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, holds an oil and gas lease covering lands of restricted Pawnee Indians. The question relates to the constitutional authority of the state of Oklahoma to tax certain property used by the respondent in its operations as lessee. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the property was not taxable because the lessee was a federal instrumentality and Congress had not consented to its taxation. 177 Okl. 67, 57 P.(2d) 1167. We granted certiorari (\n299 \nU.S. 528\n) October 12, 1936.\n  The property is described as 'one dwelling, portable, one garage, one tool house, engines, pump, water well equipment, tanks, derricks, casing, tubing, rods, pipe-lines, and one trailer truck, of the aggregate value of $ 15,869.23.' The tax is an ad valorem tax for the year 1933-34. There is no allegation or finding that the tax was discriminatory, the sole contention being that the property was not subject to ad valorem taxation because of its use as an adjunct to the production of oil and gas from the leasehold.\n  Our decisions distinguish between a nondiscriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government and one which imposes a direct burden upon the exertion of governmental powers. In the former case where there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of governmental functions, we have held that a nondis \n\n[300 \nU.S. 1\n, 4]\n\u00a0\n criminatory ad valorem tax is valid, although the property is used in the operations of the governmental agency. This distinction, recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, was stated and applied after full consideration in Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 9 Wall. 579, 591, and Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 31-36. Recent illustrations are found in Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 274, 75 A.L.R. 9, where the tax which was sustained was laid upon property used in operating an automotive stage line between points in California under a mail carrier's contract; and in Tirrell v. Johnston, \n293 \nU.S. 533\n, where a tax known as the 'gasoline road toll' was held to be payable by a rural mail carrier who delivered the mail by means of his own motor vehicle. See, also, Thomas v. Gay, \n169 \nU.S. 264, 273\n; Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375, 382\n; Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531, 536\n, 537, 583; Willcuts v.

Tax Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 147, 153\n, 341.\n  In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, \n288 \nU.S. 325\n, an ad valorem tax upon crude oil, held by the company in its storage tanks, was sustained against the claim that the oil was exempt because in its production the taxpayer was operating as an instrumentality of the United States. There the taxpayer relied, as does the state court here, upon the ruling in Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609, 593\n, where an ad valorem tax upon ores mined under a lease of restricted Indian land and in the bins on that land was held to be invalid. But we pointed out that in the Jaybird Case the tax 'was assessed on the ores in mass, and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated.' Indian Territory \n\n[300 \nU.S. 1\n, 5]\n\u00a0\n Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, supra, \n288 \nU.S. 325\n, at page 327. In those circumstances the tax was regarded as an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government. Emphasizing that distinction, we said in referance to the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company: 'Such immunity as petitioner enjoyed as a governmental instrumentality inhered in its operations as such, and being for the protection of the Government in its function extended no further than was necessary for that purpose.' Id., \n288 \nU.S. 325\n, at page 328, 53 S. Ct. 388, 389.\n  In that view the immunity cannot be said to extend to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax upon the property of the petitioner which is involved in the instant case. The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  It is so ordered. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Opinion of Supreme Court conformed to in (Okl.Sup.) 69 P.(2d) 359.[  Taber v.

In respect of the amount now in controversy, that court gave judgment for defendant (15 F.Supp. 356); the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (86 F.(2d) 954) and, its decision being in apparent conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Comar Oil Co. v. Burnet, 64 F.(2d) 965, this court granted the collector's petition for a writ of certiorari. \n300 \nU.S. 653\n, 57 S.Ct. 754, 81 L.Ed. --. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 657]\n\u00a0\n Hammonds and Branson owned oil and gas leases on undeveloped lands in Texas which provided for a royalty of one-eighth. They assigned to the Faith Oil Company which was principally owned by Green and Perkins. In taking the assignment, the company acted for itself to the extent of one- fourth and for Green and Perkins to the extent of three-eighths each. Later it transferred its interest to Perkins. So far as concerns the question here presented, Perkins may be treated as sole assignee of Hammonds and Branson. The assignment recites that they are owners of all rights under or incident to the leases and declares that 'in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($10.00) cash1 ... and of the further sum of Three Hundred Ninety Five Thousand Dollars ($395,000.00) to be paid out of the oil produced and saved from the ... lands, and to be one-fourth of all the oil produced and saved ... until the full sum ... is paid, we ... do hereby bargain, sell, transfer, assign, and convey all our rights, title, and interest in and to said leases and rights thereunder.'\n After description of the lands and leaseholds the assignment provides that the oil payment shall be made to the assignors, Hammonds and Branson, each to receive one-half thereof, 'out of the oil produced and saved from' the leased premises, 'which payments shall be made by the pipe line company or other purchaser of said oil, and shall be one-fourth (1\/4) of all the oil produced and saved from the above described land, until the full sum ... is fully paid.' It is understood and agreed that the $395, 000 'is payable out of oil only, if, as and when produced from said lands above described, and said oil payment does not constitute and shall not be a personal obligation of the assignee, its successors or assigns. ... The oil payment \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 658]\n\u00a0\n ... shall bear none of the expenses of the development of said leases or any other burden.' The instrument does not purport to reserve a lien.\n Perkins drilled wells on the leased lands and in 1933 produced oil; the assignors received substantial amounts, to apply on the payment to be made them; the oil was run from the wells into tanks on the leased premises from which it was taken by pipeline companies purchasing the oil. Each purchaser required and was furnished a division order executed by all the interested parties. By such orders assignors authorized purchasers to receive from the wells one-fourth of the oil and declared that the oil run should become the property of the purchasers as soon as received by them. In accordance with the orders, purchasers made payments directly and proportionately to the owner of the royalty reserved in the lease, to assignors, and to assignee. The last could not collect for any portion of the oil applicable to the oil payment to be made assignors.\n In their tax return for 1933 respondents, Perkins and wife, did not include in income any part of the proceeds that went to assignors. But the Commissioner charged the amounts received by the assignors to the respondents and allowed the latter depletion in respect of the same. At the trial it was proved that the long-established practice of the bureau was not to require the operator of an oil and gas lease to include as a part of his income the royalties payable in kind to the lessors. But where they were payable in cash the operator included the proceeds of all the oil and took as an offsetting deduction the amount of royalties paid. It was admitted that, if the assignors' payments are excluded, the depletion allowed respondents should be correspondingly reduced.\n The question is whether respondents' gross income should include moneys paid to assignors by purchasers of the oil. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 659]\n\u00a0\n We need not decide whether technical title to the oil while in the ground was in assignors, or in assignee. The federal income tax act is to be given a uniform construction of nation-wide application except in so far as Congress has made it dependent on state law. \n2\n The granting clause in the assignment would be sufficient, if standing alone, to transfer all the oil to the assignee. It does not specifically except or exclude any part of the oil. But it is qualified by other parts of the instrument. The provisions for payment to assignors in oil only, the absence of any obligation of the assignee to pay in oil or in money, and the failure of assignors to take any security by way of lien or otherwise unmistakably show that they intended to withhold from the operation of the grant one- fourth of the oil to be produced and saved up to an amount sufficient when sold to yield $395,000.3\n The construction that the parties put upon the assignment makes for the same conclusion. There is no suggestion that, having taken title, the assignee transferred any of the oil back to assignors. The division orders designated, and so served to indicate ownership of, the quantities belonging to each of the interested parties. And, in the circumstances, the orders given and proceeds received by assignors necessarily covered and were derived from oil not transferred by the assignment.\n Our decision in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, supports the view that the assignment did not transfer the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 660]\n\u00a0\n oil in question. We there construed section 214(a)(10), Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 241, which directed a reasonable allowance for depletion in the case of oil and gas wells 'according to the peculiar conditions in each case' and 'that such depletion allowance based on discovery value shall not exceed the net income, computed without allowance for depletion, from the property upon which the discovery is made. ... In the case of leases the deductions allowed ... shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.'\n The taxpayer, Palmer, was a member of a partnership that acquired oil and gas leases, discovered oil, executed a writing conferring on a company the right to take over a part of the leased property in consideration of a present payment of a cash bonus, and future payments to be made 'out of one-half of the first oil produced and saved' to the extent of $1,000,000, and an additional 'excess royalty' of one-eighth of all the oil produced and saved. The writing declared that the partnership 'does sell, assign, set over, transfer and deliver ... unto the' oil company the described leased premises.\n In his tax return, Palmer reported his share of the income derived by the partnership from the bonus payment and oil received under its contract with the oil company and, relying on section 214(a)(10), made a deduction for depletion based on value of oil in place on the date of discovery. The Commissioner refused to allow the deduction on the theory that the transaction was a sale of the leases by the partnership, and that the only allowable deduction was one based upon the cost of the property. As cost was less than the discovery value, the Commissioner's allowance of depletion was less than that claimed by Palmer and the tax was correspondingly greater. He paid it, and sued the collector to recover the amount by which the Commissioner's ruling operated to increase his burden.\n The District Court upheld the Commissioner's ruling, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, this court reversed. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 661]\n\u00a0\n We said (\n287 \nU.S. 551\n, at pages 557, 558, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226): 'The language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital. ... Similarly, the lessor's right to a depletion allowance does not depend upon his retention of ownership or any other particular form of legal interest in the mineral content of the land. It is enough if by virtue of the leasing transaction he has retained a right to share in the oil produced. If so, he has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production. Thus we have recently held that the lessor is entitled to a depletion allowance on bonus and royalties, although by the local law ownership of the minerals, in place passed from the lessor upon the execution of the lease. ... Thus throughout their changing relationships with respect to the properties, the oil in the ground was a reservoir of capital investment of the several parties, all of whom ... were entitled to share in the oil produced.'\n Thus in that case we held assignors' mere stipulation for royalty out of oil operated to save to them an economic interest in the oil sufficient to entitle them to deduct from their income derived from the oil an allowance for depletion. If Palmer had retained no interest in the oil, he would have been entitled to no deduction on account of depletion. Ownership was essential. The assignee was not entitled to income from Palmer's share of the oil nor to deduct from the income it received from its own interest any part of the depletion allowance that was attributable to Palmer's interest.\n Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312\n, 55 S.Ct. 174, construed depletion provisions in the Revenue Act of 1926 which so far as concerns ownership are not to be distinguished from corresponding provisions considered in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 662]\n\u00a0\n Palmer v. Bender, supra. Section 204(c)(2), 44 Stat. 14, declared that in the case of oil and gas wells 'the allowance for depletion shall be 27 1\/2 per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year.' Section 234(a)(8), 44 Stat. 41, required the deductions allowed to be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee. The taxpayer, assignee of the lease, extracted substantial quantities of oil. By the terms of the lease and assignment he was obligated to pay royalties in cash or kind totaling one-fourth of the oil. He claimed that gross proceeds of all the oil should form the basis for computation of the allowance for depletion. The Commissioner ruled that the deduction should be limited to 27 1\/2 per cent. of the gross production less royalties. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld that ruling; the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the board; we sustained the Commissioner. Our opinion shows that the phrase, 'income from the property,' means income from oil and gas only; that, where the lessee turns over royalty oil in kind to the lessor, the amount retained by lessee is the basis for his computation of depletion and the royalty oil is the basis for that allowable to lessor. In that connection we suggested that Congress did not intend a different result where the lessee sells all the oil and pays over the royalty in the form of cash. And in approval of the Commissioner's ruling we said (\n293 \nU.S. 312\n, at page 321, 55 S.Ct. 174, 178): 'The apportionment gives respondent 27 1\/2 per cent. of the gross income from production which it had the right to retain and the assignor and lessor respectively 27 1\/2 per cent. of the royalties they receive. Such an apportionment has regard to the economic interest of each of the parties entitled to participate in the depletion allowance. Compare Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 53 S.Ct. 225.'\n As in the earlier of these cases the assignor was entitled to deduct depletion from income he received from his interest in the oil, so in the later one the assignee was not entitled to deduct from income received from its share an \n\n[301 \nU.S. 655, 663]\n\u00a0\n allowance for depletion attributable to the assignor's interest. The owner of an interest in the deposit is entitled to deduct for depletion of the part producing his income but may not deduct for depletion of a share belonging to another.\n As Hammonds and Branson, the assignors in this case, would be entitled to an allowance for depletion in respect of the oil sold out of their share,4 the income from that interest is not chargeable to respondents, Perkins and wife. It follows that the Commissioner erred in including in their income the payments made by purchasers to assignors for their share of the oil.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO think the oil and gas produced by the assignee of the lease, and their proceeds, were his income and not any the less so because he agreed to apply a part to payment of the purchase price of the lease, and gave an equitable lien to secure the payment. Whether the purchase price, when paid, represented a capital gain taxable to the assignors, and whether in that case their interest would be subject to a depletion allowance under our decision in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, are questions irrelevant to the present issue. The judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Contemporaneously with the assignment there was paid $105,000 in cash and $50,000 in notes. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Lynch v.

Holt, both of Austin, Tex., for appellants.\n  Mr. S. A. L. Morgan, of Amarillo, Tex., for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case challenges the validity of a gas proration order issued by the Railroad Commission of Texas for the Panhandle fields on December 10, 1935, and carried forward in supplemental orders. \n1\n The orders were en- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 58]\n\u00a0\n tered under chapter 120 of the Texas Acts 1935, Forty-Fourth Legislature, Regular Session, commonly known as House Bill 266 (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008). Under the orders the production of sweet gas from the plaintiffs' wells is limited to an amount below their market requirements under existing contracts, below their present production, and below the capacity of their transportation and marketing facilities. It is charged that the purpose of so limiting the production is not to prevent waste, or to prevent invasion of the legal rights of co-owners in the common reservoir, but solely to compel the plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, to purchase gas from those well owners who have not provided themselves with a market and marketing facilities-well owners who under existing law are obliged to stop production, for want of a market, unless some marketing outlet is found.\n  Two suits to enjoin enforcement of the order were brought in the federal court for Western Texas. One was by Texas Panhandle Gas Utilities Company, for which Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation has been substituted as plaintiff; the other by Texoma Natural Gas Company. In each suit the members of the Railroad Commission and the Attorney General of the State were made defendants. The properties for which the plaintiffs seek protection are their sweet gas wells and reserves in the Texas Panhandle; their pipe lines extending into other States; their compressors and marketing facilities for use in connection therewith; and contracts which they have made for the supply of the gas to distributors in other States. The plaintiffs claim that the order takes this property without warrant in law. They contend that the order is in excess of the authority which House Bill 266 confers upon the commission; and that, if the statute be construed as conferring the authority exercised, it violates the Federal Constitution and that of the State. The District Judge issued a restraining order. The cases \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 59]\n\u00a0\n were considered together. The court, three judges sitting, granted temporary injunctions, Texas Panhandle Gas Co. v. Thompson (D.C.) 12 F. Supp. 462,2 and made them permanent, Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation v. Thompson, 14 F.Supp. 318. The cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal. The jurisdiction, federal and equitable, was not questioned. The record is extensive; the findings of fact explicit; the briefs in this Court occupy over 500 pages.\n  The Texas Panhandle contains the largest natural gas field in the United States, an enormous reservoir of natural gas and oil extending through seven counties for a distance of 125 miles with a width of from 10 to 40 miles. The development of the gas industry which began there in 1926 has proceeded at a rapid rate since 1933. The field produces both sweet and sour gas. \n3\n Wasteful use of sweet gas is prohibited by the statute; and, within the statutory definition, practically the only nonwasteful use is for heat and light. For such use there is substantially no local market,4 as the region is sparsely settled. Gas cannot be stored. To utilize the sweet gas of the Panhandle field, it must be delivered to the ultimate consumer by pipe lines in a continuous flow from the wells to the burner tips of the consumer. Prior to the entry of the orders challenged, the owners of approximatey 80 per cent. of the total area in the Panhandle fields \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 60]\n\u00a0\n proven productive of sweet gas had constructed six major pipe lines from the West Panhandle field,5 and three from the East Panhandle field, extending to Chicago, Des Moines, Omaha, Sioux City, Kansas City, St. Paul, Indianapolis, Denver, Minneapolis, Fort Worth, Dallas, and other distant points. Six or seven of these major pipe line companies, including the plaintiffs', have produced and transported to the markets only gas produced from their own leases.\n  Under the restrictions imposed by the present statute, there is substantially no market outlet for the sweet gas of these fields except such as may be provided by pipe lines. The owners of 180 wells in the West Panhandle field, and of 121 wells in the East Panhandle field, together representing about 20 per cent. of the proven reserves of sweet gas in the whole field, neither own nor control any pipe line. And they have no access to any;6 since none of the pipe lines here involved is a common carrier. The plaintiffs and most of the other owners of pipe lines have no economic occasion to purchase gas from wells of the non-pipe line producers, as the potential capacity of their own wells far exceeds their market demand. \n7\n There appears no legal obstacle, under the law of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 61]\n\u00a0\n Texas, to the construction of additional pipe lines to serve the owners of wells in the Panhandle fields now without such connections. It is said that there are communities in other States which would afford markets if pipe lines were constructed to reach them. But the financial difficulties are obvious.\n  Prior to House Bill 266, several efforts, statutory and administrative, had been made to compel, or induce, the owners of existing pipe lines to purchase the seeet gas of those well owners who lack pipe line facilities. Orders entered under statutes enacted prior to 1933 were enjoined as unconstitutional or ultra vires. \n8\n By chapter \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 62]\n\u00a0\n 100, Acts 1933, Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session,9 the use of natural gas was permitted for other purposes than light or fuel, including the manufacture of natural gasoline, where no reasonable market for light or fuel was available to the owner. Production under authority of this statute and the permits issued thereunder was found to involve intolerable waste. \n10\n Such was the situation when on May 1, 1935, the Legislature enacted House Bill 266 (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008), under which the order here challenged was issued.\n  The act undertakes by drastic provisions to end the waste of sweet gas. It provides:\n'Sec. 3. The production, transportation, or use of natural gas in such manner, in such amount, or under such conditions as to constitute waste is hereby declared to be unlawful and is prohibited. The term 'waste' among \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 63]\n\u00a0\n other things shall specifically include: (then follow specifications (a) to (m) inclusive).\n\n'(h) The production of natural gas in excess of transportation or market facilities, or reasonable market demand for the type of gas produced.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008,  3.\n\n  The defendants contend that the act likewise requires restriction of production regardless of the existence of waste, for the adjustment of rights of owners in a common reservoir of gas. And, as we read the substance of defendants' argument, they also construe the statute as authorizing gas proration orders, to provide a market for the sweet gas of those wells which, because they lack pipe line connections, have heretofore sold their gas for inferior, wasteful uses. These claims are rested primarily on the following provision:\n'Sec. 10. It shall be the duty of the Commission to prorate and regulate the daily gas well production from each common reservoir in the manner and method herein set forth. The Commission shall prorate and regulate such production for the protection of public and private interests: (a) In the prevention of waste as 'waste' is defined herein; (b) In the adjustment of correlative rights and opportunities of each owner of gas in a common reservoir to produce and use or sell such gas as permitted in this Article.' Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008,  10.\n\n  This provision is supplemented by others including those set forth in the margin (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008,  1, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20). 11 \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 64]\n\u00a0\n  On December 10, 1935, the Railroad Commission, after hearings held, issued the basic order here challenged, which provides, among other things:\n'It is ordered, That effective, 7 o'clock A.M., December 11, 1935, the daily allowable gas production, computed on the basis set forth in House Bill No. 266, is as follows:\n\n  East Panhandle Field  181,174,000 cubic feet daily   West Sweet Panhandle   Field  608,552,000 cubic feet daily   West Sour Panhandle   Field  451,137,000 cubic feet daily\n   'It is ordered, That the daily allowable production of gas for individual wells in the East and West Panhandle Fields shall be determined by dividing the reasonable market demand into two parts, and that these parts shall be distributed to each well in proportion to the relative \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 65]\n\u00a0\n producing ability of these individual wells and the number of acres containing each of these wells, but in no case shall more than one hundred sixty (160) acres in the East Panhandle Field and not more than Six Hundred Forty (640) acres in the West Panhandle Field, in both sweet and sour zones, be allocated to any one well for the purpose of proration.\n'It is ordered, That the total daily allowable production of gas from gas wells in the East and West Pan \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 66]\n\u00a0\n handle Fields shall be distributed and prorated among the individual wells on the following basis and in the following manner, to-wit: Fifty (50%) per cent. of the reasonable market demand of the field shall be allocated on the ratio of the individual well acreage to the sum of the total well acreage in the field; and fifty (50%) per cent. of the reasonable market demand of the field shall be allocated on the ratio of the individual well potential to the sum of the total well potentials in the field.'\n\n  The order reduces plaintiffs' allowable production to a volume far below their requirements. The plaintiffs and other pipe line owners acquired, at large cost, their markets in distant States and their transportation and marketing facilities. \n12\n By means of their pipe lines all the sweet gas produced by the plaintiffs (and likewise all produced by other pipe line owners) was, and is, marketed under contracts with distant distributors, chiefly in other States. These markets are not free markets. The plaintiffs necessarily bound themselves to supply the requirements of the distributors; and the distributors bound themselves to take their requirements from the plaintiffs. In order to fulfill their contractual obligations, the plaintiffs developed the capacity of their wells and acquired large reserves to provide for their future needs so that they have no occasion to purchase gas from other wells. By limiting the plaintiffs' allowable production, the order disables them from perform- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 67]\n\u00a0\n ing their contracts unless they purchase gas from non-pipe line wells. Such purchases would at least involve the cost of the gas and the loss resulting from failure to make fuller use of their own property.\n  The plaintiffs do not contest that the State has power to conserve its natural resources for the public, as well as to protect private rights, 13 or that the Legislature has power to confer upon the Railroad Commission authority to make and enforce regulations to that end; or that to limit production to the aggregate reasonable market demand is, as a conservation measure, clearly proper in the interest of the public and of the private persons owning the right to draw from a common reservoir; or that the commission has authority to issue regulations to that end. The plaintiffs do not deny that the Legislature may confer upon the Railroad Commission also authority to prorate the total allowable production among all the individual wells which draw from the common reservoir, provided the proration is in accordance with their respective market demands and due consideration is given to existing reserves. But they insist that House Bill 266 (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6008) has not conferred that authority. And as to the order, the plaintiffs assert that, while restrictive in form, it is in fact coercive; that its purpose and effect are not to prevent waste of gas in the common reservoir nor to prorate the opportunities of production as distinguished from marketing; that the limitation of the production of the wells is merely a device to compel the individual plaintiffs, and other pipe line owners, to purchase gas for which they have no need; that the real purpose and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 68]\n\u00a0\n effect of the order are to prorate, not production, but distant markets and the facilities for serving them; and that, thus, the order takes their property without warrant in law.\n  First. Prior to the enactment of House Bill 266,14 the property rights of the plaintiffs were substantially those conferred by the common law of the State. Under it, the owner of land has title to oil and gas in place and, likewise, to the oil and gas which migrate to formations under his land through drainge from other lands. \n15\n Under that rule, he may produce all the oil and gas that will flow out of the well on his land, subject to the exercise by other landowners of the same right of capture through drilling offsetting wells, so as to get their full share. \n16\n This common-law rule, declared in an unbroken line of authorities, has been widely applied. \n17\n While a producer who negligently uses explosives in his operations will be liable if he causes physical damage to his \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 69]\n\u00a0\n neighbors' gas and oil bearing strata and thus impairs the productivity thereof,18 the common law of the State did not, apparently, afford a remedy against depleting the common supply by wasteful taking or use of oil or gas drawn from the wells on one's own property. But since 1899 the Legislature of the State has prohibited, or curbed, certain practices in the production of gas and oil which it recognized as wasteful. \n 19\n\u00a0\n\n  Second. The defendants contend that the order assailed is a regulation duly promulgated for the prevention of waste, and the protection of correlative rights of owners in the common pool, and was so applied. It may be assumed that House Bill 266 should be construed as authorizing regulations to prevent waste, and to create and protect correlative rights of owners in a common reservoir of gas to their justly proportionate shares thereof, free of drainage to neighboring lands. It may be assumed, also, that the statute, so construed, is a valid exercise of the State's undoubted power to legislate to those ends; and that it validly delegates to the Railroad Commission authority to promulgate regulations therefor. It is settled that to all administrative regulations purporting to be made under authority legally delegated there attaches a presumption of the existence of facts justifying the specific exercise. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. White, \n296 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 163, 101 A.L.R. 853. But, obviously, the proration orders would not be valid if shown to bear no reasonable relation either to the prevention of waste or the protection of correlative rights, or if shown to be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 70]\n\u00a0\n otherwise arbitrary. The plaintiffs have assumed the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption and of establishing that the order is an arbitrary taking of their property. They assert, among other things, that they have, at all times, conducted their operations prudently and without waste; that they have, in fact, taken only a small part of the gas in the ground which they own or lease; and that there is no present danger that the pipe line owners will, by continuing to operate as they have done, cause waste or prejudice either to any public interest, or to a property right of any other person. We think the plaintiffs have sustained the burden resting upon them. For their assertions are adequately supported by the following special findings of the lower court:\n  1. 'The owners of wells connected to pipe lines, including complainants have always produced their wells in a prudent and skilful manner and in accordance with the most approved methods of production, without committing or causing physical waste.'\n  2. 'Before House Bill 266 went into effect, grossly wasteful practices in the production of natural gas in the Panhandle field were occurring,' but 'most of this waste was due to the extravagant production of natural gas from oil wells and to the production of gas from gas wells and processing such gas for the extraction of a very small quantity of natural gasoline therefrom and popping or wasting to the air the residue gas, which constituted 97% of the fuel value of the gas in its original state. * * * No evidence was offered-indeed, it was not even seriously claimed-that anything complainant had done or contemplated doing has, in the slightest degree, contributed or will contribute to that waste.'\n  3. Even if the effect of the Texas legislation be to halt production by other well owners, 'the production from their own wells by complainant and other pipe lines of the quantity of gas required from time to time to fulfill \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 71]\n\u00a0\n their marketing contracts and requirements will cause no coning or channeling of water, no trapping off of recoverable oil or gas, no underground waste of oil, gas or reservoir energy or reduction of the total quantity of recoverable gas from the field, even though the other wells in the sweet gas area of the West Panhandle field be produced at a much lower rate or be not produced.'\n  4. Large and wasteful production of gas in connection with production of oil in the Panhandle field, and, more recently, in connection with the operations of plants 'stripping' the gas of its natural gasoline content, 'has resulted in the migration of tremendous quantities of natural gas from the southwestern side of the field to the northeastern side of the field. Many of these areas of low pressure are situated in the sour gas producing area, with the result that tremendous quantities of sweet gas have moved out from the sweet gas area into the sour gas area,' and have thus become unfit for use as fuel for lighting and heating purposes. Drainage away from the areas of complainants' holdings is found to have been intensified by disproportionate production of gas from gas wells not connected to pipe lines. In the East Panhandle field 'the leases on which the wells connected to pipe lines are located have produced an average-(of) 8,116,000 cubic feet of gas per acre, and those on which the wells connected to stripping plants are located have produced an average of 16, 662,000 cubic feet per acre.' In the West Panhandle field, production at the time of trial of this case had aggregated 4,427,642,131,000 cubic feet. 'Of this total the pipe lines, with an ownership of 56% of the total reserves, have produced only 529,545,454,000 cubic feet, while the owners of the other 44% have produced 3,898,096,776,000 cubic feet. Complainant, with an ownership of approximately 20% of the total reserves, had produced only 98,808,409,000 cubic feet, or 2.25% of the total withdrawals from the West Panhandle field.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 72]\n\u00a0\n The average rock pressure of the wells not connected to pipe lines is materially lower than that of complainants' and other pipe line companies' wells. Hence, in the West Panhandle field, 'by reason of these fifferentials in pressure between the wells connected to pipe lines and those not connected, the migration or drainage as a whole is from the wells connected to pipe lines, including those connected to complainant's pipe lines, to the wells not connected to pipe lines.' Likewise, 'all along the northeast slope of the structure in the East Panhandle field there is an extremely low pressure area, where tremendous quantities of gas have been produced in connection with the operation of oil wells and wells connected to stripping plants. The general drainage in the East Panhandle field is from the areas of high pressure toward and to these low pressure areas. The majority of the wells not connected to pipe lines are situated in these low pressure areas, or between these low pressure areas and the high pressure areas to the south and west thereof, in which areas of higher pressure the wells connected to the pipe lines are situated . * * * Very large quantities of gas have migrated from the reserves of the pipe lines, including the reserves of complainants, to the low pressure areas in and around the oil fields on the northeast slope of the reservoir and to the areas on which most of the 391 wells belonging to others than the pipe lines in the West Panhandle field are situated.' Further, past losses do not complete the story. 'Without regard to the rate of withdrawal in the existing areas of low pressure, the migration of gas from the reserves of the pipe lines to those areas of low pressure will continue over a long period of time.'\n  In the light of these findings the lower court concluded that the order was not intended to prevent waste attributable to plaintiffs; and that it was not intended to adjust correlative rights in the common reservoir for the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 73]\n\u00a0\n purpose of averting unjust drainage from the reserves of those wells lacking pipe line connections. On the other hand, the court concluded that the proration ordered, with its drastic limitation of output from wells now connected to pipe lines, will obviously not protect those wells against undue drainage to other parts of the field, but will deprive their owners of the protection which fuller production would offer. These findings are adequately supported by the evidence.\n  On the other hand, the assertion of the defendants that the order will, by requiring a uniform and rateable system of production by all the wells, result in the ultimate recovery of a larger amount of gas than would otherwise be produced, and, likewise, the assertion that the plaintiffs, by their present production, are depriving, or threaten to deprive, non-pipe line owners of their opportunity to share rateably in the gas in the common reservoir, are not sustained. By the assignment of errors in this Court, defendants challenged the correctness of many of the findings. But we are of opinion that, so far as here material, all their contentions, and also the findings of the Railroad Commission in its order of December 10, prophesying 'waste' if the proration ordered is not carried out, are unfounded.\n  Third. The defendants contend, apparently, that House Bill 266 should be construed as authorizing the Commission to reduce the production of the plaintiffs and of other pipe line owners, even if the sole purpose of doing so is to furnish a market for the sweet gas of those wells now without pipe line connections. On the other hand, the plaintiffs insist that House Bill 266 should be construed as authorizing the proration of production only in connection with, and as part of, waste prevention; and that, since their operations do not involve or threaten waste, the order was without statutory authority. That contention the lower court sustained. It did so, on the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 74]\n\u00a0\n ground that to authorize the restriction of nonwasteful production by the pipe line well owners solely for the purpose of compelling them to furnish other wells with a market would be a change of the common law of Texas so radical that, if the Legislature had so intended, it would have expressed that intention in language more explicit than any used in the act. Moreover, the court pointed out that, under the established rule of construction, the interpretation urged by defendants should be avoided because the statute so construed would be of doubtful validity. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n  We are always reluctant to pass upon a seriously controverted question of the meaning of a state statute, because our decision, although disposing of the particular case, cannot settle the issue of the proper construction of the statute. \n21\n No court of the State has construed the act. The defendants might, perhaps, have secured its construction by the state court. For the amendment of section 266 of the Judicial Code made in 1913 provides that upon the institution of an appropriate suit in a state court a stay may be had of the proceedings in the federal court to await adjudication by the state court. 22 But no suit in a state court was instituted by the defendants to that end. When not instructed by some decision of a state court, we are disposed, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, to accept the construction given by the lower federal court to a statute of the State, particularly when that court is composed, as in this in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 75]\n\u00a0\n stance, wholly of citizens of the State, familiar with the history of the statute, the local conditions to which it applies, and the character of the State's laws. \n23\n But, being under duty to make an independent study of the question, we have done so.24 That study leaves us in grave doubt whether the lower court has correctly interpreted the intention of the lawmakers. \n25\n On the other hand, we are clearly of opinion that, if the act were construed as the defendants contend it should be, and as the commission has applied it, it would violate the Federal Constitution. As a general rule, it is no less true with reference to State than to Federal legislation that this Court will not decide an issue of constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably be decided upon a \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 76]\n\u00a0\n construction of the statute under which the act is clearly constitutional. Compare Bratton v. Chandler, \n260 \nU.S. 110, 114\n, 44; South Utah Mines & Smelters v. Beaver County, \n262 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 43 S. Ct. 577, 579; Hopkins v. Southern California Telephone Co., \n275 \nU.S. 393, 403\n, 183. But where one party's case depends upon a construction of a state statute under which it plainly must be held to violate the Federal Constitution, and where the proper construction of the statute is a matter of grave doubt, this Court will rest its decision on the Constitution, and will not undertake to decide the question of construction as to which it lacks the power to give a definitive answer. Compare Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196, 204\n, 556; Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 578\n, 193, 36 A.L.R. 1105; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 396\n, 53 S. Ct. 190, 194. We, therefore, accept, for the purposes of our decision, the defendants' construction; and pass to the discussion of constitutional questions.\n  Fourth. Either production greater than the demand or use for an inferior purpose would necessarily involve overground waste of gas. The manner, place, or extent of production might lead to underground waste. We assume that the prohibition of any wasteful conduct, whether primarily in behalf of other owners of gas in the common reservoir, or because of the public interests involved, is consistent with the Constitution of Texas and that of the United States, and that to prevent waste production may be prorated. \n26\n We assume, also, that the State may constitutionally prorate production in order to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 77]\n\u00a0\n prevent undue drainage of gas from the reserves of well owners lacking pipe line connections. \n27\n If proration were lawfully applied for any such purposes, the fact that thereby other private persons would incidentally and gratuitously obtain important benefits would present no constitutional obstacle. And the fact that plaintiffs' gas is to be sold in interstate commerce would not preclude such exercise of the State's power. Compare Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 235\n, 52 S. Ct. 559, 565, 86 A.L.R. 403.\n  But the sole purpose of the limitation which the order imposes upon the plaintiffs' production is to compel those who may legally produce, because they have market outlets for permitted uses, to purchase gas from potential producers whom the statute prohibits from producing because they lack such a market for their possible product. Plaintiff's operations are neither causing nor threatening any overground or underground waste. Every well owner in the field is free to produce the gas, provided he does not do so wastefully. He is legally and, so far as appears, physically free to provide himself with a market and with transportation and marketing facilities. There is no basis for a claim that his right, or opportunity, will be interfered with by a disproportionate taking by any one of those who may legally produce.\n  The lower court found specifically:\n'The terms and provisions of the orders attacked, the necessary operation and effect of such orders, the history of the field and other pertinent facts as disclosed by this record conclusively establish that the purpose of the Commission underlying the orders was, upon a theory of protecting correlative rights to coerce complainant and other (others) similarly situated to buy gas from, and thus to share their private marketing contracts and commitments and the use of their pipe lines and other facil- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 78]\n\u00a0\n ities for transmitting their gas to market with, the owners of wells not now connected to pipe lines, who have not contributed in money, services, negotiations, skill, forethought or otherwise to the development of such markets and the construction of such pipe lines and other facilities. In short to compel complainants to afford markets to those having none.\n\n'The necessary operation and effect of such orders is to take from complainant and others similarly situated substantial and valuable interests in their private marketing contracts and commitments and in the use of their pipe lines and other facilities for transmitting their gas to their markets, without compensation, and to confer same upon the owners of the approximately 180 sweet gas wells in the field not connected to pipe lines.'\n\n  The use of the pipe line owner's wells and reserves is curtailed solely for the benefit of other private well owners. The pipe line owner, a private person, is, in effect, ordered to pay money to another private well owner for the purchase of oil which there is no wish to buy. \n28\n Moreover, he is thus prevented from protecting himself, to the extent that he is able to market his gas, against the losses which the court below finds are occurring and will continue to occur due to drainage from the high-pressure areas, wherein plaintiffs' wells are located, to the existing low-pressure areas, in which are located the majority of the wells not connected to pipe lines. There is here no taking for the public benefit; nor is payment of compensation provided. Plaintiffs' pipe lines are private property. So far as appears, they are constructed on private lands. There is no suggestion that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 79]\n\u00a0\n any of them is a common carrier of gas. The purpose of the owners in constructing the pipe lines was for the transport of gas only from their own leases, and such has been their consistent policy. Unlike the property involved in The Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, the pipe lines are not used in connection with the operation of any public utility in Texas. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n  The purpose of this order is the same as that which the Legislature sought to achieve by the 'Common Purchaser Act,' of August 12, 1931, held unconstitutional in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C.) 59 F. (2d) 750. The effect upon the property of the pipe line owners of the two statutes and the orders issued thereunder is, likewise, the same. There is a difference in the means employed; but the difference is not of legal significance. The 1931 act attempted to compel the purchase by frankly commanding it, under sanctions criminal and civil. The 1935 act operates by indirection. Its command is no less compelling; its penalties not significantly different. The order disables the plaintiffs from performing their contracts except by means of purchases. Resort to those means necessarily results in depriving the plaintiffs of property. Under each statute, if obeyed, the State takes from the pipe line owner the money with which the purchase is made, the money lost through curtailed use of properties developed at large expense, the money lost because of the drainage away from his land of the gas which he is forbidden to produce for himself, but must buy from those towards whose lands it migrates.\n  Our law reports present no more glaring instance of the taking of one man's property and giving it to another. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 80]\n\u00a0\n In Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. State of Nebraska, \n164 \nU.S. 403\n; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n217 \nU.S. 196, 18\n Ann.Cas. 989;30 Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 \nU.S. 340\n; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Cahill, \n253 \nU.S. 71, 10\n A.L.R. 1335; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co. v. Morristown, \n276 \nU.S. 182, 48\n S. Ct. 276; and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co. v. Holmberg, \n282 \nU.S. 162\n, expenditures directed to be made for the benefit of a private person were held invalid, although the party ordered to pay was a common carrier. In Citizens' Savings & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, and Cole v. La Grange, \n113 \nU.S. 1\n, the payments ordered for the benefit of a private person were declared invalid, although the money was to be raised by general taxation. In Myles Salt Co., Ltd. v. Board of Commissioners, \n239 \nU.S. 478\n, the exaction was held unlawful, though imposed under the guise of an assessment for alleged betterments. Compare Georgia Railway & Electric Co. v. Decatur, \n295 \nU.S. 165\n. And this Court has many times warned that one person's property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose, even though compensation be paid. See Hairston v. Danville and Western Ry. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 598, 605\n, 606, 13 Ann.Cas. 1008; Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles, \n262 \nU.S. 700, 705\n. Compare Cincinnati v. Vester, \n281 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 449.\n  Fifth. The defendants contend that the situation in the Panhandle field presented a conflict of private interests so serious as to become a matter of public concern; and that the Legislature has power to adopt measures to prevent the harmful discord. They insist, moreover, that the plaintiffs, having invoked the legislative action to stop the wasteful and disproportionate drawing of sweet gas by others-a prohibition of which they are now reaping the benefits-may not deny the legislative power to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 55\n, 81]\n\u00a0\n authorize the incidental limitations of its own production; since the Legislature would not have prohibited the waste, or inferior uses of the gas, without providing for its purchase by the pipe line companies. Whether the latter assertion is true in fact, we do not know. But it is clear that there is no basis in law for the argument, since there is no claim that plaintiffs ever consented to inserting any such provision in the act. Indeed, they insist, as a matter of construction, that the Legislature has not done so. And House Bill 266 is so much more drastic a statute than the restrictions upon inferior uses of gas which were apparently the object of plaintiffs' efforts before the Legislature that in their present situation plaintiffs cannot fairly be said to be receiving the benefits and evading the burdens of a measure which they initiated. Moreover, plaintiffs do not assert rights under the statute which they assail. They have not taken, and are not obliged to take, any affirmative steps thereunder to obtain whatever benefits may accrue to them because of the restrictions imposed on production for inferior uses. Compare Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 \nU.S. 415, 421\n; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407, 411\n; Booth Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 208, 211\n. Those benefits result incidentally from the enactment of other provisions of the act, the constitutionality of which is not questioned, and which seem clearly separable from the sections here challenged. Compare Hurley v. Commission of Fisheries, \n257 \nU.S. 223, 42\n S. Ct. 83; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 308\n.31\n  Affirmed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The complaints' original bills challenged earlier orders issued by the Railroad Commission under the Act here in question, notably the orders of August 28, and September 25, 1935. These orders were the subjects of temporary injunctions granted in Texas Panhandle Gas Co. v. Thompson (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 462 Upon the issuance of the order of December 10, 1935, complainants amended their bills to make that order and its supplements the object of their attack. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare note 1, supra.  \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Only sweet gas is fit for lighting and heating. Sour gas is that contaminated by sulphur compounds. It is now used in this field principally in the manufacture of carbon black. When the act was passed, plants supplying 70% of the carbon black manufactured in the United States were operating in this field.  \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The small market for sweet gas within the field is limited to fuel for the drilling of wells and the operation of industries incident to the oil and gas business; to small pipe lines supplying gas to communities near the field; and to purchases by two companies with pipe lines to distant cities. These have made 30 new connections with wells of others and are taking rateably from these wells. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] For administrative purposes the territory is divided into the East Panhandle and the West Panhandle zones. The West zone alone contains any sour gas area. The sweet gas area of the West Panhandle field embraces 723, 000 acres. In it there are 517 wells, 180 of which do not have an outlet for light and fuel purposes. The sweet gas area of the East Panhandle field embraces 181,000 acres. In it there are 322 wells, of which 121 do not have an outlet for light and fuel purposes. Gas from the Panhandle field is supplied for domestic and industrial light and fuel purposes to approximately 10,000,000 persons in the United States.  \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The only exception to this is in the case of the few independent wells with which two of the pipe line companies have made connections. See note 4, supra.  \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Thus at the time of the hearing below Texoma Natural Gas Company was producing its wells at the rate of about 10 per cent. of their daily potential capacity, and the average throughout the year, it was found, had been and would be substantially less than this figure. The highest percentage of the daily potential ever taken over a period of one month for all of the wells of Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation has been 6. 53 per cent. The wells of other pipe line owners in these fields have likewise been produced at low percentages of capacity. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] (a) Chapter 28, Acts 1931, Forty-Second Legislature, First Called Session (Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 6049a), known as the Common Purchaser Act, was construed and applied by the Railroad Commission as requiring private pipe line companies engaged theretofore only in producing and transporting gas from their own leases to purchase without discrimination, under regulations of the commission, quantities of gas offered them by producers in the field lacking their own pipe lines. The act was held unconstitutional as in violation of the due process and commerce clauses of the Federal Constitution, and enforcement of the orders was enjoined, in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (D.C .) 59 F.(2d) 750.\n  (b) Purporting to act under the general conservation laws of the State, as amended by chapter 26, Acts 1931, Forty-Second Legislature, First Called Session, the Railroad Commission subsequently issued orders completely closing down some portions of the Panhandle field, and limiting production from pipe line companies' wells in other portions. Enforcement of these orders was enjoined on the ground that the commission's action was ultra vires, in Texoma Natural Gas Co. v. Terrell (D.C.) 2 F.Supp. 168.\n  (c) By chapter 2, Acts 1932, Forty-Second Legislature, Fourth Called Session, the Railroad Commission was meantime authorized, whenever the full production from wells producing gas from a common reservoir should exceed reasonable market demand, to limit production to such demand and allocate the allowable production. Orders purporting to be issued under the authority of this act were enjoined in Canadian River Gas Co. v. Terrell (D.C.) 4 F.Supp. 222, on the ground that they were ultra vires because the statute authorized regulation only to prevent waste, and the court concluded that the orders did not bear any reasonable relation to that end.\n  (d) Then followed the enactment of the statute now under consideration. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] As amended by chapter 88, Acts 1933, Forty-Third Legislature, First Called Session. Compare F. C. Henderson, Inc., v. Railroad Commission (D.C .) 56 F. (2d) 218; Sneed v. Phillips Petroleum Co. (C.C.A.) 76 F.(2d) 785.  \n[\nFootnote 10\n] According to evidence presented by the State, in July, 1935, before the prohibitions of House Bill 266 became effective against uses therein declared wasteful, there were in the West Panhandle field 41 stripping plants producing natural gasoline, consuming daily 1,847,339 M.C. F. sweet gas, from which the gasoline production saved only 3 per cent. of the fuel value of the gas in its original state. Between February 1, 1933, and August 1, 1935, 709 billion cubic feet of gas were said to have been blown into the air after the natural gasoline content had been extracted. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 'Section 1. Declaration of policy: In recognition of past, present, and imminent evils occurring in the production and use of natual (natural) gas, as a result of waste in the production and use thereof in the absence of correlative opportunities of owners of gas in a common reservoir to produce and use the same, this law is enacted for the protection of public and private interests against such evils by prohibiting waste and compelling ratable production.'\n'Sec. 11. The Commission shall exercise the authority to accomplish the purpose designated under item (a) of Section 10 when the presence or imminence of waste is supported by a finding based \n\n upon the evidence introduced at a hearing to be held as herein provided.\n'The Commission shall exercise the authority to accomplish the purpose designated under item (b) of Section 10 when evidence introduced at a hearing to be held as herein provided will support a finding made by the Commission that the aggregate lawful volume of the open flow or daily potential capacity to produce of all gas wells located in a common reservoir, is in excess of the daily reasonable market demand for gas from gas wells that may be produced from such common reservoir, to be utilized as permitted in this Article.\n\n'Sec. 12. On or before the twentieth (20th) day of each calendar month the Commission shall hold a hearing * * * for the purpose of determining the aggregate daily capacity to produce of all gas wells in a common reservoir, and as nearly as possible, the daily volume of gas from each common reservoir that will be produced from gas wells during the following month to be utilized as permitted in this Article. Upon such determination, the Commission, based upon evidence introduced at such hearing, shall allocate to each gas well producing gas from such common reservoir a percentage of the daily productive capacity of each well which may be produced daily during the following month from each gas well producing gas from such common reservoir. Such percentage of the daily producing capacity \n\n of each well shall be regarded as its daily allowable production of such daily volume required for utilization from such common reservoir. * * *\n'Sec. 14. It shall be the duty of the Commission, after notice and hearing, to ascertain and determine the reasonable market demand for gas from gas wells to be used for light and fuel purposes and for all other lawful purposes to which sweet gas may be put under the terms of this Article and by proper order to restrict the production of gas from all gas wells in said field producing such gas to an amount equal to market demand or to an amount which may be produced without waste as otherwise defined; provided, however, the production of such gas shall in any event be restricted to the amount of the reasonable market demand therefor. In such order the Commission shall allocate, distribute or apportion the total allowable production from such field among the various gas wells affected by the order on a reasonable basis, and as provided in Section 13. * * *\n\n'Sec. 16. It shall be unlawful for any person to produce gas from a gas well as herein defined in excess of the daily allowable production in such schedule of allowable production. * * *\n\n'Sec. 20. In the event the Commission finds that the owner of any gas well has failed or refused to utilize or sell the allowable production from his well when such owner has been offered a connection or market for such gas at a reasonable price, such well shall be excluded from consideration in allocating the daily allowable production from the reservoir or zone in which same is located until the owner thereof signifies to the Commission his desire to utilize or sell such gas. In all other cases all gas wells shall be taken into account in allocating the allowable production among wells producing the same type of gas.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Texoma Natural Gas Company (with an affiliate) has, at a cost of about $72,000,000, acquired 200,000 acres of leases in the West Panhandle field known to be capable of producing sweet gas; drilled about 90 wells; erected a compressor plant; constructed a pipe line to its Chicago market; and secured marketing contracts for distribution in other States. Similarly, the Consolidated Gas Utilities Company (with affiliates) has expended a smaller sum in acquiring and developing gas reserves in the East Panhandle field and in constructing pipe lines to, and securing contracts for marketing its gas in Kansas. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Section 59a of article 16 of the Constitution of Texas, which article was proclaimed October 2, 1917, provides, in part:\n'The conservation and development of all of the natural resources of this State * * * and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources of the State are each and all hereby declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] House Bill 266 amends article 6008 of the Revised Civil Statutes, which is the statute particularly dealing with the production and use of natural gas. That article was amended by chapter 26 of Acts of 1931, Forty- Second Legislature, First Called Session, p. 46,  2. It was again amended by chapter 100 of the Acts of 1933, called the 'Sour Gas Law,' Forty-Third Legislature, Regular Session, p. 222; also by chapter 88 of the Acts of 1933, Forty-Third Legislature, First Called Session, p. 229, which remained in force until August 1, 1935, when House Bill 266 became effective.  \n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Texas Co. v.

Robert C. Alston and Wm. Hart Sibley, both of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. O. H. Dukes, of Atlanta, Ga., and L. W. Branch, of Quitman, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by tobacco warehousemen to restrain the enforcement of a statute of Georgia, approved March 28, 1935, fixing maximum charges for handling and selling leaf tobacco. Ga.Laws 1935, pp. 476-478.\n The statute was assailed as an arbitrary and capricious exercise of state power, repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, and as placing a direct burden upon interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause. The hearing in the District Court was by three judges (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 U.S.C.A.  380)) and, upon findings, of fact and conclusions of law, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill of complaint, one judge dissenting. The case comes here on appeal.\n The facts found by the District Court with respect to the tobacco industry in Georgia and the nature of the transactions at the warehouses are not in dispute. It appears that this industry is relatively new, beginning in 1917, but by the year 1925 it was becoming well established. The type of tobacco grown in Georgia is the 'bright leaf' which is almost exclusively used in the manufacture of cigarettes. This variety is grown extensively in North Carolina, to a much less extent in South Carolina and Georgia, and to some extent in Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The acreage planted by the individual farmer in Georgia is comparatively small, but the aggregate acreage is now not only very considerable but is widely distributed over a large area in the southern portion of the state.\n The necessity for markets and the early maturity of the tobacco in Georgia presented an opportunity which \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n was early recognized by experienced and skilled warehousemen who were operating in the tobacco belts of North Carolina and other states, where selling seasons began some time after the termination of the selling season in Georgia. With few exceptions, competent warehousemen, and experienced and skilled auctioneers and helpers in handling and selling tobacco are not found in Georgia and must be obtained from other states. There were forty-five warehouses operated in 1935, thirty-nine of which were connected in some capacity with warehouses in North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, or Tennessee.\n The principal purchasers of the bright leaf tobacco grown in Georgia and elsewhere are limited to a few large manufacturers of cigarettes. These are called 'the Companies.' They purchase tobacco only at warehouse auction sales to which they send or furnish 'buyers.' Each buyer is the representative of one of the competing purchasers and a 'set of buyers,' usually from eight to twelve in number, is made up of representatives from each of the purchasing cigarette manufacturers. The presence of a 'set of buyers' is essential at an auction sale. A town having one or more warehouses is known as a 'market.' By sending a set of buyers to a new warehouse, the manufacturers may recognize a new market, and by refusing to send one to a old market may cause its abandonment; and by sending either one or two sets of buyers to a given market the manufacturers may determine the rapidity with which the accumulated tobacco may be disposed of. There is another class of purchasers known as 'speculators.' these on rare occasions buy tobacco from a grower and have it transported to a warehouse for sale. At auction sales speculators to a limited extent, as compared with buyers, purchase tobacco for a later sale. There is strenuous and expensive competition between warehousemen in securing tobacco from growers to be \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n handled and sold, but in the sale of tobacco there is no competition except such as exists between the respective buyers and speculators at the auction sales, and the bids of the warehousemen themselves.\n The tobacco belt in Georgia comprises about twenty counties in the southern part of the state, and in 1935 there were fifteen towns known as 'markets.' Seven of the markets were supplied with one set of buyers and eight were furnished two sets. The 'two set markets' had a total of thirty and the 'one set markets' a total of fifteen warehouses in operation. The quantity of tobacco sold in the warehouses and the average prices ranged from 106,483,019 pounds at 9.86 cents per pound in 1930, to 71,826,352 pounds at 18.91 cents per pound in 1935\n\n\n After the tobacco has been cured and is ready for the market, the grower grades it as best he can and the resulting 'piles' of loose leaves are placed in sheets which are then tied and the tobacco is so transported to the selected warehouse for sale. Auction sales are held daily during five days of the week, and in any particular warehouse as often as sufficient tobacco accumulates. It is essential that there be present the warehousman, an auctioneer, and other skilled help, and one set of buyers. The warehouseman makes the opening bid. If this is not taken or raised by another, the warehouseman generally becomes the purchaser of the tobacco for his own account. If not sold in that fashion, the bidding continues until the sale is announced. The grower or other owner may turn down the sale and in such case he may hold the tobacco for a later sale or remove it. After the sale has been completed, the tobacco is delivered to the purchaser who removes it from the floor. The purchaser has it reweighed and pays the warehouseman. The warehouseman then pays the seller the purchase price, less warehouse charges. Tobacco purchased by the warehouseman is afterwards sold by him at auction. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n The tobacco is ready for the market in the latter part of July or early in August. The exact date for opening the selling season is fixed by the manufacturers, who are the principal buyers, and the warehousemen. The selling season is from three to five weeks in length. The short tobacco season causes growers to rush tobacco to the market and does not give them a fair opportunity 'to properly grade, store, bundle, and orderly market their tobacco.' The short season is in large part occasioned by the efforts of the manufacturers to transfer their buyers to the North Carolina belts, in some of which the selling seasons begin early in September, and the efforts of the warehousemen to dispose of the tobacco in Georgia so that they and their auctioneers and other skilled employees may proceed to the later and larger seasons of North Carolina and other states.\n When the act in question was passed, the warehouse charges, based upon three elements, the sale value, the number of piles handled, and the weight of the quantity sold, were as follows:\n Commissions: 2 1\/2 per cent. on gross sales.\n Auction fees: 25 cents per pile up to 200 pounds; 50 cents per pile above 200 pounds.\n Weighing and handling fees: 25 cents per pile up to 100 pounds, and 25 cents for each additional 100 pounds.\n The act of 1935 prescribed the following maximum charges:\n Commissions: 2 1\/2 per cent. on gross sales.\n Auction fees: 15 cents on all piles of 100 pounds or less; 25 cents on all piles over 100 pounds.\n Weighing and handling fees: 10 cents per pile of 100 pounds or less, and 10 cents for each additional 100 pounds.\n It will be observed that the statutory reduction is confined to the auction fees and the charges for weighing and handling. The percentage reduction is difficult of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n exact determination. Complainants say that the gross income of the warehousemen will be reduced about 20 per cent. The difference in dollars between the amount which complainants would have received in 1935 under the former schedule and the amount of which they would be entitled under the act is found to be $115,920.90, and this amount was paid into the registry of the court. Statutes in North Carolina and South Carolina fix the same scale of charges as those prescribed by the Georgia act. No attack has been made upon the constitutionality of these statutes. The scale heretofore in effect in Georgia 'is not so high as the non-statutory Tennessee or Kentucky charges.'\n The District Court made additional findings, which appellants challenge, with respect to the control exercised by the warehousemen over the charges mae for their services and their common agreement as to the amount of these charges. The court found that by reason of their control of the warehouses 'warehousemen have, unless regulated by law, as unduly coercive control over the prices charged the growers for services'; that beginning with the tobacco selling season of 1927 all warehousemen in Georgia have uniformly maintained 'a hard and fast schedule of charges'; that, while there have been some exceptions, they are 'so insignificant as to be immaterial'; that prior to 1927 the warehousemen in Georgia for many years, if not from the beginning of the industry, 'had maintained and exacted from sellers of tobacco a uniform schedule of charges substantially, if not identically, the same as the schedule fixed by the Act of 1935.'\n The court also found that the propriety of charging more for handling tobacco in Georgia than in the Carolinas had not been established; that it had not been shown that the Georgia act 'was passed without any knowledge on the part of the legislature as to actual con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n ditions under which the business was, and is, being carried on in Georgia'; that it had not been proved 'what each or any warehouseman, individual or corporate, lost in revenue by reason of the scale of charges prescribed by the act'; that it was not denied 'that some warehousemen earned a satisfactory profit' and it had not been proved that where a loss occurred it was not due 'to excessive competition, ill-advised loans, unnecessary expenses in buying influence or hauling customers' tobacco, or other causes than the reduction in charges.' The court observed that the testimony as to the effects of the act was with respect to the 'group of warehousemen who are complainants, rather than to the effect on each one, and even then it was not proven that all the losses are traceable to the reduction in charges rather than to other causes.'\n The court made findings with regard to the organization known as the 'Tobacco Warehousemen's Association' of which all the complainants were members. The court said that the prosecution of the suit was 'an organized fight through the Warehousemen's Association'; that the growers are not eligible for membership in that organization; that 'the Association and the buyers determine the date the market in Georgia opens and substantially determine the date on which it closes'; that the Association undertakes to deal with such practices as affect the interest of the members and adopt rules which they are to observe. The court quoted from the minutes of meetings certain action tending to support the view that there was a common agreement as to warehouse charges and a concert of action in relation to the present suit. The court concluded that 'through the Warehousemen's Association and their common agreement' as to charges the complainants 'maintain and enjoy a virtual monopoly in the field covered by their operations'; that the business of tobacco warehousemen in Georgia in 1935, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n and for some years prior thereto, was such as to cause it to be 'affected with a public interest'; that the scale of charges prescribed by the act was 'not unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious,' but was 'reasonably adapted to accomplish the desired result'; and that the fixing of charges for the services rendered by the warehousemen did 'not burden or interfere with interstate commerce.'\n First. Unless there is conflict with the authority of the Congress over interstate commerce, the enactment of the statute was clearly within the competency of the Georgia Legislature. While appellants' assignment of errors challenge the conclusion of the District Court that the business of the tobacco warehouses was one 'affected with a public interest,' their counsel conceded in the argument at bar that the challenge could not be sustained. That concession was appropriate in view of the evidence and the findings. The uncontroverted facts with respect to the nature and extent of the tobacco industry, the establishment of markets for public sales, and the dependence of the industry upon the services of the warehousemen in connection with these sales, show beyond cavil the public interest in these markets and in the maintenance of reasonable charges for the services there rendered.\n A similar conception of public interest, reenforced by abundant experience, is reflected in the legislation of other tobacco growing states. In Virginia the sale of tobacco in public warehouses has long been regulated by statute and maximum charges have been fixed. Code of Virginia 1887,  1820-1825; 1924,  1376-1381. In North Carolina such regulation goes back to an early day. See Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina,  5124 et seq. In Gray v. Central Warehouse Co., 181 N.C. 166, 106 S.E. 657, 660, the Supreme Court of that state, after summarizing the local legislation upon that subject since 1895, goes on to say: \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n 'Indeed, as far back as the history of the state extends the business of tobacco warehouses has been, if not a public duty, always 'affected with a public use.' The laws of North Carolina from 1669 to 1790 have been compiled as State Records, vols. 23, 24, and 25, by the writer of this opinion (Chief Justice Clark), and in the index thereto, in the last-named volume, it appears that no less than 75 statutes were enacted prior to 1790 in regard to tobacco warehouses requiring inspection, regulation, and fixing charges in such business. To the fullest extent, therefore, their regulation and control by the public has been recognized and enforced in this state. In fact, there is no subject in which the protection of the producers against extortion and combinations to reduce prices is more important.'\n In South Carolina maximum charges for selling leaf tobacco upon the floor of tobacco warehouses are fixed. Code, South Carolina 1932,  7197, and earlier statutes there cited. The statute of Georgia, here under attack, copies almost exactly the South Carolina statute. See, also as to the authority of the state, Nash v. Page, 80 Ky. 539, 44 Am.Rep. 490; Pannell v. Louisville Tobacco Warehouse Company, 113 Ky. 630, 68 S.W. 662, 82 S.W. 1141.\n So far as the present controversy turns upon the power of the state to give this sort of protection to this industry, provided its regulation is not arbitrary or confiscatory and in the absence of conflict with the federal power over commerce, our rulings are decisive in support of the state action. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n; Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517\n, 12 S.Ct. 468; Brass v. Stoeser \n153 \nU.S. 391\n, 14 S.Ct. 857; German Alliance Insurance Company v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A.1915C, 1189; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n Confiscation is not shown. The presumption of reasonableness has not been overthrown. O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Insurance Co., supra. It is apparent \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 451]\n\u00a0\n that the return to the warehousemen will largely be governed by the volume and value of the tobacco crop. The evidence relates chiefly to the years of the great depression and affords no appropriate criterion for a more normal period. Moreover, we find no sufficient ground for disturbing the finding of the District Court that the evidence did not satisfactorily establish what any warehouseman, individual or corporate, lost by reason of the prescribed scale of charge in contradistinction to its effect upon the warehousemen as a group. See AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 448 S., 48 S.Ct. 174, 176, 177. The burden resting upon appellants to make a convincing showing that the statutory rates would operate so severely as to deprive them, respectively, of their property without due process of law, was not sustained. AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, supra; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 634; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 164\n, 54 S.Ct. 658, 663; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 298\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 651.\n Appellants contend that the legislative action was taken without investigation and hence must be considered to be arbitrary and beyond the legislative power. There is no principle of constitutional law which nullifies action taken by a legislature, otherwise competent, in the absence of a special investigation. The result of particular legislative inquiries through commissions or otherwise may be most helpful in portraying the exigencies to which the legislative action has been addressed and in fortifying conclusions as to reasonableness. Nebbia v. New York, supra, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, at page 516 et seq., 54 S.Ct. 505, 507, et seq., 89 A.L.R. 1469. But the Legislature, acting within its sphere, is presumed to know the needs of the people of the state. Whether or not special inquiries should be made is a matter for the legislative discretion. Here, the existence of the industry, highly important to the state, the transactions in the tobacco markets, the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 452]\n\u00a0\n necessity of protecting the growers from exorbitant warehouse charges, must be presumed to have been fully known to the members of the Legislature and this presumption cannot be overthrown, as it has been sought to be overthrown, by testimony of individual legislators.\n Second. The main contention of appellants is that the state had no power to enact the regulation as it attempted to govern transactions in the course of interstate and foreign commerce. Appellants urge that practically all the tobacco grown in Georgia is shipped out of the state, about 40 per cent. in foreign, and the remaining 60 per cent. in interstate, commerce; that the purchasers at the 'markets' in Georgia for the most part are manufacturers of cigarettes who immediately have the tobacco transported to their plants outside the state; that the purchases made by speculators and warehousemen are for the purpose of resale as soon as possible to the cigarette manufacturers, and thus that the tobacco so brought, as well as the rest, 'is destined for interstate or foreign shipment.'\n We find it unnecessary to pass upon the authority of the Congress to regulate the charges of the warehousemen, for we are of the opinion that, if it be assumed that Congress has that authority, it has not been exercised and in the absence of such exercise the state may impose the regulation in question for the protection of its people.\n The federal statute, to which appellants refer, is the 'Tobacco Inspection Act' of August 23, 1935. 49 Stat. 731 (7 U.S.C.A.  511 et seq .). That statute, while declaring the transactions in tobacco at auction markets to be 'affected with a public interest' (section 2 (7 U.S.C.A.  511a)) had a limited objective. It did not undertake to regulate the charges of warehousemen or in any way to derogate from the existing state legislation upon that subject. It sought to aid tobacco growers by establishing and promoting the use of standards of classification and by maintaining an official inspection service. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 453]\n\u00a0\n It was found that the farmer had 'no definite system of grades of his own,' that the private grading systems used by the buyers were kept 'strictly confidential' so that 'without Government standards the farmer has no definite guide for sorting his tobacco,' and that hence 'farmers generally are unable to class their tobacco correctly to meet the trade's demands'.1 To meet this need, the act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to make investigations and to establish standards for tobacco 'by which its type, grade, size, condition, or other characteristics' might be determined ( section 3 (7 U.S.C.A.  511b)). It authorized the Secretary to designate auction markets, on determining 'by referendum the desire of tobacco growers,' but it was also provided that the act should not be construed as preventing transactions in tobacco at markets not so designated (section 5 ( 7 U.S.C.A.  511d)). It authorized the Secretary, independently or in co- operation with other branches of the government, state agencies, or others, to employ the license competent persons as samplers or weighers, but it was added that this provision was 'intended merely to provide for the furnishing or services upon request of the owner or other person financially interested in tobacco to be sampled, inspected, or weighed,' and should 'not be construed otherwise' (section 6 (7 U.S.C.A.  511e)). And the Secretary was further authorized, in order to carry out the purposes of the act, to 'cooperate with any other Department or agency of the Government; any State, territory, district, or possession,' as well as with purchasing and consuming organizations, boards of trade, etc. ( section 14 (7 U.S.C.A.  511m)).\n The Congress, as the reports of the committees in both Houses show,2 was fully conversant with the manner in which the transactions in tobacco were carried on. It \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 454]\n\u00a0\n cannot be doubted that the Congress was well aware of the long-established legislation in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the more recent legislation in Georgia, prescribing maximum charges for the services of warehousemen. We deem it to be highly significant that, in the light of existing practices and statutory regulations, the Congress carefully restricted its own requirements and did not attempt to interfere with the operation of state laws as to the amounts which warehousemen might charge. The purpose and terms of the federal statute negative any such intention. It is inconceivable that the Congress in endeavoring to aid the tobacco growers in sorting or 'grading,' and thus to facilitate the marketing of their tobacco, intended to deprive them of the protection they already had against extortionate charges of the warehousemen upon whom they depended in making their sales. Instead of frustrating the operation of such state laws, the provisions of the act expressly afforded and emphasized the opportunity for cooperation with the states in protecting the farmers' interests. In this view we find no ground for the contention that Congress has taken possession of the field of regulation to the exclusion of state laws which do not conflict with its own requirements.\n The case calls for the application of the well-established principle that Congress may circumscribe its regulation and occupy a limited field, and that the intent to supersede the exercise by the state of its police power as to matters not covered by the federal legislation is not to be implied unless the latter fairly interpreted is in actual conflict with the state law. Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 293\n, 294 S., 34 S. Ct. 829; Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170; Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118, 122\n, 39 S.Ct. 403; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Public Utility Commissioners, \n278 \nU.S. 24, 35\n, 49 S.Ct. 69, 72, 62 A.L.R. 805; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 455]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 380, 392\n, 393 S., 51 S.Ct. 553, 556; Hartford Indemnity Co. v. Illinois, \n298 \nU.S. 155, 158\n, 56 S.Ct. 685, 686.\n Laying on one side the federal statute, as in no way inconsistent, we find no ground for concluding that the state requirements lay any actual burden upon interstate or foreign commerce. The Georgia act does not attempt to fix the prices at the auction sales or to regulate the activities of the purchasers. The fixing of reasonable maximum charges for the services of the warehousemen in aid of the tobacco growers does not militate against any interest of those who buy. They pay the bid price, as accepted, and the warehouseman pays the seller, deducting from the purchase price the warehouse charges.\n We are thus brought to the final contention of appellants that the state law, although not in conflict with any exertion of federal authority, must fall as being repugnant to the existence of an exclusive federal power although unexercised. The contention ignores the principle that this ground of invalidity is to be found only with respect to such matters as demand a general system or uniformity of regulation; that in other matters, admitting of diversity of treatment according to the special requirements of local conditions, the states may act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319; Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 400 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S.Ct. 548, 549; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 390\n, 52 S.Ct. 581, 585.\n In the instant case, the Georgia statute deals with a local need, exercising the state's protective power with respect to its own industry. A similar contention to that now advanced was held untenable in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, where state regulation of charges by the proprietors of grain elevators was sustained despite the fact that the elevators were used as instrumentalities by those \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 456]\n\u00a0\n who engaged in interstate commerce Id., \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, at page 135. The point was again raised and overruled in Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517\n, 12 S.Ct. 468, 469, in upholding the New York statute regulating charges for 'elevating, trimming, receiving, weighing, and discharging grain by means of floating and stationery elevators and warehouses.' It was recognized that, in the actual state of the business, the passage of the grain to the city of New York and other places on the seaboard without the use of elevators would be practically impossible. The elevator at Buffalo was a link in the chain of transportation of the grain from the places where it was grown to the seaboard, but the Court said: 'So far as the statute in question is a regulation of commerce, it is a regulation of commerce only on the waters of the state of New York. It operates only within the limits of that state, and is no more obnoxious as a regulation of interstate commerce than was the statute of Illinois in respect to warehouses, in Munn v. Illinois. It is of the same character with navigation laws in respect to navigation within the state, and laws regulating wharfage rates within the state, and other kindred laws.' Id., \n143 \nU.S. 517\n, at pages 544, 545, 12 S.Ct. 468. Again, in Brass v. North Dakota, \n153 \nU.S. 391\n, 14 S.Ct. 857, the statute of that state 'regulating grain warehouses and weighing and handling of grain' was held not to amount to a regulation of commerce between the states in the absence of a conflict with federal legislation, upon the authority of the Munn nad Budd Cases.\n In W. W. Cargill Company v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 21 S.Ct. 423, the requirement of a state license for grain warehouses on railroad rights of way was found to be not inconsistent with the power of the Congress, although the warehouse company purchased the grain, handled in or shipped from its warehouse, for the purpose of transporting it as its property to its terminal elevators in Wisconsin and Illinois and thence to other points in the eastern states. Id., \n180 \nU.S. 452\n, at page \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 457]\n\u00a0\n 462, 21 S.Ct. 423, 429. The Court thus stated the reasons for this conclusion: 'The statute puts no obstacle in the way of the purchase by the defendant company of grain in the state or the shipment out of the state of such grain as it purchased. The license has reference only to the business of the defendant at its elevator and warehouse. The statute only requires a license in respect of business conducted at an established warehouse in the state between the defendant and the sellers of grain. ... In no real or substantial sense is such commerce obstructed by the requirement of a license.' See, also, Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365, 368\n, 39 S.Ct. 114.\n Even where the federal government has intervened, as in the United States Warehousing Act of August 11, 1916 (as amended), 7 U.S.C.. c. 10,  241 et seq. (7 U.S.C.A.  241 et seq.), in providing for licenses for warehouses where agricultural products are 'stored for interstate or foreign commerce' (section 2, as amended 7 U.S.C.A.  242), we held that the license did not convert the warehouseman into an instrumentality of the federal government and, while by means of the licensing provisions a measure of control over those engaged in the business was secured to the national government, still the license did not confer upon the warehouseman immunity from state taxation. Federal Compress Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 23 S., 54 S.Ct. 267, 269. That case was followed by our decision in Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 584\n, 54 S.Ct. 541, to the effect that the business of buying and selling cotton locally produced, processed, and warehoused was local in character, and that a local occupation tax upon the buyer did not contravene the commerce clause although the course of the business was such that all the cotton so bought was ultimately shipped by the buyer in interstate or foreign commerce. On similar grounds we held in Minnesota v. Blasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 54 S.Ct. 34, 36, that because there was 'a flow of interstate commerce' which was subject to the regulating power of the Congress it did not necessarily follow that, in the absence of a con- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 458]\n\u00a0\n flict with the exercise of that power, a state might not lay a nondiscriminatory tax upon property which 'although connected with that flow as a general course of business' had come to rest and acquired a situs within the state.\n All these decisions but illustrate the principle that the mere existence of the congressional power, no conflict with its exercise being shown, does not deprive the states of their authority to safeguard their local interests by legislation which does not directly burden transactions in interstate or foreign commerce.\n The cases upon which appellants rely are distinguishable. In Dahnke- Walker Company v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, the statute held to be invalid imposed burdensome conditions upon the enforcement of rights arising from transactions in interstate commerce. In Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Co., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, 42 S.Ct. 244, the North Dakota statute of 1919 (Laws 1919, c. 138) disclosed a comprehensive scheme to regulate the buying of grain in the course of interstate commerce. Such purchases could be made only by those who held licenses from the state, paid state charges for the same, and acted under a system of grading, inspecting and weighing fully defined in the act. The grain could only be purchased subject to the power of the state grain inspector to determine the margin of profit which the buyer could realize upon his purchase. That margin of profit was defined to be the difference between the price paid at the North Dakota elevator and the market price, with an allowance for freight, at the Minnesota points to which the grain was shipped and sold. The state officer was thus authorized to 'fix and determine the price' to be paid for grain which was 'bought, shipped, and sold in interstate commerce.' That the provision was a regulation of interstate commerce was said to be 'obvious from its mere statement.' Id., \n258 \nU.S. 50\n, at pages 56-58, 42 S.Ct. 244, 247. The later North Dakota statute of 1923 fell under a like condemnation in \n\n[301 \nU.S. 441, 459]\n\u00a0\n Shafer v. Farmers' Grain Company, \n268 \nU.S. 189\n, 45 S.Ct. 481, as the statute subjected the buying for interstate shipment to conditions and a measure of control which caused a direct interference with interstate commerce.\n Here, the Georgia act lays no constraint upon purchases in interstate commerce, does not attempt to fix the prices or conditions of purchases, or the profit of the purchasers. It simply seeks to protect the tobacco growers from unreasonable charges of the warehousemen for their services to the growers in handling and selling the tobacco for their account. Whatever relation these transactions had to interstate and foreign commerce, the effect is merely incidental and imposes no direct burden upon that commerce. The state is entitled to afford its industry this measure of protection until its requirement is superseded by valid federal regulation. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Report of the House Committee on Agriculture, H.R.Rep.

The case will be stated.\n  July 22, 1924, a national bank at Kingwood, W. Va., was designated by the bankruptcy court of that district as a depository for funds of bankrupt estates, subject to the requirement that the bank give a bond in the [ U.S. ex rel. Wilhelm v. Chain   \n300 \nU.S. 31\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 32]\n\u00a0\n\npenal sum of $5,000 and that the bond have the court's approval. Later in the same month the bond was given by the bank and approved by the court. Thereupon the bank became an authorized depository, and it continued to be such, without giving any further bond, until June 22, 1931, when it failed.\n  The bond was under seal; named the United States as obligee; was signed by the bank and two individual sureties, as obligors; declared that the obligors were thereby binding themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, and successors, jointly and severally; recited the designation of the bank as a depository; and was conditioned for the faithful discharge and performance by the bank of all duties pertaining to it as a depository.\n  Between August 12, 1930, and June 22, 1931, Charles P. Wilhelm, as trustee for the estate of W. H. Pentony, a bankrupt, deposited in the bank, as a designated depository, various sums of money belonging to that estate, and made authorized withdrawals, with the result that, of the deposits so made, there remained in the bank on June 22, 1931, a balance of $3,190.72 to the credit of the trustee. On that day the bank became insolvent, closed its doors, refused to pay to the trustee the balance so owing to the bankrupt estate, and thereby broke the condition of its bond.\n  In March, 1926, which was after the bond was given and approved and before Wilhelm, trustee, made any deposit in the bank, James W. Flynn, one of the sureties on the bond, died and Nellie Flynn Chain became executrix of his estate. Flynn did not at any time during his life seek to revoke or terminate his suretyship; nor did his executrix subsequently take any step to that end.\n  The action on the bond was in the name of the United States for the use of Wilhelm, trustee, and was brought \n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 33]\n\u00a0\n against the bank, the surviving surety and the executrix of the deceased surety.\n  The District Court gave judgment against the defendants for the balance due Wilhelm, trustee. The executrix of the deceased surety appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment as to the estate of that surety. Chain v. Wilhelm (C.C.A.) 84 F.(2d) 138. Certiorari was granted by this Court, United States, for Use and Benefit of Wilhelm, v. Chain, \n299 \nU.S. 531\n.\n  Pertinent statutes and a related general bankruptcy order are copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n  The crucial question for decision, as was said by the Court of Appeals, is whether the obligation of an individual surety on such a depository bond terminates with his death. That court answered in the affirmative, one judge dissenting. It likened such a bond to a continuing guaranty whereby the guarantor, without present \n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 34]\n\u00a0\n consideration, guarantees a series of future performances, such as payment of the purchase price of goods to be sold, or repayment of money to be advanced, from time to time in the future; and it applied the usual rule that such a guaranty is merely an offer and does not ripen into a contract in respect of any sale or advance until the same is made, and that the guaranty, in so far as it remains merely an offer, may be revoked by the guarantor and is terminated by his death. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n  The court rightly recognized that a continuing guaranty, if supported at the outset by a sufficient consideration, is a binding contract which is neither revocable by the guarantor nor terminable by his death, although the acts guaranteed may cover a long or indefinite priod of time. 3 But it pronounced this rule inapplicable because it regarded the bond as more nearly analogous to a continuing guaranty without present consideration.\n  We are of opinion that the bond was not a mere offer but was given upon a present and sufficient consideration, and therefore became a binding contract when it was delivered to and approved by the bankruptcy court. The inducement, as also the occasion, for the bond was the designation of the bank as a depository. This was a present, adequate, and indivisible consideration. \n4\n Without the bond the bank would not have been \n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 35]\n\u00a0\n entitled to the advantages of the designation; while with the bond it was entitled to them. In this regard the bond was like that of a collector of customs, county treasurer, sheriff, clerk of court, administrator, guardian, or cashier, as to which it is well settled that the selection of the officer or employee whose fidelity is assured constitutes a present consideration amply supporting the undertaking of the obligors-sureties as well as principals. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n'It is a presumption of law that the parties to a contract bind not only themselves but their personal representatives. Executors, therefore, are held to be liable on all contracts of the testator which are broken in his lifetime, and, with the exception of contracts in which personal skill or taste is required, on all contracts broken after his death.'6\n\n  The bond in suit is a contract for the conditional payment of money, not the exercise of personal skill or taste, and therefore is one to which the presumption applies. No doubt it is admissible to restrict the presumption by a stipulation limiting a surety's obligation to defaults occurring within his lifetime, but the present bond does not contain such a stipulation, or anything indicating that such a limitation was intended. On the contrary, its terms are in full accord with the presumption, for in it the obligors expressly declare their purpose to bind not only themselves, but also their executors, administrators and successors, jointly and severally, for the performance of the obligation set forth.\n  In a long line of decisions relating to bonds not distinguishable from the one in suit it has been held that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 36]\n\u00a0\n a surety's obligation does not terminate with his death but binds his personal representatives for past and subsequent defaults, as it would bind him if living. \n7\n The principle underlying these decisions is the same that prevails in respect of other related contracts, and we regard it as well sustained in reason and supported by the preponderant weight of authority.\n  Cases are bought to our attention in which it is held that a surety may terminate his obligation as respects future defaults by giving notice to that effect to the obligee. But these cases are not apposite. In some the instrument sued upon was held to be only a continuing offer without a supporting consideration and therefore revocable as to future transactions. Others rest upon a power so to terminate expressly reserved in the bond or in the applicable statute. Here the bond is a binding contract supported by an adequate consideration, and there is no reservation of a right to terminate in the bond or in the statute under which it was given. Nor has there been any effort to effect such a termination.\n  Whether the bankruptcy court may, upon appropriate application and showing, discharge a surety on an existing bond, as respects possible future defaults, and require the depository to give another and substituted bond, need not be considered, for no such application or showing appears to have been attempted. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 31\n, 37]\n\u00a0\n  While the bond was under seal we need not consider the effect to be given to this under the local law, for it affirmatively appears that the bond was given for a present and adequate consideration, which leads to the same result as if the seal were given the effect which would be accorded to it at common law.\n  It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bankruptcy Act of 1898.\n  Sec. 47a Trustees shall respectively * * * (3) deposit all money received by them in one of the designated depositories; (4) disburse money only by check or draft on the depositories in which it has been deposited.

Public Service Company,' under date of 'Jul 25 '33' in the column bearing the printed heading 'Balance,' being the fifth entry from the top of the column aforesaid, and directly opposite the machine printed date thereon 'July 25 33,' a certain false entry in the following figures, to wit, '7,874.07,' which said entry so made as aforesaid, purports to show and does in substance and effect indicate and declare that The Commercial National Bank of San Antonio, Texas, was indebted and liable to the San Antonio Public Service Company in the amount of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-Four \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 44]\n\u00a0\n Dollars and Seven Cents ($7,874.07) on July 25, 1933, whereas in truth and in fact said indebtedness and liability on said date was a different and much larger amount.'\n  Count 4 made a like charge relative to the account of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company.\n  He was tried, found guilty, and sentenced under both counts. The point for our decision is whether the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty. The essential facts are not in dispute.\n  From the evidence it appears-\n  Giles, once bookkeeper for the Commercial National Bank, became first paying and receiving teller with custody each day of some $35,000 cash. His duty was to receive deposits and place accompanying slips or tickets where they would reach the bookkeepers for entry. Eighteen months prior to the alleged offense, he discovered shortage in his cash but made no report to his superiors. To cover up the shortage he resorted to the practice of withholding selected deposit slips for three or four days before permitting them to reach the bookkeeping department. This caused the ledger to show false balances. Other shortages occurred; July 25, 1933, the total stood at $2,650.\n  On that day he accepted deposits with proper tickets from San Antonio Public Service Company and National Life & Accident Insurance Company for $ 1,985.79 and $663.27, respectively, accompanied by cash and checks. Together these approximated his shortage. He withheld both tickets from the place where they should have gone and secreted them. If placed as usual and as his duty required, they would have reached the bookkeeper during the day. Entries on the ledger would have shown the depositors' true balances.\n  The Bank closed July 29th. The slips never reached the bookkeeper. The individual ledger accounts at the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 45]\n\u00a0\n end of the 25th and thereafter understated the liability of the Bank to the depositors.\n  The respondent acknowledged his purpose in withholding the deposit tickets was to prevent officers and examiners from discovering his shortage. Some excerpts from his testimony are in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 46]\n\u00a0\n  At the conclusion of the evidence counsel moved for a directed verdict of not guilty. This was denied. The jury found guilt under both counts; an appeal, with many assignments of error, went to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  That court declared: 'The serious question presented for decision is whether the law will support a conviction on an indictment charging that defendant caused the false entries to be made.'\n'Of course, in a sense, one who makes a false entry causes it to be made. If he makes an entry himself or directs another to make it, an allegation in the indictment that he caused it to be made may be treated as surplusage and harmless, but where the defendant has neither made a false entry nor directed another to do so, the same allegation is material and injurious. A charge that one has caused a false entry to be made is very much broader than the charge that he made it.' 'We consider the allegation of the indictment, that defendant \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 47]\n\u00a0\n did 'cause to be made a certain false entry in a book of the bank,' charged a degree and classification of the offense not within the letter or intent of the law.' 'The evidence in the record conclusively shows that defendant neither made the false entries nor did anything that could be considered as a direction to the bookkeeper to make them. Without the charge that he caused the entries to be made he could not have been convicted. It follows that it was prejudicial error to overrule the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.'\n\n  Dissenting, one judge said:\n'This statute plainly intends to punish the falsification of bank records with intent to deceive or defraud. If false entries are deliberately produced, although through an ignorantly innocent agent, the bank em- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 48]\n\u00a0\n ployee who concocts the plan and achieves the result is, in my opinion, guilty. This innocent bookkeeper was the teller's real though unconscious agent in making the entries; as truly so as if the false entries had been requested in words.' 'The present case is not one of a mere failure to prevent a consequence, but is one of contriving that consequence and so fathering it as to make it wholly the contriver's own. The bookkeeper in making these false entries was doing the will of the teller, though he did not know it. The false entries are in law the acts of the teller who planned them and did all he needed to do to produce them.'\n\n  Counsel for the respondent now affirm: 'There is no dispute as to the facts.' 'The act committed by the defendant was the withholding by him and the failure by him to turn over to the Bookkeeping Department in the usual course of the bank's business a deposit slip.' He did not cause any false entry to be made. Personally he made no such entry; he did not affirmatively direct one. By withholding the ticket he prevented an entry; he caused none.\n  The rule, often announced, that criminal statutes must be strictly construed does not require that the words of an enactment be given their narrowest meaning or that the lawmaker's evident intent be disregarded. United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 242\n. Here the purpose to insure the correctness of bank records by prescribing punishment for any employee who, with intent to deceive, etc., deliberately brings about their falsification is plain enough. The statute denounces as criminal one who with intent, etc., 'makes any false entry.' The word 'make' has many meanings, among them 'To cause to exist, appear or occur,' Webster's International Dictionary, (2d Ed.). To hold the statute broad enough to include deliberate action from which a false entry by \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 49]\n\u00a0\n an innocent intermediary necessarily follows gives to the words employed their fair meaning and is in accord with the evident intent of Congress. To hold that it applies only when the accused personally writes the false entry or affirmatively directs another so to do would emasculate the statute-defeat the very end in view.\n  Morse v. United States, 174 F. 539, 547, 553, 20 Ann.Cas. 938-Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit-gave much consideration to an indictment and conviction under R.S.  5209. The court said: 'It is true that the defendant did not make any of the entries in the books or reports with his own pen. All of them were made by the employees of the bank as part of their routine work. If it were necessary to prove against a director that he actually made the entry charged to be false, conviction under the statute would be impossible, as these entries are invariably made by subordinates in the executive department. Congress was not seeking to punish the ignorant bookkeeper who copies items into the books as part of his daily task, but the officers who conceived and carried out the fraudulent scheme which the false entry was designed to conceal. It is wholly immaterial whether such officer acts through a pen or a clerk controlled by him.' It seems to us that defendant is as fully responsible for any false entries which necessarily result from the presentation of these pieces of paper which he caused to be prepared as he would if he had given oral instructions in reference to them or had written them himself.'\n  We agree with the view so expressed in that opinion. United States v. McClarty (D.C.) 191 F. 518 and 523, apparently is in conflict with our conclusion.\n  The record leaves us in no doubt that the false entries on the ledger were the intended and necessary result of respondent's deliberate action in withholding the deposit tickets. Within the statute he made them. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 41\n, 50]\n\u00a0\n  The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The District Court will be affirmed.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n300 \nU.S. 687\n, 81 L.Ed. -. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5209, R.S., title LXII, National Banks, c. 3: 'Every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent of any association, who embezzles, abstracts, or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds, or credits of the association; or who, without authority from the directors, issues or puts in circulation any of the notes of the association; or who, without such authority, issues or puts forth any certificate of deposit, draws any order or bill of exchange, makes any acceptance, assigns any note, bond, draft, bill of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree; or who makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of the association, with intent, in either case, to injure or defraud the association or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive any officer of the association, or any agent appointed to examine the affairs of any such association; and every person who with like intent aids or abets any officer, clerk, or agent in any violation of this section, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than ten.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'My actual shortage was $2,650.00 that had shown up without my having any responsibility for it. The only way it could be carried was holding out deposit tickets to offset the shortage in the cash, and on the 25th of July withholding these two deposits, the San Antonio Public Service and the National Life & Accident, and depositing the two tickets that had been held over from the 21st.\n'Asked if I selected those two deposit slips that day to withhold them because they, together, made up the amount of the shortage, that was the reason I selected those two, because it covered the amount of the shortage.\n\n'The bank got the money for both of those deposits. I did not make any false entries with reference to those items. It is true that all I did was simply put the deposit slips in the cigar box and withheld them for the time being, until I could recover the shortage. I did not make any report to any bookkeeper. As to how the bookkeeping department received its information on which they keep their books, the bookkeepers came in three or four times a day and lots of days oftener, and took the deposit tickets and checks out of the drawers. The business of the day was represented by the tickets and checks. I would put those in the drawers; I had a special drawer for them, divided into sections. As to whether I took them to the bookkeepers or they came to the drawers whenever they wanted to and get themthey came and got them whether I was there or not. I had no control or direction whatever over the bookkeeping department or any bookkeeper. Mr. Crowther had control and direction over the bookkeepers; really, Mr. Roberts handled them, but Mr. Crowther was over the bookkeepers. If the entries were made on any given date showing the balance of any depositors, etc., I did not have anything whatever to do with making the entries or causing them to be made. They simply came to the drawers and got the checks and deposit slips, and from that made up their entries. These two deposit slips that were withheld and stuck in the cigar box that day would have gone right on into the books in time if the bank had not closed. They were simply withheld that way to make my cash balance; that was the only way I had of doing that. I withheld deposit tickets from time to time in order that my cash shortage would not be discovered.\n\n'With regard to the two deposits that are directly in question in this case, one to the National Life & Accident Company and one to the San Antonio Public Service Company, each on the 25th of July, 1933, I withheld those two deposit tickets from the bookkeepers. Asked if instead of putting them in the drawer with the balance of the deposit tickets for that day, I put them in a different place where I knew the bookkeepers would not look for them, yes, sir, I put them in the cigar box. The bookkeepers had nothing to do with the cigar box. The bookkeepers would go to the regular place where the deposit slips were kept to get them. The reason I put the two deposit tickets in the cigar box was for the sole and only purpose of keeping them from the bookkeepers to keep them from going through, to keep them from going on the account of the depositors. \n\n  'Asked if by putting deposit slips in a place where he would not get them and I knew he would not get them, I had that much control over the bookkeepers, yes, sir, by holding them out, of course, he would not get them.\n'Q. Now, I show you one of the Government's Exhibits, which is the individual ledger account of the San Antonio Public Service Company in the right hand column, the 5th line from the top of the page, an entry under date of July 25th, 1933, under the column head 'new balance' which is the last balance of that account shown for July 25th, 1933, of $7,874.07; was that the true balance of that account on that date? A. That was the true balance of everything that went through to the account. Q. That is right, but was that a true balance on the account; do the figures, 7,874.07, represent the liability of the Commercial National Bank to the San Antonio Public Service Company at the close of business on July 25th, 1933? A. No, sir; the deposit slip was in my cage of $1,985.79.\n\n'Q. And then this entry of $7,874.07 is not correct, because you did not let the bookkeepers have the deposit ticket? A. We often held deposit tickets over. Q. But you withheld it for a purpose, didn't you? A. Yes, sir. Q. Your intention in withholding it was so that it would not go on the ledger sheet, wasn't it? A. Yes, sir; I put it in the cigar box.\n\n'I did not make any entries or figures of any sort from which the bookkeepers might have got it off the entries. The only entry I ever made was in the depositor's pass book. I therefore made no other entries.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Brien McMahon, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. J. Hughes, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U.S.C.  682 ( 18 U.S.C.A.  682).\n The second count of an indictment charged appellees with conspiracy to defraud the United States by furnishing false information and making false statements to the Secretary of Agriculture in order to secure benefit payments under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 31 (as amended, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq.), Criminal Code,  35, 37, 18 U.S.C.  80, 88 (18 U.S.C.A.  80, 88). The District Court sustained a demurrer to this count and the government appeals.\n The contention of the government is that the appellees conspired to cheat the United States by selling hogs to the government at premium prices through misrepresentation as to the identity of the producers of the hogs sold and the continued ownership by such producers. Appellees' demurrer went upon the ground, among others, that the provisions of the statute and the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture to which the count referred are void (United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914) and that the acts set forth in the indictment do not constitute an offense against the laws of the United States.\n The false claims statute under which the prosecution was brought penalizes one who 'for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding \n\n[302 \nU.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n the Government of the United States ... shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations.' Criminal Code,  35, 18 U.S.C.A.  80. After referring to the statute, the District Judge said in his opinion:\n'The overt acts charged, which would be material in this count, are that hogs were shipped under the representation by the defendants that they were the hogs of various producers when in fact the hogs belonged to one or more of the defendants.\n\n'There is no contention that the hogs were not shipped and that the bills, which were made to Armour and Company and other processors, were not correct bills, with the exception that the hogs did not originate from the sources represented by the defendants.\n\n'This ceases to be a material fact, if the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act are void. In other words, the representations, which are alleged to have been made, cease to be misrepresentations of material facts when the act itself falls'.\n\n\n 1. \nAppellees contend that, if any statute was construed, it was not the statute on which the indictment is founded and hence that this Court has no jurisdiction. The point is that the indictment charged a conspiracy under Criminal Code,  37 (18 U.S.C.A.  88). But the conspiracy charged is one to violate the false claims statute, Criminal Code,  35 (18 U.S.C. A.  80). In similar cases the jurisdiction of this Court has been sustained. The statute, at the violation of which the conspiracy is aimed, has been treated as the statute upon which the indictment is founded within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act. United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 95\n, 43 S.Ct. 39, 40; United States v. Walter, \n263 \nU.S. 15, 16\n, 17 S., 44 S.Ct. 10, 11. See, also, United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370, 387\n, 29 S.Ct. 123. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n 2. Appellees contend that the court below construed the indictment and not the statute. United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 306\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 7 A.L.R. 443; United States v. Hastings, \n296 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 56 S.Ct. 218, 219. The argument is that a conspiracy to violate section 35 must involve a pecuniary fraud. United States v. Cohn, \n270 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 346 S., 46 S.Ct. 251, 252, 253. In that view appellees urge that the court below has simply ruled that there was no pecuniary loss under the facts alleged. But the District Court found no flaw in the indictment as a pleading. Nor does the court appear to have considered the question of pecuniary loss. The court rested its decision upon the point that the facts alleged in the indictment with respect to the identity of the producers of the hogs, or the sources from which the hogs originated, had ceased to be material because of the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. This did not purport to be a construction of the indictment but a ruling that the indictment in view of the invalidity of that act failed to state an offense. The substance of the decision thus appears to be that the false claims statute does not apply to an attempt to defraud the United States by obtaining the approval of claims and benefit payments through false representations, if the statute providing for such claims and payments is found to be invalid. That is clearly a construction of the statute. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 325; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 230\n, 34 S.Ct. 512.\n\n 3. \nSuch a construction is inadmissible. It might as well be said that one could embezzle moneys in the United States Treasury with impunity if it turns out that they were collected in the course of invalid transactions. See Madden v. United States (C.C.A.) 80 F.2d 672, 674. Appellees were not indicted for a conspiracy to violate the Agricultural Adjustment Act but for a conspiracy to violate the statute protecting the United States against \n\n[302 \nU.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n frauds. It is cheating the government at which the statute aims and Congress was entitled to protect the government against those who would swindle it regardless of questions of constitutional authority as to the operations that the government is conducting. Such questions cannot be raised by those who make false claims against the government. See Langer v. United States (C.C.A.) 76 F.2d 817, 824, 825; Madden v. United States, supra; United States v. Harding, 65 App.D.C. 161, 81 F.2d 563, 568; United States v.

Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 403]\n\u00a0\n Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. David A. Reed, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee American Sheet and Tin Plate Co.\n Mr. John S. Burchmore, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Allegheny Steel Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from decrees of a specially constituted District Court1 of three judges enjoining and setting aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 404]\n\u00a0\n which required certain carriers to cease and desist from spotting cars on industrial plant tracks as part of the service rendered under interstate line-haul rates and from granting allowances out o the line-haul rates to industries doing such spotting. The appellees are five industrial concerns affected by the orders. They contend that the spotting service in question is transportation within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U. S.C.A.  1 et seq.); that the performance of the service, or the payment of an allowance to an industry which itself performs it, is sanctioned by custom and practice and by previous adjudications of the Commission; and that line-haul rates were fixed in contemplation of the rendition of such service. They further charge the orders are void because not supported by the Commission's findings or the evidence.\n Upon its own motion the Commission instituted an investigation known as Ex parte No. 104, Practices of Carriers affecting Operating Revenues or Expenses. Part II of that proceeding had to do with terminal services. \n2\n Voluminous evidence was adduced largely consisting of testimony by operating officials of carriers and traffic representatives of shippers touching the service of spotting cars at points upon the systems of plant trackage maintained by large industries. The Commission's report summarized its conclusions based on the evidence as to conditions at approximately two hundred industrial plants where spotting allowance were paid by the carriers and numerous plants where such services were performed by the carrier. The Commission found that line-haul rates had not been fixed to compensate the carriers for the performance of the service in question and that the railroads, after fixing their rates, had assumed a burden not previously borne by them. It found that section 15(13) of the act (49 U.S.C.A.  15(13) permitting allowances by carriers to those performing a portion of the service of transportation had been made the instrument of abuse by the pay- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 405]\n\u00a0\n ment of unwarranted allowances and added: 'When a carrier is prevented at its ordinary operating convenience from reaching points of loading or unloading within a plant, without interruption or interference by the desires of an industry or the disabilities of its plant, such as the manner in which the industrial operations are conducted, the arrangement or condition of its tracks, weighing service, or similar circumstances , ... the service beyond the point of interruption or interference is in excess of that performed in simple switching or team-track delivery.' In conclusion, the report states that payment for or exemption of the cost of service performed beyond such points of interruption or interference is in violation of section 6 (49 U.S.C.A.  6), provides the means by which the industry enjoys a preferential service not accorded to shippers generally, dissipates the carrier's funds and revenues, is not in conformity with the efficient or economical management contemplated by the Interstate Commerce Act, and is not in the public interest. No orders were made upon the footing of the main report, but thereafter, Division 6 promulgated supplemental reports recapitulating the testimony touching particular plants and making findings with respct to each and the service rendered thereat. Upon the basis of these supplementary proceedings orders to cease and desist were entered. \n3\n The carriers thereupon gave notice of a revision of the applicable tariffs canceling allowances or withdrawing the spotting service. Each appellee filed a bill praying that the order affecting it be set aside and enforcement be restrained. The causes \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 406]\n\u00a0\n were consolidated for hearing and were disposed of upon a single record in one opinion. Separate decrees were entered in the respective causes granting the requested relief. The appellants took a single appeal from all the decrees. We hold the Commission's orders were lawful and should not have been set aside.\n First. The appellees urge that the orders are fatally defective because the Commission failed to make the necessary quasi judicial findings. They point out that the Commission held that an allowance furnished a means whereby an industry enjoyed a preferential service not accorded to shippers generally, and constituted a refund or remission of a portion of the rates for transportation in violation of section 6(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  6(7). They assert these conclusions are insufficient to support a cease and desist order because the Commission has not found, as it must to bottom an order on sections 2, 3(1), and 15(1) of the Act,4 that the pracitce was unreasonable, unjustly preferential, unduly discriminatory, or otherwise unlawful. Respecting section 6(7)5 they say that as, by that section and section 15(13),6 allowances to shippers who perform a part of the service of transportation are permissible if tariffs setting forth the nature and amount of the allowance are duly filed, as they were in the present instance, it cannot be an unlawful refund or rebate for the carriers to make the allowances which the tariffs specify. If the findings were limited to the practices specified in the sections mentioned the position of the appellees would no doubt be sound, but the Commission has, in each case, found that the interchange tracks of the respective industries are reasonably convenient points for the receipt and delivery of interstate shipments and that the industry performs no service beyond those points of interchange \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 407]\n\u00a0\n for with the carrier is compensated under its interstate line-haul rates. These findings are an adjudication by the Commission that the spotting service within the appellees' plants is not transportation service which the carriers are bound to render in respect of receipt and delivery of freight. The statute contains this definition: 'The term 'transportation' ... shall include ... all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit ... of property transported.' 7 The Interstate Commerce Commission is authorized and required to enforce the provisions of the act8 and, after hearing, if it be of opinion that any regulation or practice of a carrier be unjust or unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory, 'or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of this act (chapter),' to determine what practice is or will be just, fair and reasonable to be thereafter followed and to make an order that the carrier cease and desist from violation to the extent that the Commission finds violation does or will exist. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The Commission, so it is said, has approved allowances in instances such as those under review and by a long course of decision has sanctioned the practice; and the claim is that the carriers have relied upon the Commission's action in doing plant spotting or making allowance for the performance of that service by industries. We cannot agree either that the Commission has so decided or that, if it had, it would be concluded from re-examining the question in the light of existing conditions. The Commission has repeatedly dealt with the matter. \n10\n In numerous instances, upon application of \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 408]\n\u00a0\n an industry for the performance of spotting service on its plant track system, or for an allowance from the carrier for itself performing the service, the Commission, in the view that like service was performed or an allowance paid for it at other similar plants, has ordered the removal of discrimination as between shippers. On the other hand, in some cases the Commission has held that the service demanded was not a service of transportation and has refused to order the carrier to perform it. \n11\n But, whatever may have been decided in the past, it is evident that the growth of the practice of making allowances for plant switching and the lack of uniformity in the practice of the carriers with respect to this service properly called for an investigation of the entire situation and the promulgation of appropriate orders to regulate the practice and prevent performance of a service not within the carrier's transportation obligation. The investigation and the consequent orders of the Commission were not foreclosed by its earlier decisions. The Commission is clearly empowered to determine what is embraced within the service of transportation and what lies outside that service. \n12\n Since the Commission finds that the carriers' service of transportation is complete upon delivery to the industries' interchange tracks, and that spotting within the plants is not included in the service for which the line-haul rates were fixed, there is power to enjoin the performance of that additional service or the making of an allowance to the industry which performs it. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 409]\n\u00a0\n Third. What has been said makes it unnecessary further to discuss the question of the adequacy of the Commission's findings. If supported, they are sufficient to sustain the orders made.\n Fourth. The cases were heard by the District Court on the record made before the Commission. The appellees challenge the orders as without support in the evidence. Examination of the record discloses that there is substantial evidence to sustain the Commission's findings.\n It is conceded that the line-haul rate covers delivery. Such rates are usually made to or from an area, sometimes designated a 'switching district' or 'switching limits.' Within that area the carrier holds itself out as agreeing to deliver freight in its freight depot or at team tracks or on sidings or spur-tracks owned by an industry. The practice has come to be uniform that in delivering a car on a team track the carrier will spot the car at a point where merchandise of the class contained in the car is usually and most conveniently unloaded; thus there are particular team tracks or points where fruit and vegetables, furniture, etc., etc., are constantly loaded and unloaded and cars are spotted accordingly. In the analogous situation where an industry's warehouses or other facilities are located at given points on a spur or side-track, the carrier holds itself out to spot the car at the point where it is needed for loading or unloading, as a warehouse door, a scrap pile, etc., etc.\n In the case of a large industry having many points of loading and unloading throughout its plant, the usual arrangement is to have lead tracks or interchange tracks on which the cars are, in the first instance, shifted; thence they are taken over plant tracks to various buildings and points and are spotted in accordance with the needs and convenience of the industry. It is asserted by the appellees that it has become customary to do this spotting \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 410]\n\u00a0\n on plant tracks as part of the delivery service which the carrier holds itself out as agreeing to perform without a charge additional to the line- haul rate. The record fails to establish any such custom. Carriers in official territory have, for perhaps thirty years, made allowances to certain industries for doing spotting within their plants. No uniform rule as to when such an allowance would be made has been adopted although there have been efforts to agree upon a rule. Apparently the plants most favored have been steel plants and some carriers have refused to extend the system of allowances to other than steel plants. It appears from the record that the making of allowances has not been governed by any principle and the case fall into three general classes: (1) Where the plant does its own spotting and receives an allowance; (2) where the railroad does plant spotting; (3) where the industry does its own spotting and receives no allowance.\n No allowances have been granted in New England territory, in the Southeast, or in the extreme Southwest. The practice of granting allowances has spread, to some extent, from official territory across the Mississippi and to the Northwest but here again there is no uniform rule about the matter. There is no custom or practice which has the force of a rule of law that the line-haul rate includes plant spotting service.\n The testimony of operating officials of the carriers and transportation officers of industries was not entirely consistent. Some took the position that it is the obligation of a carrier to spot a car on plant tracks if the spotting involves but a single uninterrupted movement which can be made at the carrier's convenience. Many took a broader view and indicated that in consideration of the large amount of traffic emanating from and terminating at a given plant the spotting of cars, in co-operation with the needs of the plant, would not involve a burden greater than the delivery of similar cars on team tracks. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 411]\n\u00a0\n There was much opinion evidence to the effect that the cost of spotting a car on plant tracks is no greater than that of placing a car on team tracks. There was, however, opinion evidence to the contrary, and facts were developed with respect to the amount of engine time involved in some of the operations under examination from which it may fairly be deduced that the industry switching involved greater expense than team track switching.\n The Commission properly held that each case must be decided upon the circumstances disclosed. It accordingly examined the evidence respecting the operations at the plant of each of the appellees and made its findings with respect to each upon the evidence in the record. We find it unnecessary to detail that evidence since it is summarized in the Commission's reports. It is sufficient now to say that in every case the Commission found, upon sufficient evidence, that the cars were, in the first instance, placed upon lead tracks, interchange tracks or sidings and subsequently spotted from these tracks; in each instance the spotting service involved one or more operations in addition to the placing of the car on interchange tracks, such as moving it to plant scales for weighing, or some additional burden, such as conformance to the convenience of the plant, supply of special motive power required by the plant's layout or trackage or some other element which called for excessive service greater than that involved in team track spotting or spotting on an ordinary industrial siding or spur. We are unable to say that the findings in respect of the individual plants lacked support in the evidence. We are, therefore, bound to accept them and to hold the orders lawful.\n The decrees will be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER is of opinion that the commission's ruling that the carriers' service of transportation is \n\n[301 \nU.S. 402, 412]\n\u00a0\n complete upon delivery to the industries' interchange tracks is not supported by the circumstantial facts found or by the evidence; that the orders here involved are based upon a misconstruction of the Act, and that the decrees of the district court should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 58 S.Ct. 3, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 15 F.Supp. 711. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 209 I.C.C. 11. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The reports and orders affecting the appellees are the following: American Sheet & Tin Plate Company Terminal Allowance, 209 I.C.C. 719; Allegheny Steel Company Terminal Allowance, 209 I.C.C. 273; Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company Terminal Allowance, 209 I.C.C. 467; Weirton Steel Company Terminal Allowance, 209 I.C.C. 445; West Leechburg Steel Company Terminal Allowance, 210 I.C.C. 213; Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company Terminal Allowance, 210 I.C.C. 527. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 49 U.S.C.  2, 3(1), 15(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  2, 3(1), 15(1). \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 49 U.S.C.  6(7), 49 U.S.C.A.  6(7). \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 49 U.S.C.  15(13), 49 U.S.C.A.  15(13). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  1, 34 Stat. 584, as amended, 49 U.

BELMONT(1937)\nNo. 532\nArgued: March 4, 1937Decided: May 3, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 325]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Stanley Reed, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. C. W. Wickersham, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action at law brought by petitioner against respondents in a federal District Court to recover a sum of money deposited by a Russian corporation (Petrograd \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 326]\n\u00a0\n Metal Works) with August Belmont, a private banker doing business in New York City under the name of August Belmont & Co. August Belmont died in 1924; and respondents are the duly appointed executors of his will. A motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action was sustained by the District Court, and its judgment was affirmed by the court below. (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 542. The facts alleged, so far as necessary to be stated, follow.\n The corporation had deposited with Belmont, prior to 1918, the sum of money which petitioner seeks to recover. In 1918, the Soviet government duly enacted a decree by which it dissolved, terminated, and liquidated the corporation (together with others), and nationalized and appropriated all of its property and assets of every kind and wherever situated, including the deposit account with Belmont. As a result, the deposit became the property of the Soviet government, and so remained until November 16, 1933, at which time the Soviet government released and assigned to petitioner all amounts due to that government from American nationals, including the deposit account of the corporation with Belmont. Respondents failed and refused to pay the amount upon demand duly made by petitioner.\n The assignment was effected by an exchange of diplomatic correspondence between the Soviet government and the United States. The purpose was to bring about a final settlement of the claims and counterclaims between the Soviet government and the United States; and it was agreed that the Soviet government would take no steps to enforce claims against American nationals; but all such claims were released and assigned to the United States, with the understanding that the Soviet government was to be duly notified of all amounts realized by the United States from such release and assignment. The assignment and requirement for notice \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 327]\n\u00a0\n are parts of the larger plan to bring about a settlement of the rival claims of the high contracting parties. The continuing and definite interest of the Soviet government in the collection of assigned claims is evident; and the case, therefore, presents a question of public concern, the determination of which well might involve the good faith of the United States in the eyes of a foreign government. The court below held that the assignment thus effected embraced the claim here in question; and with that we agree.\n That court, however, took the view that the situs of the bank deposit was within the state of New York; that in no sense could it be regarded as an intangible property right within Soviet territory; and that the nationalization decree, if enforced, would put into effect an act of confiscation. And it held that a judgment for the United States could not be had, because, in view of that result, it would be contrary to the controlling public policy of the state of New York. The further contention is made by respondents that the public policy of the United States would likewise be infringed by such a judgment. The two questions thus presented are the only ones necessary to be considered.\n First. We do not pause to inquire whether in fact there was any policy of the state of New York to be infringed, since we are of opinion that no state policy can prevail against the international compact here involved.\n This court has held, Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250\n, 18 S.Ct. 83, that every sovereign state must recognize the independence of every other sovereign state; and that the courts of one will not sit in judgment upon the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory.\n That general principle was applied in Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 309, to a case where an action in replevin had been brought in a New Jersey state court to recover a consignment of hides purchased in Mexico from \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 328]\n\u00a0\n General Villa. The title of the purchaser was assailed on the ground that Villa had confiscated the hides. Villa, it appeared, had seized the hides while conducting independent operations under the Carranza government, which at the time of the seizure had made much progress in its revolution in Mexico. The government of the United States, after the trial of the case in the state court, had recognized the government of Carranza, first as the de facto government of the Republic of Mexico, and later as the government de jure. This court held that the conduct of foreign relations was committed by the Constitution to the political departments of the government, and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power was not subject to judicial inquiry or decision; that who is the sovereign of a territory is not a judicial question, but one the determination of which by the political departments conclusively binds the courts; and that recognition by these departments is retroactive and validates all actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence. 'The principle,' we said, \n246 \nU.S. 297\n, at page 303, 38 S.Ct. 309, 311, 'that the conduct of one independent government cannot be successfully questioned in the courts of another is as applicable to a case involving the title to property brought within the custody of a court, such as we have here, as it was held to be to the cases cited, in which claims for damages were based upon acts done in a foreign country, for it rests at last upon the highest considerations of international comity and expediency. To permit the validity of the acts of one sovereign state to be reexamined and perhaps condemned by the courts of another would very certainly 'imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.\" Ricaud v. American Metal Co., \n246 \nU.S. 304, 308\n, 309 S., 310, 38 S.Ct. 312, is to the same effect.\n In A. M. Luther v. James Sagor & Co., L.R.(1921) 3 K.B. 532, the English Court of Appeal expressly ap- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 329]\n\u00a0\n proved and followed our decision in the Oetjen Case. The English case involved that part of the same decree of the Soviet government here under consideration which declared certain private woodworking establishments to be the property of the Republic. Under that decree the government seized plaintiff's factory in Russia together with a stock of wood therein. Agents of the Republic sold a quantity of the stock so seized to the defendants, who imported it into England. Thereafter, the British government recognized the Soviet government as the de facto government of Russia. Upon these facts, the court held that, the British government having thus recognized the Soviet government, existing at a date before the decree in question, the validity of that decree and the sale of the wood to the defendants could not be impugned, and gave judgment for defendants accordingly. The court regarded the decree as one of confiscation, but was unable to see (Bankes, L.J., p. 546) how the courts could treat the decree 'otherwise than as the expression by the de facto government of a civilized country of a policy which it considered to be in the best interest of that country. It must be quite immaterial for present purposes that the same views are not entertained by the Government of this country, are repudiated by the vast majority of its citizens, and are not recognized by our laws.' Lord Justice Scrutton, in his opinion, discusses ( pp. 557-559) the contention that the courts should refuse to recognize the decree and the titles derived under it as confiscatory and unjust, and concludes that the question is one not for the judges but for the action of the sovereign through his ministers. 'I do not feel able,' he said, 'to come to the conclusion that the legislation of a state recognized by my Sovereign as an independent sovereign state is so contrary to moral principle that the judges ought not to recognize it. The responsibility for recognition or non-recognition with the consequences of each rests on the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 330]\n\u00a0\n political advisers of the Sovereign and not on the judges.' Further citation of authority seems unnecessary.\n We take judicial notice of the fact that coincident with the assignment set forth in the complaint, the President recognized the Soviet government, and normal diplomatic relations were established between that government and the government of the United States, followed by an exchange of ambassadors. The effect of this was to validate, so far as this country is concerned, all acts of the Soviet government here involved from the commencement of its existence. The recognition, establishment of diplomatic relations, the assignment, and agreements with respect thereto, were all parts of one transaction, resulting in an international compact between the two governments. That the negotiations, acceptance of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over internal affairs is distributed between the national government and the several states. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, as in the case of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2,  2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.\n A treaty signifies 'a compact made between two or more independent nations, with a view to the public welfare.' B. Altman & Co. v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 583, 600\n, 32 S.Ct. 593, 596. But an international compact, as this was, is not always a treaty which requires the participation of the Senate. There are many such compacts, of which a protocol, a modus vivendi, a postal convention, and agree- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 331]\n\u00a0\n ments like that now under consideration are illustrations. See 5 Moore, Int.Law Digest, 210-221. The distinction was pointed out by this court in the Altman Case, supra, which arose under section 3 of the Tariff Act of 1897 (30 Stat. 151, 203), authorizing the President to conclude commercial agreements with foreign countries in certain specified matters. We held that although this might not be a treaty requiring ratification by the Senate, it was a compact negotiated and proclaimed under the authority of the President, and as such was a 'treaty' within the meaning of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act (26 Stat. 826), the construction of which might be reviewed upon direct appeal to this court.\n Plainly, the external powers of the United States are to be exercised without regard to state laws or policies. The supremacy of a treaty in this respect has been recognized from the beginning. Mr. Madison, in the Virginia Convention, said that if a treaty does not supersede existing state laws, as far as they contravene its operation, the treaty would be ineffective. 'To counteract it by the supremacy of the state laws, would bring on the Union the just charge of national perfidy, and involve us in war.' 3 Elliot's Debates 515. And see Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 236, 237. And while this rule in respect of treaties is established by the express language of clause 2, article 6, of the Constitution, the same rule would result in the case of all international compacts and agreements from the very fact that complete power over international affairs is in the national government and is not and cannot be subject to any curtailment or interference on the part of the several states. Compare United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 304\n, 316 et seq., 57 S.Ct. 216, 219. In respect of all international negotiations and compacts, and in respect of our foreign relations generally, state lines disappear. As to such purposes the state of New York does not exist. Within the field of its powers, what \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 332]\n\u00a0\n ever the United States right-fully undertakes, it necessarily has warrant to consummate. And when judicial authority is invoked in aid of such consummation, State Constitutions, state laws, and state policies are irrelevant to the inquiry and decision. It is inconceivable that any of them can be interposed as an obstacle to the effective operation of a federal constitutional power. Cf. Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416\n, 40 S. Ct. 382, 11 A.L.R. 984; Asakura v. Seattle, \n265 \nU.S. 332, 341\n, 44 S.Ct. 515, 516\n\n\n Second. The public policy of the United States relied upon as a bar to the action is that declared by the Constitution, namely, that private property shall not be taken without just compensation. But the answer is that our Constitution, laws, and policies have no extraterritorial operation, unless in respect of our own citizens. Compare United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, supra, \n299 \nU.S. 304\n, at page 318, 57 S. Ct. 216, 220. What another country has done in the way of taking over property of its nationals, and especially of its corporations, is not a matter for judicial consideration here. Such nationals must look to their own government for any redress to which they may be entitled. So far as the record shows, only the rights of the Russian corporation have been affected by what has been done; and it will be time enough to consider the rights of our nationals when, if ever, by proper judicial proceeding, it shall be made to appear that they are so affected as to entitle them to judicial relief. The substantive right to the moneys, as now disclosed, became vested in the Soviet government as the successor to the corporation; and this right that government has passed to the United States. It does not appear that respondents have any interest in the matter beyond that of a custodian. Thus far no question under the Fifth Amendment is involved.\n It results that the complaint states a cause of action and that the judgment of the court below to the contrary is erroneous. In so holding, we deal only with the case \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 333]\n\u00a0\n as now presented and with the parties now before us. We do not consider the status of adverse claims, if there be any, of others not parties to this action. And nothing we have said is to be construed as foreclosing the assertion of any such claim to the fund involved, by intervention or other appropriate proceeding. We decide only that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the respondents.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I agree with the result, but I am unable to follow the path by which it is reached. Upon the record before us there is, I think, no question of re-examining the validity of acts of a foreign state, and no question of the United States' declaring and enforcing a policy inconsistent with one that the state of New York might otherwise adopt in conformity to its own laws and the Constitution.\n The United States, by agreement with the Soviet government, has acquired an assignment of all the rights of the latter in a chose in action, against an American citizen, formerly belonging to a Russian national, and confiscated by decree of the Soviet government. If the subject of the transfer were a chattel belonging to an American, but located in Russia, we may assume that the validity of the seizure would be recognized here. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 309; Ricaud v. American Metal Co., 246 U.S., 304, 308-310, 38 S. Ct. 312; Salimoff & Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 262 N.Y. 220, 186 N.E. 679, 89 A.L.R. 345. Similarly, the confiscation of the present claim, being lawful where made, is upon familiar principles to be regarded as effective in New York, except in so far as that state, by reason of the presence of the debtor there, may adopt and enforce a policy based upon nonrecognition of the transfer. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 334]\n\u00a0\n But this Court has often recognized that a state may refuse to give effect to a transfer, made elsewhere, of property which is within its own territorial limits, if the transfer is in conflict with its public policy.

It is likewise free to disregard the transfer where the subject of it is a chose in action due from a debtor within the state to a foreign creditor, especially where, as in the present case, the debtor's only obligation is to pay within the state, on demand.

Payment of the debt to the United States as transferee will discharge the debtor and impose on him no burden which he did not undertake when he assumed the position of debtor. Beyond this he has no interest for the state \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 335]\n\u00a0\n to protect. But it is a recognized rule that a state may rightly refuse to give effect to external transfers of property within its borders so far as they would operate to exclude creditors suing in its courts. Harrison v. Sterry, supra; Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, supra; The Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra; Clark v. Williard, supra; Barth v. Backus, supra.\n We recently held, in Clark v. Williard, supra, that the full faith and credit clause does not preclude the attachment of property within the state, by a local creditor of a foreign corporation, all of whose property has been previously transferred, in the state of its incorporation, to a statutory successor for the benefit of creditors. Due process under the Fifth Amendment, the benefits of which extend to alien friends, as well as to citizens, Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481\n, 51 S. Ct. 229, does not require any different result. The Disconto Gesell-Schaft v. Umbreit, supra, \n208 \nU.S. 570, 579\n, 580 S., 28 S.Ct. 337. The Constitution has no different application where the property transferred is a chose in action, later seized by a creditor in the state of the debtor. The Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra. See Harrison v. Sterry, supra. In conformity to this doctrine, New York would have been free to enforce a local policy, subordinating the .soviet government, as the successor of its national, to local suitors. Its judicial decisions indicate that such may be its policy for the protection of creditors or others claiming an interest in the sum due. James & Co. v. Second Russian Insurance Co., 239 N.Y. 248, 257, 146 N.E. 369, 37 A.L.R. 720; Matter of People (City Equity Fire Insurance Co.), 238 N.Y. 147, 152, 144 N.E. 484; Matter of Waite, 99 N.Y. 433, 448, 2 N.E. 440. See Vladikavkazsky Ry. Co. v. New York Trust Co., supra.\n It seems plain that, so far as now appears, the United States does not stand in any better position with respect to the assigned claim than did its assignor, or any other \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 336]\n\u00a0\n transferee of the Soviet government. We may, for present purposes, assume that the United States, by treaty with a foreign government with respect to a subject in which the foreign government has some interest or concern, could alter the policy which a state might otherwise adopt. It is unnecessary to consider whether the present agreement between the two governments can rightly be given the same effect as a treaty within this rule, for neither the allegations of the bill of complaint, nor the diplomatic exchanges, suggest that the United States has either recognized or declared that any state policy is to be overridden.\n So far as now relevant, the document signed by the Soviet government, as preparatory to a more general settlement of claims and counterclaims between the two governments, assigns and releases to the United States all amounts 'due or that may be found to be due it' from American nationals, and provides that the Soviet government is 'to be duly notified in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from such release and assignment.' The relevant portion of the document signed by the President is expressed in the following paragraph:\n'I am glad to have these undertakings by your Government and I shall be pleased to notify your Government in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from the release and assignment to it of the amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due.'\n\n There is nothing in either document to suggest that the United States was to acquire or exert any greater rights than its transferor, or that the President, by mere executive action, purported or intended to alter the laws and policy of any state in which the debtor of an assigned claim might reside, or that the United States, as assignee, \n\n[301 \nU.S. 324, 337]\n\u00a0\n is to do more than the Soviet government could have done after diplomatic recognition-that is, collect the claims in conformity with those laws. Cf. Todok v. Union State Bank, \n281 \nU.S. 449\n, 50 S.Ct. 363.\n As respondent debtor may not challenge the effect of the assignment to the United States, the judgment is rightly reversed. But as the reversal is without prejudice to the rights of any other parties to intervene, they should be left free to assert, by intervention or other appropriate procedure, such claims with respect to the amount due as are in accordance with the laws and policy of New York. There is no occasion to say anything now which can be taken to foreclose the assertion by such claimants of their rights under New York law.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. HELVERING(1937)\nNo. 285\nArgued: April 29, 1937Decided: May 24, 1937\n\n\n\n Mr. H. Cecil Kilpatrick, of Washington, D.C., and Mr. Charles Myers, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Paul Jackson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are asked to determine whether mandamus is the proper remedy to compel the Commissioner \n\n[301 \nU.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n of Internal Revenue to refund taxes, paid by a testamentary trustee on income of the trust, when the amount refunded would inure to the benefit of the cestui que trust, who should have paid the tax, now barred by the statute of limitations.\n The testator by his will created a trust to pay over net income to his widow during her life. She elected to take under the will in lieu of the interest otherwise allowed by Pennsylvania law. The refund demanded is for taxes assessed against petitioner, the trustee, and paid by it upon the net income paid over to the beneficiary for the years 1924 to 1926, inclusive, and for the year 1928\n\n\n As a result of deficiency proceedings the Board of Tax Appeals has entered final orders determining that the amounts paid by the trustee as taxes for those years are overpayments. The beneficiary paid taxes on the income paid over to her by the trustee for the years 1924 to 1927, inclusive, but these were afterward refunded to her in recognition of the rule then followed by several courts of appeals that in these circumstances the income payments to the widow are annuities purchased by her surrender of her dower interest which are not taxable as income to her, until they equal the value of the dower interest. Warner v. Walsh (C.C.A.) 15 F.(2d) 367; United States v. Bolster (C.C.A.) 26 F.(2d) 760, 59 A.L.R. 491; Allen v. Brandeis (C.C.A.) 29 F.(2d) 363. See Stone v. White, \n301 \nU.S. 532\n, 57 S.Ct. 851, 81 L.Ed. --, decided this day. She paid no tax on the income for the year 1928.\n By our decision in Helvering v. Butterworth, worth, \n290 \nU.S. 365\n, 54 S.Ct. 221, it was established that the income paid over to the widow is taxable to her and not to the trustee, and in consequence that the tax, which in this case should have been paid by the beneficiary, had been erroneously collected from the trustee. It appears that the total amount of the taxes which the beneficiary should have paid exceeds the amount of the refund demanded of the Commissioner, and that the refund, if allowed, will become a part of the income of the beneficiary. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n The present petition for mandamus to compel respondent, the Commission of Internal Revenue, to refund to petitioner the taxes erroneously collected, was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the District. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the petitioner was not equitably entitled to the refund which, if allowed, would inure to the benefit of the widow, whose liability for the tax is barred by the statute of limitations. 66 App.D.C. 64, 85 F.(2d) 230. We granted certiorari, \n300 \nU.S. 643\n, 57 S.Ct. 610, 81 L.Ed. --, the questions decided by the Court of Appeals being cognate to those considered in Stone v. White, supra.\n The government, while supporting the decision of the court below on the merits, insists that the case is not a proper one for the use of the extraordinary writ of mandamus, and that the suit should have been dismissed on that ground. The petition for mandamus is predicated upon the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals that petitioner has made overpayments of taxes for the specified years. The Board has not ordered a refund. It could not rightly do so, for its jurisdiction is limited to the determination of the amount of deficiency or overpayment, Revenue Act of 1928,  272, 322(d), (26 U.S.C.A.  272, 322(d) and notes, and section 507, (45 Stat. p. 871) upon the petition of the taxpayer to review a deficiency assessment by the Commissioner. The Board is without authority to order a refund or a credit, although its decision is res adjudicata as to the questions involved in the computation and assessment of taxes for which a deficiency is claimed. Cf. Old Colony Trust Company v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 726\n, 727 S., 49 S.Ct. 499, 502, 503. When the determination of overpayment by the Board becomes final, the statute provides that such amounts shall be refunded or credited, section 322(d), 26 U.S.C.A.  322(d) and note and upon the Commissioner's failure to comply with the statute, a plenary suit will lie in the District Court or the Court of Claims, for the recovery of any refund to which he is entitled. See National Fire Insurance Co. v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 52 F.( 2d) 1011, 1013, 1014; James v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 38 F.(2d) 140, 143; Ohio Steel Foundry Co. v. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n United States (Ct.Cl.) 38 F.(2d) 144, 148, 149. And in such a suit the Commissioner may secure a final adjudication of his right to withhold the overpayment determined by the Board, on the ground that other taxes are due from the taxpayer, or that upon other grounds he is not equitably entitled to the refund. See Stone v. White, supra; Welch v. Obispo Oil Co., \n301 \nU.S. 532\n, 57 S.Ct. 684, 81 L.Ed. --, decided April 26, 1937; Lewis v. Reynolds, \n284 \nU.S. 281\n, 52 S.Ct. 145; Crocker v. Malley, \n249 \nU.S. 223, 225\n, 39 S.Ct. 270, 2 A.L.R. 1601.\n In view of what we have just decided in Stone v. White, supra, it is evident that in the circumstances of this case there is no clear duty of the Commissioner to refund the tax without securing a final adjudication of the government's right to retain it, as he may do by interposing an appropriate defense in a suit for the refund. Where the right of the petitioner is not clear, and the duty of the officer, performance of which is to be commanded, is not plainly defined and peremptory, mandamus is not an appropriate remedy. United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 50, 61\n, 55 S.Ct. 326, 330; United States ex rel. Barton v. Wilbur, \n283 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 420 S., 51 S.Ct. 502, 504; Wilbur v.

The officer must be left free, in the performance of official duty, to decide whether he will perform the act demanded or secure by appropriate procedure a judicial determination of the extent of his duty. His decision 'is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion,' the exercise of which will not be compelled by mandamus, Wilbur v. United States, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 206, 219\n, 50 S.Ct. 320, 324. Hall v. Payne, \n254 \nU.S. 343, 347\n, 41 S.Ct. 131; United States ex rel. Riverside Oil Co. v.

Co., supra.\n It is true that the right to a writ of mandamus may turn on equitable considerations, as the court below held. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352\n, 53 S.Ct. 614. But to try petitioner's equitable right to the refund here is to make the writ of mandamus serve the purpose of an ordinary suit and to depart from the settled rule that the writ of mandamus may not be employed to secure the adjudication of a disputed right for which an ordinary suit affords a remedy equally adequate, and complete. See Ex parte Baldwin, \n291 \nU.S. 610, 619\n, 54 S.Ct. 551, 555; Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, 292; United States v. Duell, \n172 \nU.S. 576, 582\n, 19 S.Ct. 286.\n As we conclude that the issue is not one which should be adjudicated in a proceeding for mandamus it is unnecessary to consider the merits and the judgment will be affirmed without prejudice to any other appropriate proceeding for the refund of the tax.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. HUDSON(1937)\nNo. 97\nArgued: Decided: January 11, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert H.\nJackson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States. \n\n[299 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bernhard Knollenberg, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent bought on May 3, and sold on May 23 and 29, all in 1934, certain futures contracts for the delivery of 500,000 ounces of silver, and realized therefrom, after deducting allowed expenses, a profit of $8, 621.96. He paid a tax of 50 per cent. of this profit in obedience to the taxing provision of the Silver Purchase Act of June 19, 1934,1 duly but unsuccessfully sought to have the amount of the tax refunded, and then brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the same. The court held the tax invalid, as retroactively applied to respondent's sales, and gave judgment accordingly. 12 F.Supp. 620; 13 F.Supp. 640. The case is here on certiorari.\n The Silver Purchase Act, in section 8, imposes on all transfers of any interest in silver bullion, where the price for which such interest is transferred exceeds the total cost and allowed expenses, a tax of 50 per centum of such excess, and requires that the tax be paid by affixing to a memorandum of the sale lawful stamps in the amount of the tax. The section further provides that the tax, besides reaching transfers thereafter made, shall be applicable to transfers made on or after May act, with the qualification that as to such act, with the qualification that \n\n[299 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n as to such prior transfers the tax shall be paid in such manner and at such time as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation prescribe.\n The question presented for decision is whether, in view of the restraints of the due process of law clause of the Constitution,2 the retroactive provision under which the tax was exacted from the respondent is an admissible exertion of the power to tax.\n Examination of the taxing provision and of pertinent decisions shows, as we think, that the answer must be in the affirmative.\n The taxing provision does not impose a tax in respect of all transfers, but only in respect of such as yield a profit over cost and allowed expenses. If there be no profit, there is to be no tax. If there be a profit, the tax is to be 50 per cent. of it. Thus a profit is made the occasion for the tax and also the measure of it. Because of this, counsel for the government contend that the tax is a special income tax; and we think the contention is sound.\n It is not material that such profit is taxed, along with other gains, under the general income tax law, for Congress has power to impose an increased or additional tax if satisfied there is need therefor. Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n, 620-622, 22 S.Ct. 493.\n As respects income tax statutes, it long has been the practice of Congress to make them retroactive for relatively short periods so as to include profits from transactions consummated while the statute was in process of enactment, or within so much of the calendar year as preceded the enactment; and repeated decisions of this Court have recognized this practice and sustained it as consistent with the due process of law clause of the Constitution. Stockdale v. Insurance Company, 20 Wall. 323, 331, \n\n[299 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n 332, 341; Brushaber v. Union Pracific R.

The cases on which the Court of Claims partly rested its decision were both examined and distinguished in Cooper v. United States and Milliken v. United States.\n The period of retroactivity prescribed for this taxing provising reaches backward from June 19, 1934, the date of the act, to and including May 15, 1934-35 days. For some months prior to this period there was strong pressure for legislation requiring increased acquisition and use of silver by the government, and several bills providing therefor were presented in the Senate and House of Representatives. On May 22 the President sent to Congress a message3 recommending legislation for increasing the amount of silver in our monetary stocks and further recommending the imposition of a tax of at least 50 per cent. on profits accruing from private dealing in silver. The bill which became the Silver Purchase Act was introduced May 23 in response to this message. In these circumstances we think the period of retroactivity fixed in the act is not unreasonable, but consistent with the practice sustained by this Court in the cases already cited.\n It results that the Court of Claims erred in holding the retroactive provision invalid as applied to respondent's sales.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 674,  8, 48 Stat. 1178 (26 U.S.C.A.  904a). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Fifth Amendment contains the due process of law clause applicable to the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Hearings on H.R. 9745, Silver Purchase Act of 1934, pp. 1 and 2. \n\n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES V.

Bentley, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Respondent brought this suit in the District Court for Southern California to recover total permanent disability benefits under a contract of war risk term insurance. While in the military service of the United States in the World War, he acquired a term policy of war risk insurance. On November 1, 1919, availing himself of the benefits of section 404 of the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 398, 410, he converted his term insurance into a twenty-payment life policy of United States government insurance. He paid premiums on this policy until January 31, 1920, when it was allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premiums. On the date of the conversion of his first policy, he was suffering from a 'compensable disability,' and, after the lapse of the second, on June 6, 1925, he was rated by the Veterans' Bureau as totally and permanently disabled. At that time he was entitled to disability compensation from the government in the sum of $312.25.\n  On the trial in the District Court a jury was waived and the case was heard on an agreed statement of facts. The court gave judgment for the respondent for permanent disability benefits under his first policy, with respect to so much of the insurance as the $312.25 of disability compensation, remaining uncollected at the time of total permanent disability, would have purchased if applied to the payment of premiums due upon the original policy between the date of its conversion and the date of total disability. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 85 F.(2d) 609, holding that respondent was en- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 500\n, 502]\n\u00a0\n titled, under sections 305, 307 of the World War Veterans' Act (38 \nU.S.C.A .  516, 518), to revive the original term insurance and to recover under it the permanent disability benefits awarded by the trial court. We granted certiorari, \n299 \nU.S. 538\n, because of the importance of the decision of the Court of Appeals, which conflicts with the consistent rulings of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, and affects, adversely to the government, a large number of pending insurance claims.\n  Section 305 of the World War Veterans' Act of June 7, 1924, c. 320, 43 Stat. 624, 626, as amended July 2, 1926, c. 723, 44 Stat. 790, 799, 38 \nU.S.C.  516 (38 \nU.S.C.A.  516), applies to lapsed, canceled, or reduced insurance policies. It provides:\n'Where any person has heretofore (prior to June 7, 1924), allowed his insurance to lapse, or has canceled or reduced all or any part of such insurance, while suffering from a compensable disability for which compensation was not collected and dies or has died, or becomes or has become permanently and totally disabled and at the time of such death or permanent total disability was or is entitled to compensation remaining uncollected, then and in that event so much of his insurance as said uncollected compensation, * * * would purchase if applied as premiums when due, shall not be considered as lapsed, canceled or reduced; and the United States Veterans' Bureau (Veterans' Administration) is hereby authorized and directed to pay to said soldier, or his beneficiaries, as the case may be, the amount of said insurance.'\n\n  Section 307, as amended July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 991, 1001, 38 \nU.S.C.  518 (38 \nU.S.C.A.  518), relates to all insurance policies 'heretofore or hereafter issued, reinstated, or converted.' It declares that all such policies shall be incontestable and provides:\n'That the insured under such contract or policy may, without prejudicing his rights, elect to make claim to the bureau (Veterans' Administration) or to bring suit under section 19 of this Act (section 445 of this title) on \n\n[300 \nU.S. 500\n, 503]\n\u00a0\n any prior contract or policy, and if found entitled thereto, shall, upon surrender of any subsequent contract or policy, be entitled to payments under the prior contract or policy.'\n\n  Respondent elected to claim under his original policy, presumably because the rate of premiums for the term insurance was lower than for the twenty-payment life policy, and the $312.25 of disability compensation would purchase a larger amount of the former type than of the latter. The government admits that the respondent is entitled, under section 305, to revive the twenty-payment life policy which has lapsed, but contends that he is not entitled to revive the earlier term insurance which he had converted, because section 305 omits any reference to converted insurance, such as appears in section 307.\n  All war risk policies were required to be for term insurance by section 404 of the War Risk Insurance Act, but that section permitted conversion of the insurance into other forms, after termination of the war. When Congress desired to legislate about one form of insurance thus changed into another, it explicitly used the descriptive term 'converted.' 1 The omission of any reference to converted insurance in section 305 indicates that the privilege of reviving a lapsed, canceled, or reduced policy, was not intended to extend to an earlier policy converted into another, whose lapse is the condition of the revival. Such must be taken to be the meaning if it is consistent with the purposes of the section, disclosed by its legislative history and with the provisions of other sections. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 500\n, 504]\n\u00a0\n  The legislative history supports the government's argument that from the beginning the aim of the legislation later embodied in section 305 was to permit the veteran to revive his policy when he had allowed it to lapse, for want of funds, at a time when there was money due him from the government for a compensable disability. The supposition was that he would have paid the premiums on the lapsed policy if he had then received the sum due from the government-a supposition which is inadmissible if, at that time, he had converted low premium term insurance into any of the other forms of insurance commanding a higher premium, as permitted by section 404.\n  In its original form, section 305 appeared as a part of section 408 of the War Risk Insurance Act, added by the Act of August 9, 1921,  27, c. 57, 42 Stat. 147, 156, 157. The bill which became section 408, as originally reported by the House Committee, provided for the reinstatement by disabled veterans of their lapsed and canceled policies. In recommending this legislation, the Committee of the House having it in charge pointed out that most such lapses and cancellations occurred at a time when disability compensation was due to the veteran, and were probably occasioned by lack of funds. \n2\n The bill was amended on the floor of the House3 so as to include the provisions later elaborated into section 305. They permitted the revival of a lapsed policy in favor of the beneficiaries of a deceased veteran, if, at the time of the lapse, he had been entitled to money from the government for a com- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 500\n, 505]\n\u00a0\n pensable disability. 4 The proviso, upon which revival was conditioned, that at the time of the lapse compensation be due from the government to the veteran, made more explicit the purpose indicated in the Committee Report. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n  As then adopted, the revival provision applied only to lapsed policies, but as amended by the Act of July 2, 1926 (44 Stat. 790), it was extended to include 'canceled or reduced' insurance. This amendment was adopted for the purpose of avoiding a ruling of the Comptroller General that the phrase 'lapsed insurance' did not embrace canceled or reduced insurance, even though the cancellation or reduction occurred at a time when compensation was owing to the veteran. See Report of House Committee, No. 1217, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7, 8; Hearings before Senate Finance Committee, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., on H.R. 12175, pp. 50, 51. Neither the words nor the legislative history of section 305 suggest that the phrase 'canceled or reduced insurance' was intended to include insurance elsewhere described in the act as 'converted,' at least unless the conversion was accompanied by a reduction of the policy. The like administrative construction which has consistently been given to the section by the Veterans' Bureau6 is of persuasive force. Norwegian \n\n[300 \nU.S. 500\n, 506]\n\u00a0\n Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n, 358; Brown v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 568, 571\n.\n  The other sections of the act are consistent with this construction of section 305. Section 307 permits the insured, if totally disabled, to make claim under his converted policy and entitles him to the benefits of that policy 'if found entitled thereto.' See United States v. Arzner, \n287 \nU.S. 470, 473\n, 239. But it is plain that respondent is not 'entitled' to total disability benefits under the original policy, within the meaning of section 307, because the total disability did not occur until after its conversion. Section 307 does not, either by its terms or by reasonable implication, extend the privileges of section 305 to converted insurance. The legislative history of section 307 does not disclose any purpose to amend section 305, or to depart from its policy, and in any case the modification by implication of the settled construction of an earlier and different section is not favored. United States v. Munday, \n222 \nU.S. 175, 182\n; Ibanez v. Hongkong Banking Corporation, \n246 \nU.S. 621, 626\n. The right of respondent to revive his insurance is limited to the lapsed twenty-payment life policy.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See World War Veterans' Act, 1924,  307, as amended July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 991, 1001, 38 \nU.S.C.  518 (38 U.S.C.A.  518).

Shuman, of North Platte, Neb., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The record in this case presents an important question of federal criminal law which has not been settled by our decisions. Does retraction neutralize false testimony previously given and exculpate the witness of perjury?1\n  April 10, 1930, the United States Senate, by resolution, empowered the Vice President to appoint a special committee to investigate campaign expenditures of candidates for the Senate, the committee to sit at such times and places as it should deem proper, to require attendance of witnesses and production of books and papers, and to act by any subcommittee. Failure to obey process of the committee or refusal to answer questions pertinent to the investigation was to be punished according to law. The \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 569]\n\u00a0\n resolution recited that the Senate desired facts to aid it in enacting remedial legislation and in deciding contests involving senatorial elections. \n2\n The committee so appointed authorized Senator Nye, the Chairman, to act as a subcommittee and to name a subcommittee of one or more members. Such a subcommittee, consisting of Senators Nye and Dale, met September 22, 1930, at Lincoln, Neb. The Nebraska primary election had been held on August 12, 1930; the general election at which the names of senatorial candidates were to appear on the ballots was to be held the following November. Senator George W. Norris of McCook, Neb., had filed for the Republican primaries on January 1, 1930, and W. M. Stebbins had, on November 12, 1929, filed his acceptance of Republican nominating petitions in his behalf. The respondent had attempted to file for the same primaries on July 5, 1930, but the Supreme Court of the state had ruled on July 18th that his application was not filed within the time prescribed by law and had ordered the Secretary of State to omit his name from the list of candidates for United States Senator to be certified to county clerks and election commissioners. 3 In the light of these facts the subcommittee summoned the respondent to testify on September 22, 1930. He was called and sworn to tell the truth and the whole truth. He narrated something of his personal history and said his original intention was to run for State Railway Commissioner, but he did not file for that office because he thought about filing for United States Senator. He gave the following testimony:\n'Q. Now what assurance did you have of financial support and backing? A. None whatever. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 570]\n\u00a0\n  'Q. In your campaign? A. None whatever. * * *\n\n'Q. Did you get any assurance from anybody that they would help you- Republican, Democrat, independents, or anybody say they would help to finance your campaign? A. No, sir. * * *\n\n'Q. Did you receive any money from anybody in the campaign? A. I did not.'\n\n  After the conclusion of his testimony the subcommittee adjourned until the following day, when several witnesses were examined, amongst whom was one Johnson. The respondent was present and heard Johnson testify. After consulting his counsel, he asked and was granted permission to return to the stand. He then admitted the receipt from Johnson of $50 to be used for his filing fee and a $500 government bond, and stated that he had cashed the bond through his brother at North Platte.\n  June 23, 1931, the grand jury for the District of Nebraska indicted the respondent for perjury under section 125 of the Criminal Code. \n4\n On his trial the government proved the facts as above outlined and called Johnson as a witness who testified that, pursuant to a plan devised by himself and others, he had approached the respondent on June 30th and requested him not to file as a candidate \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 571]\n\u00a0\n for Railway Commissioner but to file for United States Senator telling him that if he were willing to do this the Republican Party would support him and $50 would at once be paid him for his filing fee and $500, the estimated amount of his campaign expenses, would also be paid to him. He swore that, on July 2d, he gave the respondent $50 and, on the next day, handed him a $500 bond.\n  The respondent took the witness stand and admitted that he 'know at the time of testifying (before the Senate Committee) that he had received $ 500 and $50 and what he was saying was not true.'\n  In charging the jury, the judge stated that the respondent could not be convicted if he testified carelessly, negligently, or hastily, but the jury must find that his testimony was intentionally untrue and that he did not believe it true when he gave it. And, respecting the retraction of his former testimony, the judge stated that the jury might consider the retraction along with the other evidence 'on the question of whether or not considering what the defendant testified on the day prior and his act of testifying again the following day and what he said in his testimony, the defendant wilfully, that is, intentionally testified falsely in his testimony on the day before in the matters charged against him.'\n  The respondent requested the following instructions:\n'The Jury are instructed that even if you find that the defendant in this case made false answers to the questions which were put to him at the hearing before the Senate Committee in question, and if you also find that while this hearing was yet continuing and while the matter was yet pending before the Senate Committee, the defendant corrected any erroneous or false statements that were made, if any, then you will find the defendant not guilty.'\n\n'The Jury are instructed that if you find the defendant, in the latter portion of his examination before the Senate \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 572]\n\u00a0\n Committee, corrected statements that may have been incorrect or even intentionally false, made prior to the correction of the defendant, then you will find the defendant not guilty.'\n\n  These were refused and an exception granted. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty, sentence was imposed, and the respondent appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed the judgment,5 holding that the trial court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the question whether the respondent had fully and fairly retracted and corrected his original false statements. In the course of its opinion the court stated the following would have been a proper charge and failure to give a charge of such tenor was reversible error:\n'The jury are charged that the law encourages the correction of erroneous and even intentionally false statements made by a witness upon a trial or hearing, and so, if you shall find and believe from the evidence that defendant made false answers to the questions or any of them which were put to him at the hearing before the Senate Subcommittee (which questions are set out in the indictment and which questions the court has already in this charge called specifically to your attention), yet that defendant, while the hearing was continuing and unfinished, again took the witness stand, and then and there fully corrected all erroneous or false statements, if any, which had theretofore been made by him in answer to said questions, you should find the defendant not guilty.'\n\n  The respondent insists that reversal of his conviction was right because (1) Congress exceeded its power in adopting Resolution No. 215, since it cannot legislate for the purpose of regulating primary elections; ( 2) perjury can only be committed if an oath be taken in a case wherein a law of the United States authorizes an oath \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 573]\n\u00a0\n to be administered, and the committee hearing was not such a case; (3) the false testimony concerned an immaterial matter; and (4) the whole of a witness' evidence must be taken together and, if his testimony be ultimately true, his indictment for perjury cannot be predicated thereon.\n  Little need be said with respect to the first three positions. That it is within in constitutional province of Congress to institute investigations and to compel evidence with a view to possible exercise of its legislative function6 or possible discharge of its duty to determine the validity of the election of its members7 is settled. Rev.St.  101,8 is a law of the United States authorizing any member of either house of Congress to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter pending in either house of Congress or any committee thereof. The materiality of the respondent's false answers is clear in view of the scope of the inquiry. The resolution authorized the committee 'to investigate the campaign expenditures of the various candidates for the United States Senate, the names of the persons * * * subscribing, the amount contributed, the method of expenditure, and all facts in relation thereto. * * *'\n  We come to the substantial question which moved us to grant the writ of certiorari. We hold the District Jduge was right in refusing to charge as requested by the respondent and the judgment should not have been reversed on account of his failure so to do. The respondent admitted he gave intentionally false testimony on September 22d. His recantation on the following day cannot alter this fact. He would have us hold that so long as the cause or proceeding in which false testimony is given is not closed there remains a locus poenitentiae of which \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 574]\n\u00a0\n he was entitled to and did avail himself. The implications and results of such a doctrine prove its unsoundness. Perjury is an obstruction of justice; its perpetration well may affect the dearest concerns of the parties before a tribunal. Deliberate material falsification under oath constitutes the crime of perjury and the crime is complete when a witness' statement has once been made. It is argued that to allow retraction of perjured testimony promotes the discovery of the truth and, if made before the proceeding is concluded, can do no harm to the parties. The argument overlooks the tendency of such a view to encourage false swearing in the belief that if the falsity be not discovered before the end of the hearing it will have its intended effect, but, if discovered, the witness may purge himself of crime by resuming his role as witness and substituting the truth for his previous falsehood. It ignores the fact that the oath administered to the witness calls on him freely to disclose the truth in the first instance and not to put the court and the parties to the disadvantage, hinderance, and delay of ultimately extracting the truth by cross-examination, by extraneous investigation, or other collateral means.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that the testimony originally given and allowed then to stand as his final statement on the subject of inquiry falls clearly within the definition of section 125 of the Criminal Code ( 18 \nU.S.C.A.  231) the respondent insists that the authorities, English and American, demonstrate that his retraction before the conclusion of the proceedings in which he testified absolve him and preclude a conviction. Perjury has been a common-law crime since at least the Seventeenth Century. Quite generally the conception empbodied in the common-law definition of perjury has been embodied in statutes. This is true of section 125. But it cannot be said that there is any respectable body of authority under the common law or statute in England or in the United States to support the respondent's position. On \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 575]\n\u00a0\n the contrary, the cases in which the courts have dealt directly and specifically with the question here for decision are surprisingly few. The respondent plants himself upon Roy v. Carr, 1 Siderfin, 418, 82 Eng.Rep. 1191, a case decided in 1669, which he ciaims established the doctrine for which he contends and has been followed both in England and in this country. A critical examination of the case arouses grave doubt that it held, or was intended to hold, that a retraction of a witness' false testimony negatives the commission of perjury and in later cases the English courts have so intimated and have said that if it stood for such a proposition it probably would not be followed. \n9\n Several later English decisions squint in the opposite direction and some of them come near to refute the respondent's argument with respect to the English law. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n  Decisions of state courts of last resort in this country do not make a much better case for the argument. One state Supreme Court seems to have held directly in accordance with the contention in an appeal from a conviction of perjury. \n11\n One lower court case is in accord. \n12\n In one state court of last resort wherein the question arose in a slander suit where the defendant was alleged to have improperly charged a witness with having committed perjury in another proceeding, the court answered it favorably to respondent's claim. 13 The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York has definitely held with the respondent upon the point in a case where the witness corrected his false testimony immediately and told the truth \n\n[300 \nU.S. 564\n, 576]\n\u00a0\n although, in that case, the conviction was reversed on several grounds any one of which would have been adequate for reversal. \n14\n The Court of Appeals of New York has not spoken on the subject and in a later case a lower court has refused to follow the decision mentioned where the contradictory statement was not part of the same examination at which the false statement was made. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n  While we should accord respectful consideration to decisions of the English and American courts supporting the respondent's view, the research of counsel and our own examination discloses that there is no substantial body of authority favoring it. As will appear by scrutiny of the cases cited in note 1, the lower federal courts have not dealt with the question often and while their expressions may not be entirely consonant it may be said that they preponderate against the respondent's contention. We are free, therefore, to give such meaning and effect to section 125 of the Criminal Code (18 \nU.S.C.A.  231) as in justice we think ought to be attributed to it. The plain words of the statute and the public policy which called for its enactment alike demand we should hold that the telling of a deliberate lie by a witness completes the crime defined by the law. This is not to say that the correction of an innocent mistake, or the elaboration of an incomplete answer, may not demonstrate that there was no willful intent to swear falsely. We have here no such case.\n  The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. So ordered.\n  Reversed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Loubriel v.

On December 2, 1935, the court filed its special findings of fact, conclusions of law, and opinion and entered judgment in favor of plaintiff or $1,317,087.21. 82 Ct.Cl. 135.\n\n 1. \nPlaintiff contends that the petition for the writ of certiorari came too late and that therefore this court is without jurisdiction. The petition was filed under 28 U.S.C.  288(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  288(b). Section 350, title 28, U.S.Code (28 U.S.C.A.  350) limits the time to three months after entry of judgment. Defendant filed timely motion for new trial which was overruled March 2, 1936. May 13 it applied for leave to file a second motion for new trial. The application stated that it was made pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  282 (28 U.S.C.A.  282),1 and that the motion was attached to the application. The court granted leave and defendant, May 18, filed its second motion for a new trial. The record does not include the motion. After hearing argument the \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 420]\n\u00a0\n court, June 8, overruled the motion. July 8, defendant filed petition for certiorari.\n Plaintiff assumes that defendant's second motion for a new trial was made under section 282 and argues that the running of time allowed for filing petition for certiorari was not postponed until the court disposed of that motion. But it does not appear that the motion was in fact one authorized by section 282. Aside from mere recital in the application for leave, there is nothing to indicate that it was not one made under rule 91 of the Court of Claims.\n That rule declares: 'Whenever either party desires to question the correctness or the sufficiency of the court's conclusions on its findings of fact or to amend the same, the complaining party shall file a motion which shall be known as a motion for a new trial. All grounds relied upon for any or all of said objections shall be included in one motion. After the court has announced its decision upon such motion no other motion for a new trial, except that provided by United States Code, title 28, section 282, shall be filed by the same party unless by leave of court. Motions for new trial, except as provided by section 175 of the Judicial Code (U.S. Code, title 28, sec. 282 (28 U.S.C.A.  282)), shall be filed within 60 days from the time the judgment of the court is announced.'\n Section 282 provides: 'The Court of Claims, at any time while any claim is pending before it, or on appeal from it, or within two years next after the final disposition of such claim, may, on motion, on behalf of the United States, grant a new trial and stay the payment of any judgment therein, upon such evidence, cumulative or otherwise, as shall satisfy the court that any fraud, wrong, or injustice in the premises has been done to the United States.'\n The rule expressly excepts motions under section 282 from those for the filing of which leave of court must be obtained. The statute plainly implies that in accordance \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 421]\n\u00a0\n with its terms defendant may as of right apply for a new trial. The record does not contain anything to indicate that it was one made upon evidence or otherwise in accordance with statute. Cf. In re District of Columbia, \n180 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 21 S.Ct. 357. In the absence of definite showing to that effect, it will not be held that the United States applied for or that the court entertained and granted an application for leave so expressly shown to be unnecessary. On this record, it is reasonably to be inferred, and we find, that the second motion was one filed in accordance with the rule under which application for leave was necessary and not one authorized by the statute for the filing of which permission of the court was not needed. It is clear that the three months' period, section 350, did not commence to run until the court disposed of that motion and did not expire until long after the defendant had filed its petition for this writ. It is well settled that the time within which application may be made for review in this court does not commence to run until after disposition of motion for a new trial seasonably filed and entertained.

This court has jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nThe jurisdiction of the lower court was limited to claims sued on before the expiration of the period within which the United States consented to be sued. It did not extend to any cause of action which was not alleged in plaintiff's original petition. As the United States may not be sued without its consent, causes of action not alleged within the period allowed may not be enforced. Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 8 S.Ct. 82. The amended petition was not filed within the time allowed; no cause of action was by it brought within the power of \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 422]\n\u00a0\n the court. Taylor Co. v.

The judgment may not be sustained as to any item that is not included in a cause of action set up in the original petition or that was by the findings of the lower court or otherwise put upon a ground not there alleged. Harrison v. Nixon, 9 Pet. 483, 503; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177, 209; Garland v. Davis, 4 How. 131, 148. It may not be upheld as to any item that is not supported by definite findings of fact extending to all essential issues and which, unaided by statements in the court's conclusions of law or its opinion, are clearly sufficient to entitle plaintiff to recover. United States v. Esnault-Pelterie, \n299 \nU.S. 201, 207\n, 57 S.Ct. 159, 162.\n The original petition is in paragraphs designated by Roman numerals; the substance of each may be briefly shown:\n I. Reference is made to the act conferring jurisdiction. II. Plaintiff for many years was the owner of funds held in trust by defendant; there existed various treaties and agreements between plaintiff and defendant whereby the trust funds were to be managed and invested by defendant and the interest thereon paid over to the national treasurer of plaintiff. III. From and after passage of the Act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 495 (called the Curtis Act), defendant impounded all funds of plaintiff, refused to further pay them to plaintiff's national treasurer, and proceeded to disburse them for various purposes. IV. The only authority given by that act for the disbursement of plaintiff's funds is section 19.2 After that act, Congress passed others giving authority for the expenditure of plaintiff's funds, but no subsequent act gave authority for the ex- \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 423]\n\u00a0\n penditure of the funds hereinafter mentioned. VI. From 'July 1st, 1898, until the present time, defendant, in violation of its duty as trustee of the funds of plaintiff, in violation of the rights of plaintiff under its various treaties and agreements with defendant, and without authority of Congress, has spent large sums of the trust funds of plaintiff.' VII. At all times mentioned in the petition R.S.  2097 was in force. \n3\n VIII. 'Defendant has thus spent, in violation of law, a large amount of the trust funds of plaintiff.' The exact amount will be shown by the books and records of defendant.\n The prayer of the petition is that defendant be required to file in this cause a statement showing its expenditures of plaintiff's funds 'during said period,' the purposes for which, and dates when, such expenditures were made, and the authority of law, if any, which authorized defendant to make such expenditures; 'that, if necessary thereafter, plaintiff be permitted to amend this petition' and that plaintiff have judgment against the defendant in such sum or sums as shall appear to the court to have been expended without authority of law, with interest at 6 per cent.\n This petition does not include any cause of action that accrued prior to July 1, 1898. Nor is recovery sought on mere failure of defendant to pay plaintiff's funds to its national treasurer or to the Seminoles per capita. The gist of the petition is that defendant disbursed funds of plaintiff for 'various purposes' (par. III); and in viola- \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 424]\n\u00a0\n tion of its duty as trustee and of plaintiff's rights under 'treaties and agreements' and 'without authority of Congress, has spent large sums of the trust funds of plaintiff' (par. VI). The petition extends to no amount not 'thus spent' (par. VIII). It prays statement by defendant only as to 'expenditures' of plaintiff's funds 'during said period,' and seeks judgment only for such sums as appear to the court to have been 'expended.'\n While the amended petition came too late to bring in any additional cause of action or to change grounds on which plaintiff rested its suit, it will be taken into account to the extent that it usefully gives plaintiff's statement of details of causes of action alleged in the original petition and for comparison with the court's special findings of fact. It describes thirteen claims; ten of these are in whole or in part included in the judgment. The following statement shows: (1) Paragraphs of the amended petition; (2) Amounts claimed in each; (3) Items identified by arabic numbers used in the opinion below; (4) Amounts of items considered; ( 5) Findings identified by Roman numerals; (6) Amounts included in the judgment; (7) Amounts excluded below.\n[]\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) III $ 63,353.42 1 $ 61,563.42 IV $ 61,563.42 4 1,790.00 VII 1,790.00 IV 304,551.28 2 150,000.00 V $150,000.00 3 154,551.28 VI 154,551.28 V 90,597.20 5 3,097.20 IX 3,097.20 750.00 750.00 57,500.00 57,500.00 (29,250.00) * 29,250.00 * VI 15,000.00 6 15,000.00 X 15,000.00 VII 10,000.00 7 10,000.00 XI 9,068.24 931.76 []\n* Not dealt with in the opinion. This amount is made up of a duplication of $26,750, interest for 1899-1909 excluded from consideration because considered in item 8, plus seeming error of $2,500 in calculation of judgment allowed.\n\n\n[299 U.S. 417, 425]\n\u00a0\n []\n\n\n (1)\n (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) \nVIII 864,702.58 8 864,702.58 XII 864,702.58 IX 154,455.30 9 154,455.30 XIII 154,455.30 X 66,247.37 10 51,460.08 XIV 51,460.08 11 3,909.96 XIV 3,909.96 12 4,348.74 XV 4,348.74 (6,528.59) 6,528.59 XI 178,533.42 13 178,533.42 XVI 1,350.55 177,182.87\n[]\n Not dealt with in the opinion. This amount apparently was not claimed in proposed findings of fact, although claimed in amended petition, i. e. included in claim for $66,247.37.\n The lower court disallowed all of items all of items 2, 6, and 10 and parts of 5, 7, and 13. Plaintiff has not asked review. Defendant's prayer for reversal does not extend to any part of items 11, 12, or 13.\n Items 1, 4, and 7 are by the amended petition indicated to be outside the period alleged in the original petition-from July 1, 1898, to the time of the commencement of the suit. The findings fail to show that any part of these amounts is included in any cause of action alleged in the original petition to have accrued in that period. All of these items must be deducted from the judgment.\n Item 3, $154,551.28, is a part of $304,551.28 first described in the amended petition. Of that amount $150,000 (item 2) was disallowed. The amount included in the judgment rests on special finding VI which is to the effect that commencing with the Act of July 26, 1866 (14 Stat. 263, 264), up to and including the Act of April 30, 1908 (35 Stat. 91), Congress annually appropriated $25,000, being the interest at 5 per cent. on the $500,000 fund provided in the Eighth article of the Treaty of Aug. 7, 1856 (11 Stat. 702) for the purpose of making per capita payments, and that the United States disbursed the sums thus appropriated for the years involved, either by direct payment per capita to members \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 426]\n\u00a0\n of the tribe, or by cash payment to the treasurer of the Seminole Nation, except interest in years between 1867 and 1879, inclusive, the total of which is $92,051.28, and interest in the years 1907 to 1909, inclusive, amounting to $62,500; and that these items of interest were neither disbursed to members of the tribe nor paid to the treasurer.\n But defendant's retention or other disposition of the amounts of interest in years between 1867 and 1879 is not shown by the findings to have been within the period covered by the original petition. For that reason, $92,051.28 must be deducted. And for another reason all of item 3 must be eliminated from the judgment. The finding merely shows that defendant did not pay or disburse the amount included in that item to the national treasurer or to members of the tribe. That is not enough. The suit is not to recover money withheld, but only for that illegally disbursed or spent by defendant.\n Item 5-$90,597.20-as described in the amended petition is interest on the permanent school fund provided for in the third article of the Treaty of March 21, 1866 (14 Stat. 756). The judgment includes $3,097.20 of that item on account of interest for the years 1867-1874. But it is not shown that any cause of action accrued in respect of that sum after July 1, 1898. The item also includes $750, a part of the interest for 1907 found not to have been paid by defendant to the tribal treasurer. But, as shown above, mere failure so to pay is not sufficient to constitute any cause of action alleged in the original petition. The balance of item 5 includes $57,500 payments to the tribal treasurer before the passage of the Curtis Act and before commencement of the period covered by the original petition. They must be excluded. The remainder of this item is also a part of item 8 about to be considered. See opinion below, 82 Ct.Cl. 154.\n Item 8-$864,702.58-is based on a claim which is described in the amended petition, in substance as follows: \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 427]\n\u00a0\n After the passage of the Curtis Act, defendant impounded all the funds of plaintiff, and assumed full administrative control over the disbursement of same. Notwithstanding 'the plain inhibition in said section 19 that no payments thereafter should be made to 'the tribal governments or to any officer thereof for disbursement', yet in violation of said section the defendant illegally disbursed the amounts hereinafter set forth, derived from' stated sources. \n4\n 'Therefore, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in the amount of $864,702.58 for the violation of said section 19 of said Act of June 28, 1898.'\n This claim is not included in the original petition. It states defendant refused to make payments to the tribal treasurer. Finding XII shows that defendant did pay to the treasurer all the amounts included in the item. The original petition not only failed to lay foundation for the claim, but in effect excluded every part of it. The item is included in the judgment on a basis of fact directly opposed to the allegations of the original petition relied on by plaintiff until long after the expiration of the period within which the United States permitted suit in respect of it. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover any part of the item.\n\n 3. \nItem 9 is $154,455.30. Unlike the items considered above, it may be held sufficiently alleged in the original petition. The amended petition, par. IX, gives details as follows: The Original Seminole Agreement ratified by Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567, provides that $ 500,000 \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 428]\n\u00a0\n of the funds belonging to the Seminoles shall be set apart as a permanent school fund and be held by the United States at 5 per cent. interest. The school fund was established March 6, 1906. Defendant, in violation of the agreement and without authority of law 'disbursed from the principal thereof the amount of $154,455.30.' Therefore that amount 'is due the Seminole Nation from the defendant.' As to it the court found that the Secretary of the Interior did disburse from the principal of the permanent school fund in 1920 and 1921 'per capita payments' amounting to $32,445.56; in 1921 'equalization of allotments,' $490.22; in each of the years 1922 to 1930 payments for 'Education' amounting in all to $121,519.52. In its opinion the court said: 'That Congress had the power to change the terms of the agreement and authorize these payments, is well established,5 but we find no act of Congress that either in express terms or by necessary implication authorizes any of them. It must, therefore, be held that they were illegally made and that the Seminole 'permanent school fund'-a trust fund-was unlawfully depleted thereby. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum claimed.'\n Congress contemplated, at least as early as 1898 at the time of the passage of the Curtis Act and the ratification of the Seminole Agreement, that the tribal government was soon to be terminated. The Act of March 3, 1903,  8, 32 Stat. 1008, declared that it should not continue after March 4, 1906. Congress, by Joint Resolution March 2, 1906, 34 Stat. 822, continued tribal existence and tribal government until all tribal property and its proceeds should be distributed among individual members. The Act of April 26, 1906,  28, 34 Stat. 148, continued tribal existence and government for all authorized \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 429]\n\u00a0\n purposes until otherwise provided by law. By acts passed in 1906 and 1908 Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to take possession of all buildings used for governmental, school, or other tribal purposes, together with the furniture and land pertaining thereto and to sell the same and deposit the proceeds to the credit of the Seminoles. \n6\n Liquidation of Seminole property and distribution of its proceeds per capita went forward under direction of Congress. \n7\n And, by May 25, 1918 (40 Stat. 561), when the Congress passed the act making appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, under which defendant claims that the per capita payments here in question were made, the need of a permanent school fund had almost ended. At the hearing upon that measure before the House Committee on Indian Affairs,8 the Bureau, through the Assistant Commissioner, reported that one of the two Seminole Academies had already ceased to exist, that the other was still used, but that public school privileges were within the reach of almost every pupil and that the fund was not needed for the support of any other school. It was on the recommendation of the Bureau that Congress included in section 18 of this act a clause specifically authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to pay to the enrolled members of the Seminole Tribe entitled to share in its funds, or to their lawful heirs, out of the Seminole school fund not to exceed $100 per capita and directed payment to be made under rules and regulations prescribed by the Sec- \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 430]\n\u00a0\n retary. \n9\n The act, like earlier ones10 and those making appropriations for fiscal years ending, respectively, June 30, 1920, and 1921,11 contained a proviso directing that in the specified fiscal year no money shall be expended from tribal funds without specific appropriation by Congress except 'Equalization of allotments, per capita and other payments authorized by law. ...' By regulations promulgated June 17, 1918, par. 14, the Secretary required disbursements to continue 'until all claims are paid or until further orders of the Department.'\n Plaintiff does not claim that section 18 of the appropriation act of 1918 did not specifically authorize the use of the principal to make the per capita payments here in question. But it contends authority so to use that fund ceased with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919. The payments authorized constituted a distribution looking to the ultimate disposition of all tribal property. The provision expressed no limitation in respect of the time \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 431]\n\u00a0\n within which they were to be made. The occasion and purpose of the enactment tend strongly to negative any implication that Seminoles entitled to participate in the distribution would be barred if the Secretary failed to cause payments to be made them within the fiscal year. The provisos contained in the appropriation acts for the fiscal years 1920 and 1921 during which the per capita payments in controversy were made reasonably may be deemed sufficient to authorize them. Weight is to be given to the Secretary's regulations, par. 13, which declared that all suspended or withheld payments were 'to be disbursed at such times and in such amounts as the best interest of the persons, to whom such suspended or withheld payments are due, may demand.' Plaintiff's contention that it is entitled to recover upon the ground that the per capita payments were not made within time allowed therefor is without merit. The amount of the per capita payments must be eliminated from the judgment.\n As to the amount of $490.20 paid out of the school fund for 'equalization of allotments,' the defendant relies upon a provision in the appropriation act of February 14, 1920,  18, 41 Stat. 427, declaring: 'That hereafter no money thall be expended from tribal funds ... without specific appropriation ... except as follows: Equalization of allotments ... and other payments authorized by law to individual members of the respective tribes.' But defendant fails to show that the excepted payments were 'authorized by law.' This amount was properly included in the judgment.\n As to the sum of $121,519.52 made up of payments from 1922 through 1930 for 'Education,' the sole question is whether Congress authorized the use of the principal of the permanent school fund for that purpose. The appropriation acts applicable to these years authorized the Secretary of the Interior to continue Seminole \n\n[299 U.S. 417, 432]\n\u00a0\n schools from the tribal funds. \n12\n It must be assumed that when enacting these measures Congress took into account the fact that the Seminole school fund in pursuance of its authority had been so depleted that interest on the amount remaining in it would not meet even the lessened requirements. Its failure to limit expenditure for education to interest on the permanent fund and adherence to substantially the same form of words yearly throughout the entire period sufficiently indicate the intention of Congress that disbursements for that purpose were not limited to the interest and that principal was to be used. The inclusion of that amount in the judgment cannot be sustained.\n The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded to the lower court with directions for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] R.S.  1088; Judicial Code,  175, Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1141. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'That no payment of any moneys on any account whatever shall hereafter be made by the United States to any of the tribal governments or to any officer thereof for disbursement, but payments of all sums to members of said tribes shall be made under direction of the Secretary of the Interior by an officer appointed by him; and per capita payments shall be made direct to each individual in lawful money of the United States, and the same shall not be liable to the payment of any previously contracted obligation.' 30 Stat. 502 (25 U.S.C.A.  117 note). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'No funds belonging to any Indian tribe with which treaty relations exist shall be applied in any manner not authorized by such treaty, or by express provisions of law; nor shall money appropriated to execute a treaty be transferred or applied to any other purpose, unless expressly authorized by law.' 25 U.S.C.  122 (25 U.S.C.A.  122). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \n\"Treaty of August 7, 1856, Funds $212,500.00 \"Treaty of March 21, 1866, Funds 29,750.00 \"Act of March 2nd, 1899 (30 Stat. 933) Funds 622,156.87 \"Indian Moneys, Proceeds of Labor Fund 295.71 ___ $864,702.58\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Lone Wolf v.

Wade and Perry Smith, both of Terre Haute, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this suit in the federal court for the Northern District of Illinois to recover war risk in- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n surance on the life of her minor son, Benson Charles Williams, who died while serving in the navy. Trial by jury having been waived, the court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 86 F.(2d) 746.\n The findings show: Plaintiff's son was born August 27, 1901, and January 13, 1919, enlisted in the navy for the period of his minority. At that time defendant issued a certificate of term insurance binding itself, in case of his death while insured, to pay plaintiff $10,000 in 240 equal monthly installments; he directed defendant to deduct premiums from his pay; his parents executed a writing by which they consented to the enlistment, released their claim to his pay, approved the transactions between him and defendant, and declared that their consent was given on the condition that, during enlistment, he would carry war risk insurance in the sum of $10,000 in behalf of his mother. July 20, 1920, he made written request that his insurance be terminated. Thereafter, defendant made no deductions from his pay on account of premiums. The insured died June 30, 1921. At all times until his death his uncollected pay was more than enough to keep the insurance in force. Upon learning of her son's death plaintiff demanded payment of the insurance. When notified by defendant of her son's cancellation she repudiated it, offered to pay all premiums, reiterated her claim as beneficiary, and, defendant having rejected it, brought this suit.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned as follows: Plaintiff's consent was essential to the enlistment and was given on condition that the insurance be maintained. The minor and defendant could not set the condition at naught. Defendant could not avail itself of his services, to which it was entitled only if his mother so agreed, and ignore the condition upon which the agreement was obtained. Defendant was charged with notice of plain- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n tiff's interest as beneficiary and, the cancellation not having been ratified by her, defendant was bound to collect the premiums and maintain the insurance by deductions from the pay of the insured. On that basis the court concluded that the insurance remained in force and that plaintiff is entitled to recover.\n The opinion strongly puts the considerations that make in favor of plaintiff's claim but neglects the distinction between private employment of minors and their service in army or navy and fails to give effect to the law applicable to contracts of enlistment and to the terms upon which the government granted the war risk insurance here in question. In virtue of its power to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy and to make rules for the government of land and naval forces, the Congress may require military service of adults and minors alike. \n1\n The power of the United States may be exerted to supersede parents' control and their right to have the services of minor sons who are wanted and fit for military service. \n2\n And the Congress may confer upon minors the privilege of serving in land or naval forces, authorize them to enlist, or draft them upon such terms as it may deem expedient and just. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n The statute under which plaintiff's son was accepted declares that minors between ages of 14 and 18 years shall not be enlisted in the navy without the consent of their parents. \n4\n It means that, while minors over 18 may enlist without parental permission, the government elects not to take those between 14 and 18 unless their parents are willing to have them go. It is a determination by Congress that minors over 14 have capacity to make contracts for service in the navy. \n5\n And it is in harmony with rulings under the common law to the effect that enlistment of a minor for military service is not voidable by him or his parents. \n6\n Enlistment is more than a contract; it effects a change of status. \n7\n It operates to emancipate minors at least to the extent that by enlistment they become bound to serve subject to rules governing enlisted men and entitled to have and freely to dispose of their pay. \n8\n Upon enlistment of plain- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n tiff's son and until his death he became entirely subject to the control of the United States in respect of all things pertaining to or affecting his service.\n The statute does not confer upon or leave with the parents any right to condition consent to their sons' enlistment. No act of Congress permits enlistment of minors upon condition or upon the qualified consent of parents nor does any act authorize recruiting officers to bind the United States to carry, or to require an enlisted man to carry, war risk insurance for his own protection or for the benefit of any person. It follows that defendant was not bound by the condition on which the trial court found that the parents consented to the enlistment of their minor son. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n War risk insurance was made available to those in active military service for the greater protection of themselves and their dependents. \n10\n By the insurance contract, of which applicable provisions of statutes and regulations constitute a part,11 the insured minor was authorized to allot a part of his pay for the payment of premiums,12 to change beneficiaries without their consent13 and to cancel the insurance in whole or in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n part. \n14\n It follows that the cancelation was valid and plaintiff is not entitled to recover. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n302 \nU.S. 779\n, 58 S.Ct. 361, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tarble's Case (1871) 13 Wall. 397, 408.

Sabine Towing Co.   \n300 \nU.S. 342\n (1937)   ]\n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n  Messrs. H. C. Hughes, of Galveston, Tex., and M. G. Adams, of Beaumont, Tex., for petitioner.\n  Mr. M. A. Grace, of New Orleans, La., for respondents.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 [June 5, 1920, c. 250,  33, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 \nU.S.C.  688 (46 \nU.S.C.A.  688] gives a cause of action for damages to the personal representative of a seaman who has suffered death in the course of his employment by reason of his employer's negligence. The question is whether the liability abates where the beneficiary of the cause of action, in this case the mother of the seaman, dies during the pendency of a suit in her behalf.\n  The steam towboat, Edgar F. Coney, sank on January 28, 1930, with the loss of all on board. The respondent Sabine Towing Company, Inc., the owner of the boat, filed a libel in a United States District Court in Texas for the limitation of liability. In that proceeding claims for damages were filed by the personal representatives of several members of the crew. Among such claims was one for the pecuniary damage suffered through the death of the second mate of the vessel, Edward C. Van Beeck. He died unmarried, leaving a mother and several brothers. There being neither wife nor child nor father, the mother was the sole beneficiary of the statutory cause of action. This results from the provisions of the Employers' Liability Act (45 \nU.S.C.  51 (45 \nU.S.C.A.  51)), governing injuries to railway employees, which is made applicable by the Merchant Marine Act in case of injuries to seamen. Cf. Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 376\n, 176. The mother was appointed administratrix of her son's estate, and acting as such administratrix filed her claim for damages. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 344]\n\u00a0\n She died in July, 1931, and thereupon the petitioner, a brother of the dead seaman, succeeded to her office by appointment duly made, and was substituted as claimant in the pending suit. In that suit a Commissioner reported that the mother had suffered loss up to the time of her death in the sum of $700, and that there should be an award of that amount for the use of her estate. The District Court dismissed the claim on the ground that at her death the liability abated, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. 85 F.(2d) 478. To settle the meaning of an important act of Congress, we granted certiorari.\n  The statutory cause of action to recover damages for death ushered in a new policy and broke with old traditions. Its meaning is likely to be misread if shreds of the discarded policy are treated as still clinging to it and narrowing its scope. The case of Higgins v. Butcher, Noy 18; Yelv. 89, which arose in the King's Bench in 1606, is the starting point of the rule, long accepted in our law, though at times with mutterings of disapproval,1 that in an action of tort damages are not recoverable by any one for the death of a human being. \n2\n The rule is often viewed as a derivative of the formula 'actio personalis moritur cum persona,' a maxim which 'is one of some antiquity,' though 'its origin is obscure and post- classical.'3 Even in classical times, however, the Roman law enforced the principle that 'no action of an essen- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 345]\n\u00a0\n tially penal character could be commenced after the death of the person responsible for the injury.'4 Vengeance, though permissible during life, was not to 'reach beyond the grave.'5 There was also an accepted doctrine that no money value could be put on the life of a freeman. \n6\n The post- classical maxim, taken up by Coke and his successors,7 gave a new currency to these teachings of the Digest, and, it seems, a new extension. \n8\n But the denial of a cause of action for wrongs producing death has been ascribed to other sources also. The explanation has been found at times in the common-law notion that trespass as a civil wrong is drowned in a felony. \n9\n As to the adequacy of this explanation, grave doubt has been expressed. \n10\n None the less, the rule as to felony merger seems to have coalesced, even if in a confused way, with the rule as to abatement,11 and the effect of the two in combination was to fasten upon the law a doctrine which it took a series of statutes to dislodge. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 346]\n\u00a0\n  The adoption of Lord Campbell's Act in 1846 (9 & 10 Vict. c. 93), giving an action to the executor for the use of wife, husband, parent, or child, marks the dawn of a new era. In this country, statutes substantially the same in tenor followed in quick succession in one state after another, till today there is not a state of the union in which a remedy is lacking. \n12\n Congress joined in the procession, first with the Employers' Liability Act for railway employees (45 \nU.S.C.  51-59 (45 \nU.S. C.A.  51-59)), next with the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 for seamen and their survivors (46 U.S.C.  688 (46 U.S.C.A.  688)), and again with an act of the same year (March 30, 1920, c. 111,  1, 2, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U. S.C.  761, 762 (46 U.S.C.A.  761, 762)), not limited to seamen, which states the legal consequences of death upon the high seas.\n  As already pointed out, the personal representative of a seaman laying claim to damages under the Merchant Marine Act is to have the benefit of 'all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees.' 46 U.S.C.  688 (46 U.S.C.A.  688). The statutes thus referred to as a standard display a double aspect. One of these is visible in the Employers' Liability Act as it stood when first enacted in 1908. Under the law as then in force (April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C.  51 ( 45 U.S.C.A.  51)), the personal representative does not step into the shoes of the employee, recovering the damages that would have been his if he had lived. On the contrary, by section 1 of the statute a new cause of action is created for the benefit of survivors or dependents of designated classes, the recovery being limited to the losses sustained by them as contrasted with any losses sustained by the decedent. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 347]\n\u00a0\n However, with the adoption of an amendment in 1910 (April 5, 1910, c. 143 ,  2, 36 Stat. 291, 45 U.S.C.  59 (45 U.S.C.A.  59)), a new aspect of the statute emerges into view. Section 2 as then enacted continues any cause of action belonging to the decedent, without abrogating or diminishing the then existing cause of action for the use of his survivors. 14 'Although originating in the same wrongful act or neglect, the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being embraced in the other. One is for the wrong to the injured person, and is confined to his personal loss and suffering before he died, while the other is for the wrong to the beneficiaries, and is confined to their pecuniary loss through his death.'15 It is loss of this last order, and no other, that is the subject of the present suit. So far as the record shows, the seaman died at once upon the sinking of the vessel. In any event, there is no claim that his injuries were not immediately fatal. \n16\n To what extent the present problem would be altered, if intermediate loss and suffering had been made the basis of a recovery, we have no occasion to consider. Our decision must be limited to the necessities of the case before us.\n  Viewing the cause of action as one to compensate a mother for the pecuniary loss caused to her by the negligent killing of her son, we think the mother's death does not abate the suit, but that the administrator may continue it, for the recovery of her loss up to the moment of her death, though not for anything thereafter,17 the damages when collected to be paid to her estate. Such is the rule in many of the state courts in which like statutes are in force. It is the rule in New York, in Pennsylvania, in New Jersey, in Oklahoma, in Georgia, in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 348]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky, in North Carolina, and under statutes somewhat different in Connecticut and Massachusetts. \n18\n It is also the rule in the lower federal courts, applying the statute of Illinois as well as the Act of Congress in respect of death upon the high seas. \n19\n These cases take the ground that 'the damages awarded for the negligent act are such as result to the property rights of the person or persons for whose benefit the cause of action was created.'20 Indeed, even at common law, since statutes adopted in the reign of Edward III (4 Edw. III, c. 7; 25 Edw. III, Stat. 5, c. 5), which were extended beyond their letter by an equitable construction, an administrator might recover where the wrong was an injury to property and not an injury to the person. \n21\n The general rule was said to be that 'executors and administrators are the representatives of the temporal property, that is, the debts and goods of the deceased, but not of their wrongs, except where those wrongs operate to the temporal injury of their personal estate'22 When we re \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 349]\n\u00a0\n member that under the death statutes an independent cause of action is created in favor of the beneficiaries for their pecuniary damages, the conclusion is not difficult that the cause of action once accrued is not divested or extinguished by the death of one or more of the beneficiaries thereafter, but survives, like a cause of action for injury to a property right or interest, to the extent that the estate of the deceased beneficiary is proved to be impaired. To that extent, if no farther, a new property right or interest, or one analogous thereto, has been brought into being through legislative action. True, there are decisions under the death statutes, of some states that teach a different doctrine, refusing to permit a recovery by the administrator after the beneficiary has died, 23 though the ruling has been made at times with scant discussion of the problem. Indeed, the problem now before us was not always presented to the attention of the court, for at times the death of the beneficiary followed hard upon the death of the person negligently killed or the claim was not urged that there had been damage in the interval. We think the cases favoring survival within the limits already indicated are supported by preponderant authority and also by the better reason. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 350]\n\u00a0\n  Nothing at war with that conclusion will be found in our opinion in Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Wells-Dickey Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 161, 59\n A.L.R. 758, on which the court below leaned heavily in deciding as it did. The suit was under the Employers' Liability Act which gives a cause of action (a) to the widow or children; ( b) to the parents if no widow or children survive; or (c) to dependent next of kin, if there be no surviving widow, child, or parent. A mother survived the employee, but died before an administrator was appointed. The holding was that the beneficial interest did not shift upon her death to members of class (c). 'The failure to bring the action in the mother's lifetime did not result in creating a new cause of action after her death for the benefit of the sister.' \n275 \nU.S. 161\n, at page 164, 74, 59 A.L.R. 758.24 The question was not raised whether the damages, if any, suffered by the mother between the son's death and her own would have been recoverable, if proved.\n  Nor is the case at hand affected by statutes, invoked by the respondent, which regulate the continuance of a proceeding in a court of the United States by the substitution of the executor or administrator of a party dying while the suit is pending. 28 U.S.C.A.  778. The present claimant is not the administrator of the deceased beneficiary, but an administrator de bonis non, who has succeeded to the office of the original administrator. \n25\n The order substituting him as a party was made without objection, and he continued in the suit thereafter as if he had filed a claim anew.\n  Death statutes have their roots in dissatisfaction with the archaisms of the law which have been traced to their origin in the course of this opinion. It would be a misfortune if a narrow or grudging process of construction were to exemplify and perpetuate the very evils to be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 342\n, 351]\n\u00a0\n remedied. \n26\n There are times when uncertain words are to be wrought into consistency and unity with a legislative policy which is itself a source of law, a new generative impulse transmitted to the legal system. 'The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed.'27 Its intimation is clear enough in the statutes now before us that their effects shall not be stifled, without the warrant of clear necessity, by the perpetuation of a policy which now has had its day. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n  The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.\n  Reversed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tiffany, Death by Wrongful Act,  3, 611; Pollock, Torts (13th Ed .) pp. 6265.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Baker v.

Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents questions as to the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Railway Labor Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, 44 Stat. 577, as amended by the Act of June 21, 1934, c. 691, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 \nU.S.C.  151- 163 (45 \nU.S.C.A.  151-163), and as to the nature and extent of the relief which courts are authorized by the act to give.\n  Respondents are System Federation No. 40, which will be referred to as the Federation, a labor organization affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and representing shop craft employees of petitioner railway, and certain individuals who are officers and members of the System Federation. They brought the present suit in equity in the District Court for Eastern Virginia, to compel petitioner, an interstate rail carrier, to recognize and treat with respondent Federation, as the duly accredited representative of the mechanical department employees of petitioner, and to restrain petitioner from in any way interfering with, influencing, or coercing its shop craft employees in their free choice of representatives, for the purpose of contracting with petitioner with respect to rules, rates of pay, and working conditions, and for the purpose of considering and settling disputes between petitioner and such employees. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 539]\n\u00a0\n  The history of this controversy goes back to 1922, when, following the failure of a strike by petitioner's shop employees affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, other employees organized a local union known as the 'Mechanical Department Association of the Virginian Railway.' The Association thereupon entered into an agreement with petitioner, providing for rates of pay and working conditions, and for the settlement of disputes with respect to them, but no substantial grievances were ever presented to petitioner by the Association. It maintained its organization and held biennial elections of officers, but the notices of election were sent out by petitioner and all Association expenses were paid by petitioner.\n  In 1927 the American Federation of Labor formed a local organization, which, in 1934, demanded recognition by petitioner of its authority to represent the shop craft employees, and invoked the aid of the National Mediation Board, constituted under the Railway Labor Act, as amended, to establish its authority. The Board, pursuant to agreement between the petitioner, the Federation, and the Association, and in conformity to the statute, held an election by petitioner's shop craft employees to choose representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining with petitioner. As the result of the election, the Board certified that the Federation was the duly accredited representative of petitioner's employees in the six shop crafts.\n  Upon this and other evidence, not now necessary to be detailed, the trial court found that the Federation was the duly authorized representative of the mechanical department employees of petitioner, except the carmen and coach cleaners; that the petitioner, in violation of section 2 of the Railway Labor Act (45 \nU.S.C.A.  151a, 152), had failed to treat with the Federation as the duly accredited representative of petitioner's employees; that petitioner had sought to influence its employees against any affiliation with labor organizations other than an association maintained by petitioner, and to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 540]\n\u00a0\n prevent its employees from exercising their right to choose their own representative; that for that purpose, following the certification, by the National Mediation Board, of the Federation, as the duly authorized representative of petitioner's mechanical department employees, petitioner had organized the Independent Shop Craft Association of its shop craft employees, and had sought to induce its employees to join the independent association, and to put it forward as the authorized representative of petitioner's employees. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n  Upon the basis of these findings, the trial court gave its decree applicable to petitioner's mechanical department employees except the carmen and coach cleaners. It directed petitioner to 'treat with' the Federation and to 'exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules and working conditions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise. * * *' It restrained petitioner from 'entering into any contract, undertaking or agreement of whatsoever kind concerning rules, rates of pay or working conditions affecting its Mechanical Department employees, * * * except * * * with \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 541]\n\u00a0\n the Federation,' and from 'interfering with, influencing or coercing' its employees with respect to their free choice of representatives 'for the purpose of making and maintaining contracts' with petitioner 'relating to rules, rates of pay and working conditions or for the purpose of considering and deciding disputes between the Mechanical Department employees' and petitioner. The decree further restrained the petitioner from organizing or fostering any union of its mechanical department employees for the purpose of interfering with the Federation as the accredited representative of such employees. (D.C.) 11 F.Supp. 621.\n  On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit approved and adopted the findings of the District Court and affirmed its decree. 84 F.(2d) 641. This Court granted certiorari to review the cause as one of public importance. \n299 \nU.S. 529\n.\n  Petitioner here, as below, makes two main contentions: First, with respect to the relief granted, it maintains that section 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act (45 \nU.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), which provides that a carrier shall treat with those certified by the Mediation Board to be the representatives of a craft or class, imposes no legally enforceable obligation upon the carrier to negotiate with the representative so certified, and that in any case the statute imposes no obligation to treat or negotiate which can be appropriately enforced by a court of equity. Second, that section 2, Ninth, in so far as it attempts to regulate labor relations between petitioner and its 'back shop' employees, is not a regulation of interstate commerce authorized by the commerce clause because, as it asserts, they are engaged solely in intrastate activities; and that so far as it imposes on the carrier any obligation to negotiate with a labor union authorized to represent its employees, and restrains it from making agreements with any other labor organization, it is a denial of due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Other minor objections to the decree, so far as relevant to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 542]\n\u00a0\n our decision, will be referred to later in the course of this opinion.\n  The concurrent findings of fact of the two courts below are not shown to be plainly erroneous or unsupported by evidence. We accordingly accept them as the conclusive basis for decision, Texas & N.O.R. O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 558\n. 429; Pick Mfg. Co. v. General Motors Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 3, 4\n, 2, and address ourselves to the questions of law raised on the record.\n  First. The Obligation Imposed by the Statute. By title III of the Transportation Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 469 (45 \nU.S. C.A.  131-146), Congress set up the Railroad Labor Board as a means for the peaceful settlement, by agreement or by arbitration, of labor controversies between interstate carriers and their employees. It sought 'to encourage settlement without strikes, first by conference between the parties, failing that, by reference to adjustment boards of the parties' own choosing and, if this is ineffective, by a full hearing before a national board.' Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72, 79\n, 281. The decisions of the Board were supported by no legal sanctions. The disputants were not 'in any way to be forced into compliance with the statute or with the judgments pronounced by the Labor Board, except through the effect of adverse public opinion.' Pennsylvania Railroad System & Allied Lines Federation v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n267 \nU.S. 203, 216\n, 311.\n  In 1926 Congress, aware of the impotence of the Board, and of the fact that its authority was generally not recognized or respected by the railroads or their employees, made a fresh start toward the peaceful settlement of labor disputes affecting railroads, by the repeal of the 1920 Act and the adoption of the Railway Labor Act (44 Stat. 577). Report, Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, No. 222, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 563\n, 431. By the new measure Congress continued its policy of encouraging the amicable adjustment of labor disputes by their voluntary submis- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 543]\n\u00a0\n sion to arbitration before an impartial board, but it supported that policy by the imposition of legal obligations. It provided means for enforcing the award obtained by arbitration between the parties to labor disputes. Section 9 (45 \nU.S.C.A.  159). In certain circumstances it prohibited any change in conditions, by the parties to an unadjusted labor dispute, for a period of thirty days, except by agreement. Section 10 (45 U.S.C.A.  160). It recognized their right to designate representatives for the purposes of the act 'without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by either party over the self-organization or designation of representatives by the other.' Section 2, Third. 44 Stat. 577. Under the last-mentioned provision this Court held, in the Railway Clerks Case, supra, that employees were free to organize and to make choice of their representatives without the 'coercive interference' and 'pressure' of a company union organized and maintained by the employer; and that the statute protected the freedom of choice of representatives, which was an essential of the statutory scheme, with a legal sanction which it was the duty of courts to enforce by appropriate decree.\n  The prohibition against such interference was continued and made more explicit by the amendment of 1934.2 Petitioner does not challenge that part of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 544]\n\u00a0\n decree which enjoins any interference by it with the free choice of representatives by its employees, and the fostering, in the circumstances of this case, of the company union. That contention is not open to it in view of our decision in the Railway Clerks Case, supra, and of the unambiguous language of section 2, Third, and Fourth, of the act, as amended (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subds. 3, 4).\n  But petitioner insists that the statute affords no legal sanction for so much of the decree as directs petitioner to 'treat with' respondent Federation 'and exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise.' It points out that the requirement for reasonable effort to reach an agreement is couched in the very words of section 2, First (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 1), which were taken from section 301 of the Transportation Act (45 U.S.C.A.  132), and which were held to be without legal sanction in that act. Pennsylvania Railroad System & Allied Lines Federation v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, \n267 \nU.S. 203, 215\n, 310. It is argued that they cannot now be given greater force as reenacted in the Railway Labor Act of 1926, and continued in the 1934 amendment. But these words no longer stand alone and unaided by mandatory provision of the statute as they did when first enacted. The amendment of the Railway Labor Act added new provisions in section 2, Ninth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), which makes it the duty of the Mediation Board, when any dispute arises among the carrier's employees, 'as to who are the representatives of such employees,' to investigate the dispute and to certify, as was done in this case, the name of the organization authorized to represent the employees. It commands that 'upon receipt of such certification the carrier shall treat with the representative so certified as the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act (chapter).' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 545]\n\u00a0\n  It is, we think, not open to doubt that Congress intended that this requirement be mandatory upon the railroad employer, and that its command, in a proper case, be enforced by the courts. The policy of the Transportation Act of encouraging voluntary adjustment of labor disputes, made manifest by those provisions of the act which clearly contemplated the moral force of public opinion as affording its ultimate sanction, was, as we have seen, abandoned by the enactment of the Railway Labor Act. Neither the purposes of the later act, as amended, nor its provisions when read, as they must be, in the light of our decision in the Railway Clerks Case, supra, lend support to the contention that its enactments, which are mandatory in form and capable of enforcement by judicial process, were intended to be without legal sanction. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n  Experience had shown, before the amendment of 1934, that when there was no dispute as to the organizations authorized to represent the employees, and when there was willingness of the employer to meet such representative for a discussion of their grievances, amicable adjustment of differences had generally followed and strikes had been avoided. \n4\n On the other hand, a prolific source of dispute had been the maintenance by the railroads of company unions and the denial by railway management \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 546]\n\u00a0\n of the authority of representatives chosen by their employees. Report of House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, No. 1944, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1-2.5 Section 2, Ninth, of the amended act (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), was specifically aimed at this practice. It provided a means for ascertaining who are the authorized representatives of the employees through intervention \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 547]\n\u00a0\n and certification by the Mediation Board, and commanded the carrier to treat with the representative so certified. That the command was limited in its application to the case of intervention and certification by the Mediation Board indicates not that its words are precatory, but only that Congress hit at the evil 'where experience shows it to be most felt.' Keokee Consol. Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 857.\n  Petitioner argues that the phrase 'treat with' must be taken as the equivalent of 'treat' in its intransitive sense, as meaning 'regard' or 'act towards,' so that compliance with its mandate requires the employer to meet the authorized representative of the employees only if and when he shall elect to negotiate with them. This suggestion disregards the words of the section, and ignores the plain purpose made manifest throughout the numerous provisions of the act. Its major objective is the avoidance of industrial strife, by conference between the authorized representatives of employer and employee. The command to the employer to 'treat with' the authorized representative of the employees adds nothing to the 1926 act, unless it requires some affirmative act on the of the employer. Compare the Railway Clerks Case, supra. As we cannot assume that its addition to the statute was purposeless, we must take its meaning to be that which the words suggest, which alone would add something to the statute as \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 548]\n\u00a0\n it was before amendment, and which alone would tend to effect the purpose of the legislation. The statute does not undertake to compel agreement between the employer and employees, but it does command those preliminary steps without which no agreement can be reached. It at least requires the employer to meet and confer with the authorized representative of its employees, to listen to their complaints, to make reasonable effort to compose differences-in short, to enter into a negotiation for the settlement of labor disputes such as is contemplated by section 2, First ( 45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 1).\n  Petitioner's insistence that the statutes does not warrant so much of the decree as forbids it to enter into contracts of employment with its individual employees is based upon a misconstruction of the decree. Both the statute and the decree are aimed at securing settlement of labor disputes by inducing collective bargaining with the true representative of the employees and by preventing such bargaining with any who do not represent them. The obligation imposed on the employer by section 2, Ninth ( 45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), to treat with the true representative of the employees as designated by the Mediation Board, when read in the light of the declared purposes of the act, and of the provisions of section 2, Third and Fourth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subds. 3, 4), giving to the employees the right to organize and bargain collectively through the representative of their own selection, is exclusive. It imposes the affirmative duty to treat only with the true representative, and hence the negative duty to treat with no other. We think, as the government concedes in its brief,6 that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 549]\n\u00a0\n the injunction against petitioner's entering into any contract concerning rules, rates of pay, and working conditions, except with respondent, is designed only to prevent collective bargaining with any one purporting to represent employees, other than respondent, who has been ascertained to be their true representative. When read in its context, it must be taken to prohibit the negotiation of labor contracts, generally applicable to employees in the mechanical department, with any representative other than respondent, but not as precluding such individual contracts as petitioner may elect to make directly with individual employees. The decree, thus construed, conforms, in both its affirmative and negative aspects, to the requirements of section 2.\n  Propriety of Relief in Equity. Petitioner contends that if the statute is interpreted as requiring the employer to negotiate with the representative of his employees, its obligation is not the appropriate subject of a decree in equity; that negotiation depends on desires and mental attitudes which are beyond judicial control; and that since equity cannot compel the parties to agree, it will not \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 550]\n\u00a0\n compel them to take the preliminary steps which may result in agreement.\n  There is no want of capacity in the court to direct complete performance of the entire obligation; both the negative duties not to maintain a company union and not to negotiate with any representative of the employees other than respondent and the affirmative duty to treat with respondent. Full performance of both is commanded by the decree in terms which leave in no uncertainty the requisites of performance. In compelling compliance with either duty, it does far less than has been done in compelling the discharge of a contractual or statutory obligation calling for a construction or engineering enterprise, New Orleans, Mobile & Texas Ry.

Whether an obligation has been discharged, and whether action taken or omitted is in good faith or reasonable, are everyday subjects of inquiry by courts in framing and enforcing their decrees.\n  It is true that a court of equity may refuse to give any relief when it is apparent that that which it can give will not be effective or of benefit to the plaintiff. Equity will not decree the execution of a partnership agreement since it cannot compel the parties to remain partners, see Hyer v. Richmond Traction Co., \n168 \nU.S. 471, 482\n, or compel one to enter into performance of a contract of personal service which it cannot adequately control, Rutland Marble Co. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 551]\n\u00a0\n v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 358; Karrick v. Hannaman, \n168 \nU.S. 328, 336\n; Tobey v. Bristol, Fed.Cas. No. 14, 065; Weeks v. Pratt (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 53, 57; Railway Labor Act,  2, Tenth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 10). But the extent to which equity will go to give relief where there is no adequate remedy at law is not a matter of fixed rule. It rests rather in the sound discretion of the court. Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557, 565; Joy v. St. Louis, supra, \n138 \nU.S. 1, 47\n; Morrison v. Work, \n266 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 153; Curran v. Holyoke Water Power Co., 116 Mass. 90, 92. Whether the decree will prove so useless as to lead a court to refuse to give it, is a matter of judgment to be exercised with reference to the special circumstances of each case rather than to general rules which at most are but guides to the exercise of discretion. It is a familiar rule that a court may exercise its equity powers, or equivalent mandamus powers, United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352, 359\n, 617, to compel courts, boards, or officers to act in a matter with respect to which they may have jurisdiction or authority, although the court will not assume to control or guide the exercise of their authority, Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States ex rel. Humboldt S.S. Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474\n; United States ex rel. Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638\n; see Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, \n267 \nU.S. 175, 184\n, 255; Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Kadrie, \n281 \nU.S. 206, 218\n, 324.\n  In considering the propriety of the equitable relief granted here, we cannot ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately expressed in legislation, that where the obstruction of the company union is removed, the meeting of employers and employees at the conference table is a powerful aid to industrial peace. Moreover, the resources of the Railway Labor Act are not exhausted if negotiation fails in the first instance to result in agreement. If disputes concerning changes in rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, are 'not adjusted by the parties in conference,' either party may invoke the mediation services of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 552]\n\u00a0\n Mediation Board, section 5, First (45 U.S.C.A.  155, subd. 1), or the parties may agree to seek the benefits of the arbitration provision of section 7 (45 U.S.C.A.  157). With the coercive influence of the company union ended, and in view of the interest of both parties in avoiding a strike, we cannot assume that negotiation, as required by the decree, will not result in agreement, or lead to successful mediation or arbitration, or that the attempt to secure one or another through the relief which the district court gave is not worth the effort.\n  More is involved than the settlement of a private controversy without appreciable consequences to the public. The peaceable settlement of labor controversies, especially where they may seriously impair the ability of an interstate rail carrier to perform its service to the public, is a matter of public concern. That is testified to by the history of the legislation now before us, the reports of committees of Congress having the proposed legislation in charge, and by our common knowledge. Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved. Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 385, 96 A.L.R. 1166; Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 270\n-273, 156, 157; City of Harrisonville W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 603; Beasley v. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co., \n191 \nU.S. 492, 497\n; Joy v. St. Louis, supra, \n138 \nU.S. 1, 47\n; Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Marshall, \n136 \nU.S. 393, 405\n, 406; Conger v. New York, West Shore & Buffalo R. Co., 120 N.Y. 29, 32, 33, 23 N.E. 983. The fact that Congress has indicated its purpose to make negotiation obligatory is in itself a declaration of public interest and policy which should be persuasive in inducing courts to give relief. It is for similar reasons that courts, which traditionally have refused to compel performance of a contract to submit to arbitration, Tobey v. Bristol, supra, enforce statutes commanding performance of arbitration agreements, Red Cross \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 553]\n\u00a0\n Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 119\n, 121, 275, 276; Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, \n284 \nU.S. 263, 278\n, 170.\n  The decree is authorized by the statute and was granted in an appropriate exercise of the equity powers of the court.\n  Second. Constitutionality of section 2 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U. S.C.A.  151a, 152). (A) Validity Under the Commerce Clause. The power of Congress over interstate commerce extends to such regulations of the relations of rail carriers to their employees as are reasonably calculated to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce by strikes and their attendant disorders. Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 347\n, 348, L.R.A.1917E, 938, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1024. The Railway Labor Act ,  2 (45 U.S.C.A.  151a), declares that its purposes, among others, are 'to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein,' and 'to provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.' The provisions of the act and its history, to which reference has been made, establish that such are its purposes, and that the latter is in aid of the former. What has been said indicates clearly that its provisions are aimed at the settlement of industrial disputes by the promotion of collective bargaining between employers and the authorized representative of their employees, and by mediation and arbitration when such bargaining does not result in agreement. It was for Congress to make the choice of the means by which its objective of securing the uninterrupted service of interstate railroads was to be secured, and its judgment, supported as it is by our long experience with industrial disputes, and the history of railroad labor relations, to which we have referred, is not open to review here. \n7\n The means chosen are appro- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 554]\n\u00a0\n priate to the end sought and hence are within the congressional power. See Railway Clerks Case, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 433; Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330, 369\n, 55 S. Ct. 758, 771.\n  But petitioner insists that the act as applied to its 'back shop' employees is not within the commerce power since their duties have no direct relationship to interstate transportation. Of the 824 employees in the six shop crafts eligible to vote for a choice of representatives, 322 work in petitioner's 'back shops' at Princeton, W. Va. They are there engaged in making classified repairs, which consist of heavy repairs\n__________ amendment, there has been but one. See National Mediation Board, First Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1935, p. 8; Second Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1936, p. 1.\n  In the water transportation and motor transportation fields, there were frequent strikes. A table submitted by the United States (see Respondent's Brief, Associated Press v. National Labor Relations Board, No. 365, October Term 1936, p. 57), and derived from United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletins No. R. 339 (1936), p. 4; No. R. 389 (1936), p. 4; Monthly Labor Review (May-September, 1936), Monthly 'Analysis of Strikes,' shows the following:\n       Man-days of idleness due to labor strikes.        1933 1934  1935 (1936  Jan.-May)   Water Transportation  32,752  1,068,867 749,534  119,820   Motor Transportation  155,565  859,657  202,393  46,054   Railroads 0  0  56 0\n  Yet there were many disputes between rail carriers and their employees. Apart from the more trivial grievances and differences of opinion in the interpretation of agreements, 876 disputes, principally over changes in rates of pay, rules or working conditions, were referred to the United States Board of Mediation between 1926 and 1934. The following table, derived from its Eighth Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1934, pp. 4-5, indicates the suc- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 555]\n\u00a0\n on locomotives and cars withdrawn from service for that purpose for long periods (an average of 105 days for locomotives and 109 days for cars). The repair work is\n__________ cess of the mediation and arbitration machinery set up by the Railway Labor Act.\n           Fiscal Year Ending June 30,-    Manner of Disposition 1927 1928  1929 1930  1931 1932   1933  1934 Total\n  Mediation Agreements  57 84 46 25 24 45 23 17  321   Withdrawn by Parties  24 45 43 20 21 69 20 26  268   Arbitration Agreements 27 14 10 4  2  4  3  9  73   Closed Account:   Refusal to Arbitrate 0  0  9  3  1  47 39 50  149   Retired or closed,   other causes  3  2  21 10 5  5  10 9  65\n   But statistics show that many more labor disputes were settled by direct negotiation, supra, footnote 4, and Congress might reasonably have feared that the action of certain railroads in negotiating only with unions dominated by them would prevent such settlements and lead to strikes. See supra, footnote 5. That there were many disputes, apparent and latent, for which the 1926 act had not provided adequate machinery, is shown by the large number of representation disputes (more than 230) referred to the National Mediation Board in the first two years of its existence, see First Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1935, p. 9; Second Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1936, pp. 5, 7.\n  It is the belief of the National Mediation Board that peace in the railroad industry is largely due to the 3,485 collective agreements covering rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, which were filed by June 30, 1936 (see National Mediation Board, Second Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1936, p. 26). In its First Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1935, it concluded (p. 36): 'The absence of strikes in the railroad industry, particularly during the last two years when wide-spread strikes, the usual accompaniment of business recovery, prevailed throughout the country, is to be explained primarily not by the mediation machinery of the Railway Labor Act, but by the existence of these collective labor contracts. For, while they are in existence, these contracts provide orderly, legal processes of settling all disputes as a substitute for strikes and industrial warfare.' \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 556]\n\u00a0\n upon the equipment used by petitioner in its transportation service, 97 per cent. of which is interstate. At times a continuous stream of engines and cars passes through the 'back shops' for such repairs. When not engaged in repair work, the back shop employees perform 'store order work,' the manufacture of material such as rivets and repair parts, to be placed in railroad stores for use at the Princeton shop and other points on the line.\n  The activities in which these employees are engaged have such a relation to the other confessedly interstate activities of the petitioner that they are to be regarded as a part of them. All taken together fall within the power of Congress over interstate commerce. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612, 619\n; cf. Pedersen v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146, 151\n, Ann.Cas.1914C, 153. Both courts below have found that interruption by strikes of the back shop employees, if more than temporary, would seriously cripple petitioner's interstate transportation. The relation of the back shop to transportation is such that a strike of petitioner's employees there, quite apart from the likelihood of its spreading to the operating department, would subject petitioner to the danger, substantial, though possibly indefinable in its extent, of interruption of the transportation service. The cause is not remote from the effect. The relation between than is not tenuous. The effect on commerce cannot be regarded as negligible. See United States v. Railway Employees' Department of American Federation of Labor (D.C.) 290 F. 978, 981, holding participation of back shop employees in the nation-wide railroad shopmen's strike of 1922 to constitute an interference with interstate commerce. As the regulation here in question is shown to be an appropriate means of avoiding that danger, it is within the power of Congress. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 557]\n\u00a0\n  It is no answer, as petitioner suggests, that it could those its back shops and turn over the repair work to independent contractors. Whether the railroad should do its repair work in its own shops, or in those of another, is a question of railroad management. It is petitioner's determination to make its own repairs which has brought its relations with shop employees within the purview of the Railway Labor Act. It is the nature of the work done and its relation to interstate transportation which afford adequate basis for the exercise of the regulatory power of Congress.\n  The Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 \nU.S. 463, 498\n, which mentioned railroad repair shops as a subject beyond the power to regulate commerce, are not controlling here. Whatever else may be said of that pronouncement, it is obvious that the commerce power is as much dependent upon the type of regulation as its subject matter. It is enough for present purposes that experience has shown that the failure to settle, by peaceful means, the grievances of railroad employees with respect to rates of pay, rules or working conditions, is far more likely to hinder interstate commerce than the failure to compensate workers who have suffered injury in the course of their employment.\n  (B) Validity of section 2 of the Railway Labor Act Under the Fifth Amendment. The provisions of the Railway Labor Act applied in this case, as construed by the court below, and as we construe them, do not require petitioner to enter into any agreement with its employees, and they do not prohibit its entering into such contract of employment as it chooses, with its individual employees. They prohibit only such use of the company union as, despite the objections repeated here, was enjoined in the Railway Clerks Case, supra, and they impose on petitioner only the affirmative duty of 'treating with' the authorized representatives of its employees for the purpose of negotiating a labor dispute. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 558]\n\u00a0\n  Even though Congress, in the choice of means to effect a permissible regulation of commerce, must conform to due process, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., supra, \n295 \nU.S. 330, 347\n, 761; Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 80, 97\n, 92; see Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 589\n, 863, 97 A.L.R. 1106, it is evident that where, as here, the means chosen are appropriate to the permissible end, there is little scope for the operation of the due process clause. The railroad can complain only of the infringement of its own constitutional immunity, not that of its employees. Erie R. Co. v. Williams, \n233 \nU.S. 685, 697\n, 51 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1097; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n; Rail & River Coal Co. v. Yaple, \n236 \nU.S. 338, 349\n; cf. Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 \nU.S. 210, 214\n, Ann.Cas.1914D, 637. And the Fifth Amendment, like the Fourteenth, see West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, decided this day, is not a guarantee of untrammeled freedom of action and of contract. In the exercise of its power to regulate commerce, Congress can subject both to restraints not shown to be unreasonable. Such are the restraints of the Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.), Johnson v. Southern Pac. Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1\n; of the act imposing a wage scale on rail carriers (45 U.S.C.A.  65, 66); Wilson v. New, supra; of the Railroad Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq.), Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 38\n L.R.A.(N.S.) 44; of the act fixing maximum hours of service for railroad employees whose duties control or affect the movement of trains (45 U.S.C.A.  61-64), Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra; of the act prohibiting the prepayment of seamen's wages (46 U.S.C.A.  599), Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169\n.\n  Each of the limited duties imposed upon petitioner by the statute and the decree do not differ in their purpose and nature from those imposed under the earlier statute and enforced in the Railway Clerks Case, supra. The quality of the action compelled, its reasonableness, and therefore the lawfulness of the compulsion, must be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 559]\n\u00a0\n judged in the light of the conditions which have occasioned the exercise of governmental power. If the compulsory settlement of some differences, by arbitration, may be within the limits of due process, see Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151\n, it seems plain that the command of the statute to negotiate for the settlement of labor disputes, given in the appropriate exercise of the commerce power, cannot be said to be so arbitrary or unreasonable as to infringe due process.\n  Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 13\n Ann.Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, L.R.A.1915C, 960, have no present application. The provisions of the Railway Labor Act invoked here neither compel the employer to enter into any agreement, nor preclude it from entering into any contract with individual employees. They do not 'interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the carrier to select its employees or to discharge them.' See the Railway Clerks Case, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 571\n, 434.\n  There remains to be considered petitioner's contentions that the certificate of the National Mediation Board is invalid and that the injunction granted is prohibited by the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, of March 23, 1932, c. 90, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.  101-115 (29 U.S.C. A.  101-115).\n  Validity of the Certificate of the National Mediation Board. In each craft of petitioner's mechanical department a majority of those voting cast ballots for the Federation. In the case of the blacksmiths the Federation failed to receive a majority of the ballots of those eligible to vote, although a majority of the craft participated in the election. In the case of the carmen and coach cleaners, a majority of the employees eligible to vote did not participate in the election. There has been no appeal from the ruling of the District Court that the designation of the Federation as the representative of the carmen and coach cleaners was invalid. Petitioner as \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 560]\n\u00a0\n sails the certification of the Federation as the representative of the blacksmiths because less than a majority of that craft, although a majority of those voting, voted for the Federation.\n  Section 2, Fourth, of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 4) provides: 'The majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act (chapter).' Petitioner construes this section as requiring that a representative be selected by the votes of a majority of eligible voters. It is to be noted that the words of the section confer the right of determination upon a majority of those eligible to vote, but is silent as to the manner in which that right shall be exercised. Election laws providing for approval of a proposal by a specified majority of an electorate have been generally construed as a requiring only the consent of the specified majority of those participating in the election. Carroll County v. Smith, \n111 \nU.S. 556, 4\n S. Ct. 539; Douglass v. Pike County, \n101 \nU.S. 677\n; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. County Court of Davidson County, 1 Sneed.( Tenn.) 637, 62 Am.Dec. 424; Montgomery County Fiscal Court v. Trimble, 104 Ky. 629, 47 S.W. 773, 42 L.R.A. 738. Those who do not participate 'are presumed to assent to the expressed will of the majority of those voting.' County of Cass v. Johnston, \n95 \nU.S. 360, 369\n, and see Carroll County v. Smith, supra.\n  We see no reason for supposing that section 2, Fourth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 4), was intended to adopt a different rule. If, in addition to participation by a majority of a craft, a vote of the majority of those eligible is necessary for a choice, an indifferent minority could prevent the resolution of a contest, and thwart the purpose of the act, which is dependent for its operation upon the selection of representatives. There is the added danger that the absence of eligible voters may be due less to their indifference than to coercion by the employer. The opinion of the trial court discloses that the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 561]\n\u00a0\n Mediation Board scheduled an election to be determined by a majority of the eligible voters, but that the Federation's subsequent protest that the Railway was influencing the men not to vote caused the Board to hold a new election to be decided by the ballots of a majority of those voting.\n  It is significant of the congressional intent that the language of section 2, Fourth, was taken from a rule announced by the United States Railroad Labor Board, acting under the labor provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920, Decision No. 119, International Association of Machinists et al. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. et al., 2 Dec.U.S. Railroad Labor Board, 87, 96, par. 15. Prior to the adoption of the Railway Labor Act, this rule was interpreted by the Board, in Decision No. 1971, Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks v. Southern Pacific Lines, 4 Dec.U.S.Railroad Labor Board 625, where it appeared that a majority of the craft participated in the election. The Board ruled, p. 639, that a majority of the votes cast was sufficient to designate a representative. A like interpretation of section 2, Fourth, was sustained in Association of Clerical Employees v. Brother of Railway & S. S. Clerks (C.C.A.) 85 F.(2d) 152.\n  The petitioner also challenges the validity of the certificate of the National Mediation Board in this case because it fails to state the number of eligible voters in each craft or class. The certificate states that respondent 'has been duly designated and authorized to represent the mechanical department employees' of petitioner. It also shows on its face the total number of votes cast in each craft in favor of each candidate, but omits to state the total number of eligible voters in each craft. Petitioner insists that this is a fatal defect in the certificate, upon the basis of those cases which hold that where a finding of fact of an administrative officer or tribunal is prerequisite to the making of a rule or order, the finding must be explicitly \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 562]\n\u00a0\n set out. See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n; United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193\n.\n  The practice contended for is undoubtedly desirable, but it is not required by the present statute or by the authorities upon which petitioner relies. The National Mediation Board makes no order. The command which the decree of the court enforces is that of the statute, not of the Board. Its certificate that the Federation is the authorized representative of the employees is the ultimate finding of fact prerequisite to enforcement by the courts of the command of the statute. There is no contention that this finding is conclusive in the absence of a finding of the basic facts on which it rests-that is to say, the number of eligible voters, the number participating in the election and the choice of the majority of those who participate. Whether the certification, if made as to those facts, is conclusive, it is unnecessary now to determine. But we think it plain that if the Board omits to certify any of them, the omitted fact is open to inquiry by the court asked to enforce the command of the statute. See Dismuke v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 167, 171\n-173, 56 S. Ct. 400, 403, 404. Such inquiry was made by the trial court which found the number of eligible voters and thus established the correctness of the Board's ultimate conclusion. The certificate which conformed to the statutory requirement, was prima facie sufficient, and was not shown to be invalid for want of the requisite supporting facts.\n  Validity of the Injunction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Petitioner assails the decree for its failure to conform to the requirements of section 9 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act (29 U.S.C.A.  109), which provides: 'Every restraining order or injunction granted in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute shall include only a prohibition of such specific act \n\n[300 \nU.S. 515\n, 563]\n\u00a0\n or acts as may be expressly complained of in the bill of complaint or petition filed in such case and as shall be expressly included in * * * findings of fact made and filed by the court.' The evident purpose of this section, as its history and context show, was not to preclude mandatory injunctions, but to forbid blanket injunctions against labor unions, which are usually prohibitory in form, and to confine the injunction to the particular acts complained of and found by the court. We deem it unnecessary to comment on other similar objections, except to say that they are based on strained and unnatural constructions of the words of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and conflict with its declared purpose, section 2 ( 29 U.S.C.A.  102), that the employee 'shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.'\n  It suffices to say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act can affect the present decree only so far as its provisions are found not to conflict with those of section 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 9), authorizing the relief which has been granted. Such provisions cannot be rendered nugatory by the earlier and more general provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. See the Railway Clerks Case, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 571\n, 434; cf. Callahan v.

Federation   \n300 \nU.S. 515\n (1937)   ] \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court found that after the certification by the Mediation Board 'the defendant, by and through its officers, agents and servants, undertook by means of the circulation of a petition or petitions addressed to the National Mediation Board to have the certification of the National Mediation Board aforesaid altered, changed or revoked so as to deprive its Mechanical Department employes of the right to representation by said System Federation No. 40, Railway Employes Department of the American Federation of Labor, so designated as aforesaid, and thereafter did cause to be organized the Independent Shop Crafts Association by individual Mechanical Department employes by circulating or causing to be circulated applications for membership in said Independent Shop Crafts Association notwithstanding the certification as aforesaid by the National Mediation Board of said System Federation No. 40, Railway Employes Department of the American Federation of Labor, as the authorized representative of its Mechanical Department employes, * * *' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 2 of the act, as amended in 1934 (45 U.S.C.A.  151a), declares that its purposes, among others, are '(2) to forbid any limitation upon freedom of association among employees or any denial, as a condition of employment or otherwise, of the right of employees to join a labor organization' and '(3) to provide for the complete independence of carriers and of employees in the matter of self-organization to carry out the purposes of this Act (chapter).' The section was also amended to provide that 'neither party shall in any way interfere with, influence, or coerce the other in its choice of representatives,' section 2, Third (45 U. S.C.A.  152, subd. 3), and that 'it shall be unlawful for any carrier to interfere in any way with the organization of its employees, or to use the funds of the carrier in maintaining or assisting or contributing to any labor organization * * * or to influence or coerce employees in an effort to induce them to join or remain or not to join or remain members of any labor organization,' section 2, Fourth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 4). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The 1934 amendment imposed various other obligations upon the carrier, to which criminal penalties were attached (section 2, Tenth (45 U. S.C.A.  152, subd. 10)) e.g., prohibitions against helping unions, by contributions of funds, or assistance in the collection of dues, section 2, Fourth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 4); against requiring employees to promise to join or not to join a labor union, section 2, Fifth (45 U.S.C.A .  152, subd. 5); against changing rates of pay, etc., without specifying a conference upon thirty days' notice, section 2, Seventh (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 7); and see the requirement that the carrier post notices that all disputes will be determined in accordance with the act, section 2, Eighth (45 U.S.C.A.  152, subd. 8).  \n[\nFootnote 4\n] In the first two years after the enactment of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 363 cases concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions were submitted to the United States Board of Mediation, and about 25 per cent. of these were withdrawn by the parties. Yet, during the same period, more than 600 direct and voluntary settlements were negotiated. See United States Board of Mediation, First Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1927, pp. 10, 11; Second Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1928, pp. 11, 58, 59. Compare National Mediation Board, Second Annual Report, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1936, at p. 1: 'For every dispute submitted to * * * these Boards, there were many others considered and settled in conferences between representatives of carriers and of the employees as required by section 2, second, of the Act.' \n  See, also, testimony of William M. Leiserson, Chairman of the National Mediation Board until February 1, 1937, at Hearing by National Labor Relations Board in the case of Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n (No. 419, October Term, 1936): 'If we have a threat of a strike now (on the railroads) it might be on a big fundamental question, like wages and hours, and we usually find we can settle those by arbitration or otherwise. * * * But if the issues involved were discrimination or discharge of men because they had joined the organization, or the question would be the right of the organization to represent them, we could not have settled those strikes.'

No. 1, August, 1936, pp. 1718.  \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See, also, statement by Representative Crosser, in charge of the bill on the floor, in Hearings, House Committee on Rules, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., on H.R. 9861, pp. 1011, 13: 'The purpose of the bill is * * * ( inter alia) to outlaw the attempt that has been made in numerous instances by employers who control alleged labor unions, and thereby to use a slang phrase, to 'gum up the works'. * * * We have had 8 years of operation of this act, and we have prevented any strikes. But strikes have been threatened because of the defects which have been found in this bill.'\n  Under the 1926 act disputes over the designation of employee representatives could be dealt with by the old United States Mediation Board only by agreement of the parties. The carriers agreed to an election conducted by the Board but nine times in six years, see testimony of William M. Leiserson, Chairman of National Mediation Board until February 1, 1937, at Hearing by National Labor Relations Board in the case of Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. (No. 419, October Term, 1936); Governmental Protection of Labor's Right to Organize, National Labor Relations Board, Division of Economic Research, Bull. No. 1, August, 1936, p. 50. The 1934 amendment was followed by a large increase in the number of representation disputes submitted to the National Mediation Board. See infra, Note 7. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] (Note 35a.) 'The Government interprets the negative obligations imposed by the statute and decree as having the following effect:\n'When the majority of a craft or class has (either by secret ballot or otherwise) selected a representative, the carrier cannot make with anyone other than the representative a collective contract (i.e., a contract which sets rates of pay, rules, or working conditions), whether the contract covers the class as a whole or a part thereof. Neither the statute nor the decree prevents the carrier from refusing to make a collective contract and hiring individuals on whatever terms the carrier may by unilateral action determine. In hirings of that sort the individual does not deal in a representative capacity with the carrier and the hiring does not set general rates of pay, rules, or working conditions. Of course, as a matter of voluntary action, not as a result of the statute or the decree, the carrier may contract with the duly designated representative to hire individuals only on the terms of a collective understanding between the carrier and the representative; but any such agreement would be entirely voluntary on the carrier's part and would in no sense be compelled.\n\n'If the majority of a craft or class has not selected a representative, the carrier is free to make with anyone it pleases and for any group it pleases contracts establishing rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] There was evidence available to Congress that the labor policy embodied in the Railway Labor Act had been successful in curbing strikes. In the eight years subsequent to the passage of the 1926 act, there were only two small railroad strikes. Since the 1934 \n\n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nW. P. BROWN & SONS LUMBER CO. v. LOUISVILLE & N.R. CO.(1937)\nNo. 100\nArgued: December 8, 1936Decided: January 4, 1937\n\n\n\n\n[299 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. V. Norman, of Louisville, Ky., for petitioners.\n Mr. Elmer A. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n W. P. Brown & Sons Lumber Company and other shippers brought in the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint under section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  16), seeking reparation for alleged overcharges on shipments of lumber and other forest products taking lumber rates. They were awarded damages in the proceedings known as Wausau Southern Lumber Co. v. Alabama Great Southern R.R. Co., 142 I.C.C. 521; Id ., 182 I.C.C. 731. The Louisville & Nashville Railroad and some other carriers refused to comply with the order. Then this suit was brought in the federal court for Western Kentucky to recover the amounts awarded against them. The case was heard on demurrers to the amended petition and to certain paragraphs of the amended answer. The demurrer to the petition was sustained, and that to the answer overruled, on the ground that the award was founded upon an erroneous construction of the so-called 'Jones' or 'Combination Rule' in the tariffs. The parties declining to plead further, judgment was entered dismissing the petition (D.C.) 7 F.Supp. 593. \n\n[299 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals 82 F.(2d) 94. We granted certiorari (\n299 \nU.S. 524\n, 57 S.Ct. 14, 81 L.Ed. --) because of conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Domestic Hardwoods, Inc., 62 App. D.C. 142, 65 F.(2d) 488.\n The shipments involved were from points in the South and Southwest to points North. For such shipments, there have long been commonly available over connecting lines more than one, and often many, through routes from each point of origin to destination. The Interstate Commerce Act does not require that the rates on all routes shall be the same. Nor does it require that there be on each route a joint through rate. Sometimes, none of the tariffs for the several available routes specifies a joint through rate. Where no joint rate is specified, the tariffs for the through routes commonly provide that the through rate shall be the sum of the local rates of the several carriers contributing to the movement. \n1\n In 1918, the Director General of Railroads made, by General Order No. 28, a percentage increase of lumber rates in southern territory, limited to 5 cents per 100 pounds. Thus, a joint through rate could not be increased more than 5 cents. But when the lumber moved on a combination through rate, the 5-cent limit was applied to each factor in the combination. The result was that on combination through routes the increase was often doubled, or tripled. To avoid such a result, the so-called 'Jones' \n\n[299 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n or 'Combination Rule' was devised in February, 1919. Ever since, it has been commonly incorporated in tariffs. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The question for decision is whether the 'Combination Rule' applies to the shipments here involved. If it does not, there is no cause of action. If it does, the award was correct. The rule provides:\n'Where no published through rates are in effect from point of origin to destination on Lumber ..., carloads, and two or more commodity rate factors ... are used in arriving at the through rate for a continuous rail shipment thereof, such through rate will be arrived at in the following manner. ...' (Then follows a formula.)\n\n When applied to the combination rate specified in the tariff, the formula effects a reduction thereof. While the combination rate itself is ordinarily, if not always, higher than the joint through rate, the effect of applying to it the Combination Rule would not necessarily produce equality in rates on the several routes. It might make the combination through rate lower than the published joint through rate. This is true as to many of the shipments here involved. The amended answer gave an example: Laurel, Miss., is a typical lumber shipping point; and Columbus, Ohio, a typical destination. The published through joint rate from Laurel to Columbus, applying via each of the several originating carriers at that point, was 43 cents per 100 pounds. A combination \n\n[299 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n rate for the movement over other routes, unaffected by the Combination Rule, was 43 1\/2 cents. If the combination rate were subjected to the Combination Rule, the rate over the combination route would be 40 1\/2 cents. Thus the combination rate would be much less than the published joint through rate.\n Each of these shipments here involved might have been made over a route for which a joint through rate from point of origin to destination had been published. Instead, the shipment was made over a route for which the rate specified in the tariff was a combination rate. In some instances the route had been designated by the shipper. \n3\n The carriers exacted the full combination rate. The shippers made reclamation, on the ground that the Combination Rule applies in every case where no joint through rate has been published over the route selected for the movement. The commission sustained the shippers' claim.\n First. The rule declares that the prescribed formula is to be applied 'where no published through rates are in effect from point of origin to destination.' The language used is not technical. The meaning of the words is clear. There is no ambiguity. The construction of these railroad tariffs presents, therefore, a question of law, not differing in character from those presented when the construction of any other document is in dispute. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 42 S.Ct. 477, 479. As, in each instance, there was available some through route from point of origin to destination for \n\n[299 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n which joint through rates had been published, the rule, by its terms, has no application. We so hold despite the construction given to the rule by the commission.\n Second. The shippers contend that the construction given to the rule by the commission is conclusive, because preliminary resort to the commission was necessary. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., Ltd., \n234 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S.Ct. 885; Loomis v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 43\n, 36 S.Ct. 228; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Solum, \n247 \nU.S. 477\n, 38 S.Ct. 550. They argue that such preliminary resort was necessary, since the interpretation and application of the rule involved (a) the exercise of sound administrative discretion as to technical and intricate matters of tariff application and the relation of tariffs one to another; (b) the reasonableness of a practice of routing as between higher and lower-rated routes; and (c) uniformity in the application of rates, which is the paramount purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act. But the argument is not sound. To determine whether the rule was applicable to the several shipments does not call for, or indeed permit, the consideration of any of these matters. The simple question for decision, as to each shipment, is whether there existed 'published through rates' 'in effect from point of origin to destination.' The determination of that question requires ordinarily merely the examination of the tariffs. \n4\n The inquiry would, in all respects, be like that commonly made by courts when called upon to construe and apply any other document. This is not a case like Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235, 238\n, 239 S., 51 S.Ct. 429, 430, where there was required 'consideration of matters of fact and the application of expert knowledge for the ascertainment of the technical meaning of the words and a correct \n\n[299 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n appreciation of a variety of incidents affecting their use.' Here, the shippers might have brought their action at law without resort to the commission.\n Third. The shippers urge that the carriers are estopped from contesting the interpretation given by the commission to the Combination Rule, because in Cancellation Rule for Constructing Combination Rates on Lumber, etc., 81 I.C.C. 745, decided by Division 3 in August, 1923, and affirmed on reargument before the full commission December 2, 1924, in 93 I.C.C. 614, the carriers vainly sought to have the rule modified so as to overcome the construction given by the commission. The denial of their application left them remediless by administrative action; but that action in no way prejudiced their right to insist in the courts upon the construction of the rule for which they had contended.\n Fourth. The shippers urge that the interpretation given by the commission should be followed by the Court, because it embodies the settled administrative construction acquiesced in by carriers and shippers. It is true that the commission has repeatedly declared its adherence to the construction for which the shippers contend. Many carriers acquiesced in that construction, in part possibly, because they preferred to take the lesser amount rather than risk losing the traffic. But the cases cited show that other carriers protested vigorously; and their protests have been persistent. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[299 U.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. The shippers urge, in support of the commission's construction, that if application of the Combination Rule is denied, many existing routes, although remaining legally open, will be commercially closed ( compare Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 661\n, 47 S.Ct. 222, 223), because the combination rates, if not reduced by the Combination Rule, would be prohibitively high. Such considerations have no place here, where the sole question for decision is whether there exists a joint through rate over some route between the point of origin and destination. If the route to which alone the joint through rate applies is deemed inadequate, there is ample power in the commission to establish by proceedings under paragraph 3 of section 15 of the act (49 U. S.C.A.  15(3) other through routes with joint rates. \n6\n Likewise, if the rates on the combination routes are deemed excessive, or discriminatory, there is ample power in the commission, under other provisions of the act, to reduce the rates.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 6(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C.A.  6(1) provides: 'If no joint rate over the through route has been established, the several (connecting) carriers in such through route shall file, print and keep open to public inspection as aforesaid, the separately established rates, fares and charges applied to the through transportation.' Concerning through rates, see St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 139\n, 140 S., note 2, 38 S.Ct. 49. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] B. T. Jones' Tariff 228, I.C.C.U.S. 1,  4. In Wausau Southern Lumber Co. v. Alabama Great Southern R.R. Co., 142 I.C.C. 521, 524, the commission states: 'The combination rule was originally published by the director general about seven months after the issuance of General Order No. 28, as an emergency tariff provision to avoid a double increase on certain commodities moving on combination rates, the separate factors of which had been increased by specific amounts. Shortly after the general increase of 1920 the rule was amended substantially to reflect the increases then authorized. It was subsequently further amended to reflect the general reduction of 1922, and is still in effect.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In some instances the claim rests upon a charge of misrouting. That is, the route not having been designated by the shipper, it was the duty of the initial carrier to select the route over which the rate was lowest. Compare Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Solum, \n247 \nU.S. 477, 482\n, 38 S.Ct. 550. The carrier did not fail in that duty unless the Combination Rule applied. That is, there was no misrouting if the commission's construction was erroneous. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Hohenberg v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 46 F.( 2d) 952, 955; Wheelock v.

NATIONAL LABOR(1937)\nNo. 469\nArgued: February 10, 1937Decided: April 12, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. William J. Hughes, Jr., Robert E. Lynch, and Wm. E. Leahy, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[301 \nU.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the petitioner, an operator of motorbusses for the transportation of passengers and express for hire between points in the District of Columbia and in the state of Virginia, challenges the enforcement of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.) against it as in contravention of the commerce clause (art. 1,  8) and the Fifth and Seventh Amendments of the Constitution.\n Pursuant to a written charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board by Local No. 1079 of the Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, a labor organization, the Board issued a complaint alleging that the petitioner had discharged and refused to reinstate certain drivers and garage workmen because of their membership and activity in Local No. 1079 and that this constituted engaging in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the intent of section 8, subsections (1) and (3), and section 2, subsections (6) and (7) of the National Labor Relations Act. \n1\n The petitioner appeared specially and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on constitutional grounds, and, without waiving its objections to the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n Board's jurisdiction, filed an answer substantially admitting the allegations of the complaint with respect to the interstate character of its business, admitting the discharge and refusal to reinstate the employees mentioned in the complaint, and alleging that its action was motivated by the employees' inefficiency and not affected by their membership or activity in the union. The Board overruled the objections to its jurisdiction, fully heard the case, received evidence offered by both parties, and at the conclusion of the hearing denied a motion to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the evidence did not support the allegations of the complaint, except as to three of the twenty-one employees concerned as to whom the complaint was dismissed for lack of evidence. The Board rendered a decision setting forth its findings of fact and entered an order prohibiting the petitioner from discrimination against its employees based upon membership in a union or advocacy of collective bargaining and requiring the petitioner to restore eighteen of the discharged employees to their former positions with compensation for loss due to their discharge and to post notices to the effect that it would comply with the Board's order. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Because of noncompliance with the order the Board filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Appeals for its enforcement. That court refused to disturb the findings of fact made by the Board, overruled the contentions as to unconstitutionality of the act as applied to petitioner and passed a decree en-enforcing the order. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n While the petitioner, in its specifications of error, attacks the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the act as applied does not violate the Fifth and Seventh \n\n[301 \nU.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n Amendments, the argument in brief and at the bar was confined to two propositions: first, that the act is an attempt on the part of Congress to regulate labor relations in all employments whether interstate or intrastate and as it is void as an attempted regulation of intrastate commerce the whole must fall because its provisions are inseverable; secondly, that the evidence does not sustain the findings and the Board committed substantial error in the exclusion of evidence.\n First. No contention is made that the petitioner is other than an instrumentality of interstate commerce. It is engaged in interstate transportation for hire. Our decisions in Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, and Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, put beyond debate the validity of the statute as applied to the petitioner. The contention that the act on its face seeks to regulate labor relations in all employments, whether in interstate commerce or not, is plainly untenable. As we have had occasion to point out in decisions rendered this day, the act limits the jurisdiction of the Board to instances which fall within the commerce power and, if the Board should exceed the jurisdiction conferred upon it, any party aggrieved is at liberty to challenge its action.\n Second. The petition for certiorari made no mention of any claim with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings. In the light of this fact the question is not open for decision here. \n4\n But, were this not so, we should not review the facts, since section 10(e) of the act (29 U.S.C.A.  160(e) provides that 'the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclu- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n sive,' and there was substantial evidence to support the findings.\n This is not a case of alleged confiscation,5 nor is it one where the Board lacked jurisdiction,6 for admittedly the petitioner's activities are in interstate commerce. The complaint is merely of error in appreciating and weighing evidence. In the case of statutory provisions like section 10( e), applicable to other administrative tribunals, we have refused to review the evidence or weigh the testimony and have declared we will reverse or modify the findings only if clearly improper or not supported by substantial evidence. 7 The contentions respecting the rejection of evidence are not well founded.\n Third. The specifications of error addressed to other questions are answered by the decision of this court in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, U.S.C.Supp. I, tit. 29,  151 et seq.

Rummel, of Charleston, W.Va., for respondents.\n\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals has decided that a District Court is without power to set aside its order dismissing a petition for reorganization under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended (11 \nU.S. C.A.  207), and to rehear the cause after the ex- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 133]\n\u00a0\n piration of the period allowed by the Act for appeal from the order. \n1\n To resolve a conflict of decision2 we granted certiorari. \n229 \nU.S. 528, 57\n S. Ct. 41.\n  November 25, 1935, the petitioner filed in the District Court for Southern West Virginia a petition and, on December 10th, an amended and supplemental petition for corporate reorganization under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended. \n3\n February 7, 1936, the respondents filed objections and motions to dismiss. March 2d the petitions were dismissed. March 20th the petitioner presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition for appeal, pursuant to section 24(b) of the Bankruptcy Act. \n4\n April 15th the court denied the appeal,5 holding that the petitioner should have proceeded under section 25(a).6 April 17th petitioner notified respondents that on April 24th it would present a petition to the District Court praying vacation of the order of March 2d and a rehearing and review of all matters arising in the proceedings because of errors committed by the court in dismissing its petitions, and that, upon rehearing, the court would be asked to enter an order approving the original and amended petitions. After presentation of the petition for rehearing and argument thereon the court directed \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 134]\n\u00a0\n that it be filed, took the matter under advisement, and, on May 12th, set aside the order of March 2d, granted a rehearing and review and fixed May 22d for a hearing on all questions arising on the record. The court found that good cause existed justifying vacation of its previous order and reconsideration of the cause. It further found that the application had been seasonably presented and no rights had vested under the order of March 2d which would be disturbed by setting the order aside. By leave of court the petitioner, on May 22d, presented a second amended and supplemental petition, which incorporated the earlier petitions for reorganization, and asked the court to find that the original and supplemental petitions were filed in good faith and complied with section 77B. The respondents objected. May 28th the court, after a hearing, sustained the respondents' objections and dismissed the petitions for reasons set forth in findings of fact and conclusions of law. June 11th petitioner's application to the judge of the District Court, under section 25(a) of the act, for an appeal, with supersedeas, was granted. The Circuit Court of Appeals, on respondents' motion, dismissed the appeal.\n  1. The respondents have moved to dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that the controversy has become moot. In support of the motion they show that for some time prior to the institution of the 77B proceedings the debtor's property had been in possession of a receiver appointed by a state court; that the trustee of a first mortgage had intervened in the receivership proceeding and sought foreclosure; that the state court had ordered a sale of all the debtor's property and the decree of sale had become final before the presentation of the petition for reorganization. They show that subsequent to the order of March 2d dismissing the petition for reorganization further action by the state court resulted in the confirmation of a commissioner's sale, payment of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 135]\n\u00a0\n the purchase price partly in cash and partly in first mortgage bonds of the debtor and execution and delivery of a deed to the purchaser, a nominee of respondents. It appears not only that the respondents were parties to the 77B proceeding but that, prior to the consummation of the sale, the state court was fully advised of the steps taken in the federal courts and of the pendency of the petition for certiorari in this court to review the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing the appeal.\n  The respondents went forward with the proceedings in the state court, looking to a sale of the debtor's property, with full knowledge that a rehearing might be granted and that the order entered thereon might be appealed. They are not entitled, therefore, to rely on any status acquired in the state court suit as precluding further consideration of the petition for reorganization. The motion must accordingly be overruled.\n  2. The petitioner asserts that the grant or refusal of a rehearing rested in the sound discretion of the District Court and since in the proper exercise of that discretion the court entertained the application and reheard the case upon the merits, its action again dismissing the petition for reorganization was a final order and the appeal therefrom was timely. The respondents contend that the first order of dismissal having terminated the cause, and the thirty days allowed by the bankruptcy act for appeal from the order having expired, the District Court was without power to entertain a petition for rehearing and its second order of dismissal was a nullity. Wherefore they say the appeal taken more than thirty days from the date of the original order of March 2, 1936, if considered as challenging that order, was out of time, and the motion to dismiss was properly granted by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We hold the petitioner's position is sound and the appeal should have been entertained. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 136]\n\u00a0\n  Though a court of bankruptcy sits continuously and has no terms,7 respondents urge that, as courts of bankruptcy are courts of equity, the rules applicable to the rehearing of a suit in equity should be applied in bankruptcy cases, and as it appears the term of the District Court expired April 20, 1936, the court had lost its power to disturb the order of March 2d. A court of equity may grant a rehearing, and vacate, alter, or amend its decree, after an appeal has been perfected and after the time for appeal has expired, but not after expiration of the term at which the decree was entered. \n8\n It is true the bankruptcy court applies the doctrines of equity, but the fact that such a court has no terms, and sits continuously, renders inapplicable the rules with respect to the want of power in a court of equity to vacate a decree after the term at which it was entered has ended.\n  In the alternative the respondents argue that where, as here, an adjudication is refused, and the case is retired from the docket, the requirement that an appeal shall be perfected within thirty days from the order of dismissal deprives the court of power to reinstate and rehear the cause after the expiration of the time limited for appeal. They insist that the act contemplates the speedy disposition of causes in bankruptcy and therefore fixes a brief period for appealing from orders therein. To permit the court to rehear a cause after the time for appeal has expired, and to enter a fresh order which is appealable, would, they urge, tend unduly to extend the proceedings, create uncertainty as to the rights of the debtor and creditors, and ignore the intent of Congress. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 137]\n\u00a0\n But we think the court has the power, for good reason, to revise its judgments upon seasonable application and before rights have vested on the faith of its action. Courts of law and equity have such power, limited by the expiration of the term at which the judgment or decree was entered and not by the period allowed for appeal or by the fact that an appeal has been perfected. \n9\n There is no controlling reason for denying a similar power to a court of bankruptcy or for limiting its exercise to the period allowed for appeal. The granting of a rehearing is within the court's sound discretion, and a refusal to entertain a motion therefor, or the refusal of the motion, if entertained, is not the subject of appeal. \n10\n A defeated party who applies for a rehearing and does not appeal from the judgment or decree within the time limited for so doing, takes the risk that he may lose his right of appeal, as the application for rehearing, if the court refuse to entertain it, does not extend the time for appeal. \n11\n Where it appears that a rehearing has been granted only for that purpose the appeal must be dismissed. \n12\n The court below evidently thought the case fell within this class. On the contrary, the rule which governs the case is that the bankruptcy court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, if no intervening rights will be prejudiced by its action, may grant a rehearing upon application diligently made and rehear the case upon the merits; and even though it reaffirm its former action and \n\n[300 \nU.S. 131\n, 138]\n\u00a0\n refuse to enter a decree different from the original one, the order entered upon rehearing is appealable and the time for appeal runs from its entry. \n13\n The District Court's action conformed to these conditions. Two days after the Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for allowance of appeal from the original order of March 2, 1936, petitioner notified respondents of its intention to apply for rehearing. Prompt application was made and the cause was promptly heard. A supplemental petition was presented and entered upon the files by leave of court. The original, the amended, and the supplemental petition were considered upon the merits, and the court made findings and announced conclusions of law with respect thereto. There is no indication that the petition for rehearing was not made in good faith or that the court received it for the purpose of extending petitioner's time for appeal. The court found that no rights had intervened which would render it inequitable to reconsider the merits. There was no abuse of sound discretion in granting the motion and reconsidering the cause.\n  The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n  Reversed.  \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 84 F.(2d) 965.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See West v.

OBISPO OIL CO.(1937)\nNo. 602\nArgued: Decided: April 26, 1937\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph D. Peeler, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, laid upon corporations, in addition to the income tax, a war profits and excess profits tax at very high rates. Because the profits tax might prove unduly burdensome, Congress provided by sections 327 and 328 for a special assessment of the profits tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under certain circumstances. The question for decision in this case is whether, when a special assessment has been made of the profits tax, a court may entertain an action for refund of an amount paid on the accompanying income tax on the ground that the income was erroneously determined.\n Obispo Oil Company brought, in the federal court for Southern California, this action to recover an amount alleged to have been illegally exacted as income tax for the year 1920. Upon final assessment, the Commissioner had assessed its net income for that year at $1,476,330. 52. Under section 236(b), it was necessary to deduct the profits tax and other amounts from the net income in order to determine the amount of the taxable net income. Because the net income of that year included large funds theretofore long in litigation, the Commissioner made a \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n special assessment under section 327(d) to determine the profits tax. \n1\n Where a special assessment is made, section 328 commands that 'the tax shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to the net income of the taxpayer ... for the taxable year, as the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business, bears to their average net income ... for such year.' The Commissioner fixed that ratio as 9.67 per cent.; and, applying it to the Obispo Company's net income of $1,476,330.52, computed the profits tax at $142,765.73. When this and other allowable sums were deducted, the taxable net income was found to be $1,245,430.63.\n The statutory tax rate on net income being 10 per cent., the income tax was determined to be $124,543.06. The Company paid the income tax so assessed; filed then a claim for refund thereof, setting up several grounds of recovery; and, the refund being refused, brought this suit against the Collector of Internal Revenue for the Sixth Collection District of California for alleged overpayment. The amended complaint alleged that the sum had been 'illegally exacted from the plaintiff on account of additional income and profits taxes for the year 1920.' In a trial held in 1931, the District Court held that the company was entitled to recover the full amount claimed. 48 F.(2d) 872. The Collector appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals; but before the appeal was determined there, the case was, upon agreement of the parties, referred back to the District Court for correction, to accord with our decision in North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, \n286 \nU.S. 417\n, 52 S.Ct. 613, which had meanwhile been rendered. Then the Collector moved in the District Court for judgment, claiming that the Com- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n pany was not entitled to recover any part of the sum sued for; and, specifically, that the court had 'no jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action, the tax sought to be recovered having been assessed under the special assessment provisions of sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 (40 Stat. 1093; 42 Stat. 275).'\n The District Court overruled the Collector's motion to dismiss; ruled that the net income as determined by the Commissioner was excessive in the net amount of $40,102.44; and entered judgment for the Company in the sum of $4,010.24 with interest and costs. The Company appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, claiming chiefly that the 1920 net income should have been reduced by an additional depletion allowance of $516,598.10. The Collector filed a cross-appeal, claiming, among other things, that the District Court was without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, 'the tax sought to be recovered having been determined and assessed by the Commissioner ... under the special assessment provisions of Sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court in holding that it had jurisdiction of the subject-matter; but reversed the judgment on the ground that the assessment had overstated the net income by the net amount of $556,700.54, so that there should have been deducted the sum of $516, 598.10 for depletion, in addition to the sum found by the District Court. 85 F.(2d) 860. Certiorari was granted upon petition of the Collector (\n300 \nU.S. 647\n, 57 S.Ct. 435, 81 L.Ed. --) because of the practical importance of the question of jurisdiction presented. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Commissioner's action in applying or rejecting the procedure of sections 327 and 328, and his computation of the \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n profits tax thereunder and of the regular income tax are reviewable by the Board of Tax Appeals. When no special assessment has been made of the profits tax, an action will lie to recover an amount erroneously exacted either for income or for profits taxes. But no court has power to review the grant or denial of a special assessment or the correctness of the computation made thereon. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S.Ct. 587; Heiner v. Diamond Alkali Co., \n288 \nU.S. 502\n, 53 S.Ct. 413. The Company concedes that the amount of the profits taxes, being the subject of a special assessment under sections 327 and 328, could not be reviewed by the court; but it insists that recovery may be had of the sum alleged to have been erroneously exacted for income tax.\n In Heiner v. Diamond Alkali Co., \n288 \nU.S. 502, 503\n, 53 S.Ct. 413, where a special assessment had been made of profits taxes under sections 327 and 328, the taxpayer sued to recover a part of the profits tax, alleging error in the determination of the net income on which it was based. The Circuit Court of Appeals allowed recovery. 60 F.(2d) 505, 513, 514. We reversed its judgment, holding that the court may not, in an action for a refund of profits tax, recalculate the taxpayer's net income and recompute the profits tax by applying to the corrected net income the ratio fixed by the Commissioner for the computation of the tax. We did not pass upon the question whether the same rule should be applied if the taxpayer seeks a refund of the income tax because of an alleged error in the computation of the net income. But the reasoning of the opinion leads to that conclusion.\n The Company insists that, as it would, in view of the large deductions allowed by the Court of Appeals, be entitled to a substantial refund even if it were denied the deduction of the whole of the profits tax from the net income, Congress could not have intended that the deduc- \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n tion provision should deprive the courts of jurisdiction to correct errors in determining the amount of the income from which the income tax is computed; that Congress intended to benefit the taxpayer when it directed that before computing the 10 per cent. income tax the net income found should be reduced by deducting the profits tax therefrom; and that, therefore, it is unreasonable to adopt a construction of the law under which the allowance of the profits tax credit would be considered as so essential an element in the computation of the tax that the taxpayer would be deprived of all other adjustments in the event there is uncertainty as to the particular items.\n By the statute the amount of the income tax payable is dependent upon the amount of the profits tax; and the amount of the profits tax is dependent upon the amount of the income. In order to determine the corporate income tax payable at the statutory rate of 10 per cent., of the taxable net income, there must first be deducted from the net income the amount of the profits tax. Section 236(b). Thus, to compute the income tax in the case at bar, it was necessary first to deduct from the net income ascertained as being $1,476,330.52, the profits tax which by applying, under section 328(a), the ratio of 9.67 per cent. to the net income, was determined to be $142,765.73.\n A change in the amount of net income to which the rate was applied would, of course, produce a change in the amount of the profits tax. Indeed, a different computation of net income might have made it proper to compare the taxpayer with a wholly different group of representative corporations, and hence might have resulted in the determination of a different rate for the profits tax. And moreover, the Commissioner, having authority, in his discretion, to determine whether there should be a special assessment, might have refused to make one. It is no less \n\n[301 \nU.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n true in the present situation than in Heiner v. Diamond Alkali Co., supra, \n288 \nU.S. 502, 506\n, 53 S.Ct. 413, 414, that the taxpayer's true net income is an essential factor in the determination of his liability under sections 327 and 328; and it follows that the making of the special assessment precludes review by a court of the income tax determined.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The amended complaint alleged that sections 327 and 328 were applied 'due to the abnormality resulting from the inclusion in plaintiff's income for that year (1920) of said impounded funds.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The question was present in United States v.

There is hereby created a commission to be known as the 'Industrial Welfare Commission' for the State of Washington, to establish such standards of wages and conditions of labor for women and minors employed within the State of Washington, as shall be held hereunder to be reasonable and not detrimental to health and morals, and which shall be sufficient for the decent maintenance of women.'\n\n  Further provisions required the commission to ascertain the wages and conditions of labor of women and minors within the state. Public hearings were to be held. If after investigation the commission found that in any occupation, trade, or industry the wages paid to women were 'inadequate to supply them necessary cost of living and to maintain the workers in health,' the commission was empowered to call a conference of representatives of employers and employees together with disinterested persons representing the public. The conference was to recommend to the commission, on its request, an estimate of a minimum wage adequate for the purpose above stated, and on the approval of such a recommendation it became the duty of the commission to issue an obligatory order fixing minimum wages. Any such order might be reopened and the question reconsidered with the aid of the former conference or a new one. Special licenses were authorized for the employment of women who were 'physically defective or crippled by age or otherwise,' and also for apprentices, at less than the prescribed minimum wage.\n  By a later act the Industrial Welfare Commission was abolished and its duties were assigned to the Industrial Welfare Committee consisting of the Director of Labor and Industries, the Supervisor of Industrial Insurance, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 388]\n\u00a0\n the Supervisor of Industrial Relations, theIndustrial Statistician, and the Supervisor of Women in Industry. Laws 1921 (Washington) c. 7, p. 12, Remington's Rev.Stat.(1932)  10840, 10893.\n  The appellant conducts a hotel. The appellee Elsie Parrish was employed as a chambermaid and (with her husband) brought this suit to recover the difference between the wages paid her and the minimum wage fixed pursuant to the state law. The minimum wage was $14.50 per week of 48 hours. The appellant challenged the act as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of the state, reversing the trial court, sustained the statute and directed judgment for the plaintiffs. Parrish v. West Coast Hotel Co., 185 Wash. 581, 55 P.(2d) 1083. The case is here on appeal.\n  The appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 24\n A.L.R. 1238, which held invalid the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act (40 Stat. 960) which was attacked under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. On the argument at bar, counsel for the appellees attempted to distinguish the Adkins Case upon the ground that the appellee was employed in a hotel and that the business of an innkeeper was affected with a public interest. That effort at distinction is obviously futile, as it appears that in one of the cases ruled by the Adkins opinion the employee was a woman employed as an elevator operator in a hotel. Adkins v. Lyons, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at page 542, 395, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n  The recent case of Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587, 103\n A.L.R. 1445, came here on certiorari to the New York court which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid. A minority of this Court thought that the New York statute was distinguishable in a material feature from that involved in the Adkins Case and that for that and other reasons the New \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 389]\n\u00a0\n York statute should be sustained. But the Court of Appeals of New York had said that it found no material difference between the two statutes and this Court held that the 'meaning of the statute' as fixed by the decision of the state court 'must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment.' \n298 \nU.S. 587\n, at page 609, 56 S. Ct. 918, 922, 103 A.L.R. 1445. That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead Case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins Case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought. Upon that point the Court said: 'The petition for the writ sought review upon the ground that this case (Morehead) is distinguishable from that one (Adkins). No application has been made for reconsideration of the constitutional question there decided. The validity of the principles upon which that decision rests is not challenged. This court confines itself to the ground upon which the writ was asked or granted . * * * Here the review granted was no broader than sought by the petitioner. * * * He is not entitled and does not ask to be heard upon the question whether the Adkins Case should be overruled. He maintains that it may be distinguished on the ground that the statutes are vitally dissimilar.' \n298 \nU.S. 587\n, at pp. 604, 605, 920, 103 A.L.R. 1445.\n  We think that the question which was not deemed to be open in the Morehead Case is open and is necessarily presented here. The Supreme Court of Washington has upheld the minimum wage statute of that state. It has decided that the statute is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state. In reaching that conclusion, the state court has invoked principles long established by this Court in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state court has refused to regard the decision in the Adkins Case as determinative and has pointed to our decisions both before and since that case as justifying its position. We are of the opinion that this ruling of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 390]\n\u00a0\n the state court demands on our part a re-examination of the Adkins Case. The importance of the question, in which many states having similar laws are concerned, the close division by which the decision in the Adkins Case was reached, and the economic conditions which have supervened, and in the light of which the reasonableness of the exercise of the protective power of the state must be considered, make it not only appropriate, but we think imperative, that in deciding the present case the subject should receive fresh consideration.\n  The history of the litigation of this question may be briefly stated. The minimum wage statute of Washington was enacted over twenty-three years ago. Prior to the decision in the instant case, it had twice been held valid by the Supreme Court of the state. Larsen v. Rice, 100 Wash. 642, 171 P. 1037; Spokane Hotel Co. v. Younger, 113 Wash. 359, 194 P. 595. The Washington statute is essentially the same as that enacted in Oregon in the same year. Laws 1913 (Oregon) c. 62, p. 92. The validity of the latter act was sustained by the Supreme Court of Oregon in Stettler v. O'Hara, 69 Or. 519, 139 P. 743, L.R.A.1917C, 944, Ann.Cas.1916A, 217, and Simpson v. O'Hara, 70 Or. 261, 141 P. 158. These cases, after reargument, were affirmed here by an equally divided court, in 1917. \n243 \nU.S. 629\n. The law of Oregon thus continued in effect. The District of Columbia Minimum Wage Law (40 Stat. 960) was enacted in 1918. The statute was sustained by the Supreme Court of the District in the Adkins Case. Upon appeal the Court of Appeals of the District first affirmed that ruling, but on rehearing reversed it and the case came before this Court in 1923. The judgment of the Court of Appeals holding the act invalid was affirmed, but with Chief Justice Taft, Mr. Justice Holmes, and Mr. Justice Sanford dissenting, and Mr. Justice Brandeis taking no part. The dissenting opinions took the ground that the decision was at variance with the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 391]\n\u00a0\n principles which this Court had frequently announced and applied. In 1925 and 1927, the similar ninimum wage statutes of Arizona and Arkansas were held invalid upon the authority of the Adkins Case. The Justices who had dissented in that case bowed to the ruling and Mr. Justice Brandeis dissented. Murphy v. Sardell, \n269 \nU.S. 530\n; Donham v. West-Nelson Co., \n273 \nU.S. 657\n. The question did not come before us again until the last term in the Morehead Case, as already noted. In that case, briefs supporting the New York statute were submitted by the states of Ohio, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. 298 \nU.S. page 604, note, 103 A.L.R. 1445. Throughout this entire period the Washington statute now under consideration has been in force.\n  The principle which must control our decision is not in doubt. The constitutional provision invoked is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governing the states, as the due process clause invoked in theAdkins Case governed Congress. In each case the violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract. What is this freedom? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation, the Constitution does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty. Liberty in each of its phases has its history and connotation. But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people. Liberty under the Constitution is thus necessarily subject to the restraints of due process, and regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community is due process. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 392]\n\u00a0\n  This essential limitation of liberty in general governs freedom of contract in particular. More than twenty-five years ago we set forth the applicable principle in these words, after referring to the cases where the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been broadly described. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n'But it was recognized in the cases cited, as in many others, that freedom of contract is a qualified, and not an absolute, right. There is no absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses. The guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative supervision that wide department of activity which consists of the making of contracts, or deny to government the power to provide restrictive safeguards. Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community.' Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 565\n, 262.\n\n  This power under the Constitution to restrict freedom of contract has had many illustrations. \n2\n That it may be exercised in the public interest with respect to contracts \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 393]\n\u00a0\n between employer and employee is undeniable. Thus statutes have been sustained limiting employment in underground mines and smelters to eight hours a day (Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n); in requiring redemption in cash of store orders or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the payment of wages (Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 \nU.S. 13\n); in forbidding the payment of seamen's wages in advance (Patterson v. The Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169\n); in making it unlawful to contract to pay miners employed at quantity rates upon the basis of screened coal instead of the weight of the coal as originally produced in the mine (McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n); in prohibiting contracts limiting liability for injuries to employees (Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, supra); in limiting hours of work of employees in manufacturing establishments (Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426\n, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1043); and in maintaining workmen's compensation laws (New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, L.R.A.1917D, 1, Ann.Cas.1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, Ann.Cas.1917D, 642). In dealing with the relation of employer and employed, the Legislature has necessarily a wide field of discretion in order that there may be suitable protection of health and safety, and that peace and good order may be promoted through regulations designed to insure wholesome conditions of work and freedom from oppression. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, supra, \n219 \nU.S. 549\n, at page 570.\n  The point that has been strongly stressed that adult employees should be deemed competent to make their own contracts was decisively met nearly forty years ago in Holden v. Hardy, supra, where we pointed out the inequality in the footing of the parties. We said (Id., \n169 \nU.S. 366, 397\n, 390):\n'The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many states has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 394]\n\u00a0\n their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employe s, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules, and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority.'\n\n  And we added that the fact 'that both parties are of full age, and competent to contract, does not necessarily deprive the state of the power to interfere, where the parties do not stand upon an equality, or where the public heath demands that one party to the contract shall be protected against himself.' 'The state still retains an interest in his welfare, however reckless he may be. The whole is no greater than the sum of all the parts, and when the individual health, safety, and welfare are sacrificed or neglected, the state must suffer.'\n  It is manifest that this established principle is peculiarly applicable in relation to the employment of women in whose protection the state has a special interest. That phase of the subject received elaborate consideration in Muller v. Oregon (1908) \n208 \nU.S. 412, 326\n, 13 Ann.Cas. 957, where the constitutional authority of the state to limit the working hours of women was sustained. We emphasized the consideration that 'woman's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence' and that her physical well being 'becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.' We emphasized the need of protecting women against oppression despite her possession of contractual rights. We said that 'though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 395]\n\u00a0\n disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights. She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right.' Hence she was 'properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men, and could not be sustained.' We concluded that the limitations which the statute there in question 'places upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer, as to the time she shall labor' were 'not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.' Again, in Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, in referring to a differentiation with respect to the employment of women, we said that the Fourteenth Amendment did not interfere with state power by creating a 'fictitious equality.' We referred to recognized classifications on the basis of sex with regard to hours of work and in other matters, and we observed that the particular points at which that difference shall be enforced by legislation were largely in the power of the state. In later rulings this Court sustained the regulation of hours of work of women employees in Riley v. Massachusetts, \n232 \nU.S. 671\n (factories), Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373\n, L.R.A.1915F, 829 (hotels), and Bosley v. McLaughlin, \n236 \nU.S. 385\n (hospitals).\n  This array of precedents and the principles they applied were thought by the dissenting Justices in the Adkins Case to demand that the minimum wage statute be sustained. The validity of the distinction made by the Court between a minimum wage and a maximum of hours in limiting liberty of contract was especially challenged. \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at page 564, 403, 24 A.L.R. 1238. That challenge persists and is without any satisfactory answer. As Chief Justice Taft observed: 'In absolute freedom of contract the one term is as important as the other, for both enter equally into the consideration given and received, a restriction as to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 396]\n\u00a0\n the one is not any greater in essence than the other, and is of the same kind. One is the multiplier and the other the multiplicand.' And Mr. Justice Holmes, while recognizing that 'the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree,' could 'perceive no difference in the kind or degree of interference with liberty, the only matter with which we have any concern, between the one case and the other. The bargain is equally affected whichever half you regulate.' Id., \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at p. 569, 43 S. Ct. 394, 405, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n  One of the points which was pressed by the Court in supporting its ruling in the Adkins Case was that the standard set up by the District of Columbia Act did not take appropriate account of the value of the services rendered. In the Morehead Case, the minority thought that the New York statute had met that point in its definition of a 'fair wage' and that it accordingly presented a distinguishable feature which the Court could recognize within the limits which the Morehead petition for certiorari was deemed to present. The Court, however, did not take that view and the New York Act was held to be essentially the same as that for the District of Columbia. The statute now before us is like the latter, but we are unable to conclude that in its minimum wage requirement the state has passed beyond the boundary of its broad protective power.\n  The minimum wage to be paid under the Washington statute is fixed after full consideration by representatives of employers, employees, and the public. It may be assumed that the minimum wage is fixed in consideration of the services that are performed in the particular occupations under normal conditions. Provision is made for special licenses at less wages in the case of women who are incapable of full service. The statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Adkins Case is pertinent: 'This statute does not compel anybody to pay anything. It simply forbids employment at rates below those fixed as \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 397]\n\u00a0\n the minimum requirement of health and right living. It is safe to assume that women will not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed unless they earn them, or unless the employer's business can sustain the burden. In short the law in its character and operation is like hundreds of so- called police laws that have been up-held.' \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at page 570, 406, 24 A.L.R. 1238. And Chief Justice Taft forcibly pointed out the consideration which is basic in a statute of this character: 'Legislatures which adopt a requirement of maximum hours or minimum wages may be presumed to believe that when sweating employers are prevented from paying unduly low wages by positive law they will continue their business, abating that part of their profits, which were wrung from the necessities of their employees, and will concede the better terms required by the law, and that while in individual cases, hardship may result, the restriction will enure to the benefit of the general class of employees in whose interest the law is passed, and so to that of the community at large.' Id., \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at page 563, 403, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n  We think that the views thus expressed are sound and that the decision in the Adkins Case was a departure from the true application of the principles governing the regulation by the state of the relation of employer and employed. Those principles have been reenforced by our subsequent decisions. Thus in Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292\n, we sustained the New York statute which restricted the employment of women in restaurants at night. In O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Company, \n282 \nU.S. 251, 72\n A.L.R. 1163, which upheld an act regulating the commissions of insurance agents, we pointed to the presumption of the constitutionality of a statute dealing with a subject within the scope of the police power and to the absence of any factual foundation of record for deciding that the limits of power had been transcended. In Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 89\n A.L.R. 1469, dealing \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 398]\n\u00a0\n with the New York statute providing for minimum prices for milk, the general subject of the regulation of the use of private property and of the making of private contracts received an exhaustive examination, and we again declared that if such laws 'have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of dur process are satisfied'; that 'with the wisdom of the policy adopted, with the adequacy or practicability of the law enacted to forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to deal'; that 'times without number we have said that the Legislature is primarily the judge of the necessity of such an enactment, that every possible presumption is in favor of its validity, and that though the court may hold views inconsistent with the wisdom of the law, it may not be annulled unless palpably in excess of legislative power.' Id., \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, at pages 537, 538, 516, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n  With full recognition of the earnestness and vigor which characterize the prevailing opinion in the Adkins Case, we find it impossible to reconcile that ruling with these well-considered declarations. What can be closer to the public interest than the health of women and their protection from unscrupulous and overreaching employers? And if the protection of women is a legitimate end of the exercise of state power, how can it be said that the requirement of the payment of a minimum wage fairly fixed in order to meet the very necessities of existence is not an admissible means to that end? The Legislature of the state was clearly entitled to consider the situation of women in employment, the fact that they are in the class receiving the least pay, that their bargaining power is relatively weak, and that they are the ready victims of those who would take advantage of their necessitous circumstances. The Legislature was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the 'sweating sys- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 399]\n\u00a0\n tem,' the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living, thus making their very helplessness the occastion of a most injurious competition. The Legislature had the right to consider that its minimum wage requirements would be an important aid in carrying out its policy of protection. The adoption of similar requirements by many states evidences a deepseated conviction both as to the presence of the evil and as to the means adapted to check it. Legislative response to that conviction cannot be regarded as arbitrary or capricious and that is all we have to decide. Even if the wisdom of the policy be regarded as debatable and its effects uncertain, still the Legislature is entitled to its judgment.\n  There is an additional and compelling consideration which recent economic experience has brought into a strong light. The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power and are thus relatively defenseless against the denial of a living wage is not only detrimental to their health and well being, but casts a direct burden for their support upon the community. What these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to pay. The bare cost of living must be met. We may take judicial notice of the unparalleled demands for relief which arose during the recent period of depression and still continue to an alarming extent despite the degree of economic recovery which has been achieved. It is unnecessary to cite official statistics to establish what is of common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land. While in the instant case no factual brief has been presented, there is no reason to doubt that the state of Washington has encountered the same social problem that is present elsewhere. The community is not bound to provide what is in effect a subsidy for unconscionable employers. The \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 400]\n\u00a0\n community may direct its law-making power to correct the abuse which springs from their selfish disregard of the public interest. The argument that the legislation in question constitutes an arbitrary discrimination, because it does not extend to men, is unavailing. This Court has frequently held that the legislative authority, acting within its proper field, is not bound to extend its regulation to all cases which it might possibly reach. The Legislature 'is free to recognize degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest.' If 'the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.' There is no 'doctrinaire requirement' that the legislation should be couched in all embracing terms. Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n; Sproles v. binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 396\n, 588; Semler v. Oregon Board, \n294 \nU.S. 608, 610\n, 611, 571. This familiar principle has repeatedly been applied to legislation which singles out women, and particular classes of women, in the exercise of the state's protective power. Miller v. Wilson, supra, \n236 \nU.S. 373\n, at page 384, L.R.A.1915F, 829; Bosley v. McLaughlin, supra, \n236 \nU.S. 385\n, at pages 394, 395; Radice v. New York, supra, \n264 \nU.S. 292\n, at pages 295-298, 326, 327. Their relative need in the presence of the evil, no less than the existence of the evil itself, is a matter for the legislative judgment.\n  Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the state of Washington is affirmed.\n  Affirmed.\n\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND.\n  Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Jjstice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 401]\n\u00a0\n  The principles and authorities relied upon to sustain the judgment were considered in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 24\n A.L.R. 1238, and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587, 103\n A.L.R. 1445, and their lack of application to cases like the one in hand was pointed out. A sufficient answer to all that is now said will be found in the opinions of the court in those cases. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it seems well to restate our reasons and conclusions.\n  Under our form of government, where the written Constitution, by its own terms, is the supreme law, some agency, of necessity, must have the power to say the final word as to the validity of a statute assailed as unconstitutional. The Constitution makes it clear that the power has been intrusted to this court when the question arises in a controversy within its jurisdiction; and so long as the power remains there, its exercise cannot be avoided without betrayal of the trust.\n  It has been pointed out many times, as in the Adkins Case, that this judicial duty is one of gravity and delicacy; and that rational doubts must be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute. But whose doubts, and by whom resolved? Undoubtedly it is the duty of a member of the court, in the process of reaching a right conclusion, to give due weight to the opposing views of his associates; but in the end, the question which he must answer is not whether such views seem sound to those who entertain them, but whether they convince him that the statute is constitutional or engender in his mind a rational doubt upon that issue. The oath which he takes as a judge is not a composite oath, but an individual one. And in passing upon the validity of a statute, he discharges a duty imposed upon him, which cannot be consummated justly by an automatic acceptance of the views of others which have neither convinced, nor created a reasonable doubt in, his mind. If upon a question so \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 402]\n\u00a0\n important he thus surrender his deliberate judgment, he stands forsworn. He cannot subordinate his convictions to that extent and keep faith with his oath or retain his judicial and moral independence.\n  The suggestion that the only check upon the exercise of the judicial power, when properly invoked, to declare a constitutional right superior to an unconstitutional statute is the judge's own faculty of self- restraint, is both ill considered and mischievous. Self-restraint belongs in the domain of will and not of judgment. The check upon the judge is that imposed by his oath of office, by the Constitution, and by his own conscientious and informed convictions; and since he has the duty to make up his own mind and adjudge accordingly, it is hard to see how there could be any other restraint. This Court acts as a unit. It cannot act in any other way; and the majority (whether a bare majority or a majority of all but one of its members), therefore, establishes the controlling rule as the decision of the court, binding, so long as it remains unchanged, equally upon those who disagree and upon those who subscribe to it. Otherwise, orderly administration of justice would cease. But it is the right of those in the minority to disagree, and sometimes, in matters of grave importance, their imperative duty to voice their disagreement at such length as the occasion demands-always, of course, in terms which, however forceful, do not offend the proprieties or impugn the good faith of those who think otherwise.\n  It is urged that the question involved should now receive fresh consideration, among other reasons, because of 'the economic conditions which have supervened'; but the meaning of the Constitution does not change with the ebb and flow of economic events. We frequently are told in more general words that the Constitution must be construed in the light of the present. If by that it is meant that the Constitution is made up of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 403]\n\u00a0\n living words that apply to every new condition which they include, the statement is quite true. But to say, if that be intended, that the words of the Constitution mean today what they did not mean when written-that is, that they do not apply to a situation now to which they would have applied then-is to rob that instrument of the essential element which continues it in force as the people have made it until they, and not their official agents, have made it otherwise.\n  The words of Judge Campbell in People ex rel. Twitchell v. Blodgett, 13 Mich. 127, 139, 140, apply with peculiar force. 'But it may easily happen,' he said, 'that specific provisions may, in unforeseen emergencies, turn out to have been inexpedient. This does not make these provisions any less binding. Constitutions can not be changed by events alone. They remain binding as the acts of the people in their sovereign capacity, as the framers of Government, until they are amended or abrogated by the action prescribed by the authority which created them. It is not competent for any department of the Government to change a constitution, or declare it changed, simply because it appears ill adapted to a new state of things . * * *\n'Restrictions have, it is true, been found more likely than grants to be unsuited to unforeseen circumstances. * * * But, where evils arise from the application of such regulations, their force cannot be denied or evaded; and the remedy consists in repeal or amendment, and not in false construction.' The principle is reflected in many decisions of this Court. See South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 448\n, 449, 4 Ann.Cas. 737; Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 95\n; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 723; Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 410, 431, 432; Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1, 12\n; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581, 602\n; Jarrolt v. Moberly, \n103 \nU.S. 580, 586\n. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 404]\n\u00a0\n  The judicial function is that of interpretation; it does not include the power of amendment under the guise of interpretation. To miss the point of difference between the two is to miss all that the phrase 'supreme law of the land' stands for and to convert what was intended as inescapable and enduring mandates into mere moral reflections.\n\n  If the Constitution, intelligently and reasonably construed in the light of these principles, stands in the way of desirable legislation, the blame must rest upon that instrument, and not upon the court for enforcing it according to its terms. The remedy in that situation-and the only true remedy-is to amend the Constitution. Judge Cooley, in the first volume of his Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 124, very clearly pointed out that much of the benefit expected from written Constitutions would be lost if their provisions were to be bent to circumstances or modified by public opinion. He pointed out that the common law, unlike a Constitution, was subject to modification by public sentiment and action which the courts might recognize; but that 'a court or legislature which should allow a change in public sentiment to influence it in giving to a written constitution a construction not warranted by the intention of its founders, would be justly chargeable with reckless disregard of official oath and public duty; and if its course could become a precedent, these instruments would be of little avail. * * * What a court is to do, therefore, is to declare the law as written, leaving it to the people themselves to make such changes as new circumstances may require. The meaning of the constitution is fixed when it is adopted, and it is not different at any subsequent time when a court has occasion to pass upon it.'\n  The Adkins Case dealt with an Act of Congress which had passed the scrutiny both of the legislative and executive branches of the government. We recognized that \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 405]\n\u00a0\n thereby these departments had affirmed the validity of the statute, and properly declared that their determination must be given great weight, but we then concluded, after thorough consideration, that their view could not be sustained. We think it not inappropriate now to add a word on that subject before coming to the question immediately under review.\n  The people by their Constitution created three separate, distinct, independent, and coequal departments of government. The governmental structure rests, and was intended to rest, not upon any one or upon any two, but upon all three of these fundamental pillars. It seems unnecessary to repeat, what so often has been said, that the powers of these departments are different and are to be exercised independently. The differences clearly and definitely appear in the Constitution. Each of the departments is an agent of its creator; and one department is not and cannot be the agent of another. Each is answerable to its creator for what it does, and not to another agent. The view, therefore, of the Executive and of Congress that an act is constitutional is persuasive in a high degree; but it is not controlling.\n  Coming, then, to a consideration of the Washington statute, it first is to be observed that it is in every substantial respect identical with the statute involved in the Adkins Case. Such vices as existed in the latter are present in the former. And if the Adkins Case was properly decided, as we who join in this opinion think it was, it necessarily follows that the Washington statute is invalid.\n  In support of minimum-wage legislation, it has been urged, on the one hand, that great benefits will result in favor of underpaid labor, and, on the other hand, that the danger of such legislation is that the minimum will tend to become the maximum and thus bring down the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 406]\n\u00a0\n earnings of the more efficient toward the level of the less-efficient employees. But with these speculations we have nothing to do. We are concerned only with the question of constitutionality.\n  That the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids a state to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law includes freedom of contract is so well settled as to be no longer open to question. Nor reasonably can it be disputed that contracts of employment of labor are included in the rule. Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 174\n, 175, 280, 13 Ann.Cas. 764; Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 14, L.R.A. 1915C, 960. In the first of these cases, Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, said, 'The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell it. * * * In all such particulars the employer and the employee have equality of right, and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land.'\n  In the Adkins Case we referred to this language, and said that while there was no such thing as absolute freedom of contract, but that it was subject to a great variety of restraints, nevertheless, freedom of contract was the general rule and restraint the exception; and that the power to abridge that freedom could only be justified by the existence of exceptional circumstances. This statement of the rule has been many times affirmed; and we do not understand that it is questioned by the present decision.\n  We further pointed out four distinct classes of cases in which this court from time to time had upheld statutory interferences with the liberty of contract. They were, in brief, (1) statutes fixing rates and charges to be \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 407]\n\u00a0\n exacted by businesses impressed with a public interest; (2) statutes relating to contracts for the performance of public work; (3) statutes prescribing the character, methods, and time for payment of wages; and (4) statutes fixing hours of labor. It is the last class that has been most relied upon as affording support for minimum-wage legislation; and much of the opinion in the Adkins Case, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 547\n-553, 397- 399, 24 A.L.R. 1238, is devoted to pointing out the essential distinction between fixing hours of labor and fixing wages. What is there said need not be repeated. It is enough for present purposes to say that statutes of the former class deal with an incident of the employment, having no necessary effect upon wages. The parties are left free to contract about wages, and thereby equalize such additional burdens as may be imposed upon the employer as a result of the restrictions as to hours by an adjustment in respect of the amount of wages. This court, wherever the question is adverted to, has been careful to disclaim any purpose to uphold such legislation as fixing wages, and has recognized an essential difference between the two. E.g., Bunting v. Oregon, \n243 \nU.S. 426\n, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1043; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 345\n, 346, 353, 354, L.R.A.1917E, 938, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1024; and see Freund, Police Power,  318.\n  We then pointed out that minimumwage legislation such as that here involved does not deal with any business charged with a public interest, or with public work, or with a temporary emergency, or with the character, methods, or periods of wage payments, or with hours of labor, or with the protection of persons under legal disability, or with the prevention of fraud. It is, simply and exclusively, a law fixing wages for adult women who are legally as capable of contracting for themselves as men, and cannot be sustained unless upon principles apart from those involved in cases already decided by the court.\n  Two cases were involved in the Adkins decision. In one of them it appeared that a woman twenty-one years of age, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 408]\n\u00a0\n who brought the suit, was employed as an elevator operator at a fixed salary. Her services were satisfactory, and she was anxious to retain her position, and her employer, while willing to retain her, was obliged to dispense with her services on account of the penalties prescribed by the act. The wages received by her were the best she was able to obtain for any work she was capable of performing; and the enforcement of the order deprived her, as she alleged, not only of that employment, but left her unable to secure any position at which she could make a living with as good physical and moral surroundings and as good wages as she was receiving and was willing to take. The Washington statute, of course, admits of the same situation and result, and, for aught that appears to the contrary the situation in the present case may have been the same as that just described. Certainly, to the extent that the statute applies to such cases, it cannot be justified as a reasonable restraint upon the freedom of contract. On the contrary, it is essentially arbitrary.\n  Neither the statute involved in the Adkins Case nor the Washington statute, so far as it is involved here, has the slightest relation to the capacity or earning power of the employee, to the number of hours which constitute the day's work, the character of the place where the work is to be done, or the circumstances or surroundings of the employment. The sole basis upon which the question of validity rests is the assumption that the employee is entitled to receive a sum of money sufficient to provide a living for her, keep her in health and preserve her morals. And, as we pointed out at some length in that case (\n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at pages 555-557, 400, 401, 24 A.L.R. 1238), the question thus presented for the determination of the board can not be solved by any general formula prescribed by a statutory bureau, since it is not a composite but an individual question to be answered for each individual, considered by herself. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 409]\n\u00a0\n What we said further in that case (\n261 \nU.S. 525\n, at pages 557-559, 401, 24 A.L.R. 1238), is equally applicable here:\n'The law takes account of the necessities of only one party to the contract. It ignores the necessities of the employer by compelling him to pay not less than a certain sum, not only whether the employee is capable of earning it, but irrespective of the ability of his business to sustain the burden, generously leaving him, of course, the privilege of abandoning his business as an alternative for going on at a loss. Within the limits of the minimum sum, he is precluded, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, from adjusting compensation to the differing merits of his employees. It compels him to pay at least the sum fixed in any event, because the employee needs it, but requires no service of equivalent value from the employee. It therefore undertakes to solve but one-half of the problem. The other half is the establishment of a corresponding standard of efficiency, and this forms no part of the policy of the legislation, although in practice the former half without the latter must lead to ultimate failure, in accordance with the inexorable law that no one can continue indefinitely to take out more than he puts in without ultimately exhausting the supply. The law is not confined to the great and powerful employers but embraces those whose bargaining power may be as weak as that of the employee. It takes no account of periods of stress and business depression, of crippling losses, which may leave the employer himself without adequate means of livelihood. To the extent that the sum fixed exceeds the fair value of the services rendered, it amounts to a compulsory exaction from the employer for the support of a partially indigent person, for whose condition there rests upon him no peculiar responsibility, and therefore, in effect, arbitrarily shifts to his shoulders a burden which, if it belongs to anybody, belongs to society as a whole.\n\n'The feature of this statute, which perhaps more than any other, puts upon it the stamp of invalidity, is that it \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 410]\n\u00a0\n exacts from the employer an arbitrary payment for a purpose and upon a basis having no causal connection with his business, or the contract or the work the employee engages to do. The declared basis, as already pointed out, is not the value of the service rendered, but the extraneous circumstance that the employee needs to get a prescribed sum of money to insure her subsistence, health, and morals. The ethical right of every worker, man or woman, to a living wage may be conceded. One of the declared and important purposes of trade organizations is to secure it. And with that principle and with every legitimate effort to realize it in fact, no one can quarrel; but the fallacy of the proposed method of attaining it is that it assumes that every employer is bound at all events to furnish it. The moral requirement implicit in every contract of employment, viz. that the amount to be paid and the service to be rendered shall bear to each other some relation of just equivalence, is completely ignored. The necessities of the employee are alone considered, and these arise outside of the employment, are the same when there is no employment, and as great in one occupation as in another. Certainly the employer, by paying a fair equivalent for the service rendered, though not sufficient to support the employee, has neither caused nor contributed to her poverty. On the contrary, to the extent of what he pays, he has relieved it. In principle, there can be no difference between the case of selling labor and the case of selling goods. If one goes to the butcher, the baker, or grocer to buy food, he is morally entitled to obtain the worth of his money; but he is not entitled to more. It what he gets is worth what he pays, he is not justified in demanding more, simply because he needs more; and the shopkeeper, having dealt fairly and honestly in that transaction, is not concerned in any peculiar sense with the question of his customer's necessities. Should a statute undertake to vest in a commission \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 411]\n\u00a0\n power to determine the quantity of food necessary for individual support, and require the shopkeeper, if he sell to the individual at all, to furnish that quantity at not more than a fixed maximum, it would undoubtedly fall before the constitutional test. The fallacy of any argument in support of the validity of such a statute would be quickly exposed. The argument in support of that now being considered is equally fallacious, though the weakness of it may not be so plain. A statute requiring an employer to pay in money, to pay at prescribed and regular intervals, to pay the value of the services rendered, even to pay with fair relation to the extent of the benefit obtained from the service, would be understandable. But a statute which prescribes payment without regard to any of these things, and solely with relation to circumstances apart from the contract of employment, the business affected by it, and the work done under it, is so clearly the product of a naked, arbitrary exercise of power that it cannot be allowed to stand under the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n  Whether this would be equally or at all true in respect of the statutes of some of the states we are not called upon to say. They are not now before us; and it is enough that it applies in every particular to the Washington statute now under consideration.\n  The Washington statute, like the one for the District of Columbia, fixes minimum wages for adult women. Adult men and their employers are left free to bargain as they please; and it is a significant and an important fact that all state statutes to which our attention has been called are of like character. The common-law rules restricting the power of women to make contracts have, under our system, long since practically disappeared. Women today stand upon a legal and political equality with men. There is no longer any reason why they should be put in different classes in respect of their legal \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 412]\n\u00a0\n right to make contracts; nor should they be denied, in effect, the right to compete with men for work paying lower wages which men may be willing to accept. And it is an arbitrary exercise of the legislative power to do so. In the Tipaldo Case, \n298 \nU.S. 587, 615\n, 925, 103 A.L.R. 1445, it appeared that the New York Legislature had passed two minimum-wage measures-one dealing with women alone, the other with both men and women. The act which included men was vetoed by the Governor. The other, applying to women alone, was approved. The 'factual background' in respect of both measures was substantially the same. In pointing out the arbitrary discrimination which resulted (\n298 \nU.S. 587\n, at pages 615-617, 925, 103 A.L.R. 1445), we said:\n'These legislative declarations, in form of findings or recitals of fact, serve well to illustrate why any measure that deprives employers and adult women of freedom to agree upon wages, leaving employers and men employees free so to do, is necessarily arbitrary. Much, if not all that in them is said in justification of the regulations that the act imposes in respect of women's wages apply with equal force in support of the same regulation of men's wages. While men are left free to fix their wages by agreement with employers, it would be fanciful to suppose that the regulation of women's wages would be useful to prevent or lessen the evils listed in the first section of the act. Men in need of work are as likely as women to accept the low wages offered by unscrupulous employers. Men in greater number than women support themselves and dependents and because of need will work for whatever wages they can get and that without regard to the value of the service and even though the pay is less than minima prescribed in accordance with this act. It is plain that, under circumstances such as those portrayed in the 'factual background,' prescribing of minimum wages for women alone would unreasonably restrain them \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 413]\n\u00a0\n in competition with men and tend arbitrarily to deprive them of employment and a fair chance to find work.'\n\n  An appeal to the principle that the Legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm and confine its restrictions accordingly, is but to beg the question, which is-Since the contractual rights of men and women are the same, does the legislation here involved, by restricting only the rights of women to make contracts as to wages, create an arbitrary discrimination? We think it does. Difference of sex affords no reasonable ground for making a restriction applicable to the wage contracts of all working women from which like contracts of all working men are left free. Certainly a suggestion that the bargaining ability of the average woman is not equal to that of the average man would lack substance. The ability to make a fair bargain, as every one knows, does not depend upon sex.\n  If, in the light of the facts, the state legislation, without reason or for reasons of mere expediency, excluded men from the provisions of the legislation, the power was exercised arbitrarily. On the other hand, if such legislation in respect of men was properly omitted on the ground that it would be unconstitutional, the same conclusion of unconstitutionality is inescapable in respect of similar legislative restraint in the case of women. Adkins Case, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 553\n, 399, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n  Finally, it may be said that a statute absolutely fixing wages in the various industries at definite sums and forbidding employers and employees from contracting for any other than those designated would probably not be thought to be constitutional. It is hard to see why the power to fix minimum wages does not connote a like power in respect of maximum wages. And yet, if both powers be exercised in such a way that the minimum and the maximum so nearly approach each other as to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 379\n, 414]\n\u00a0\n become substantially the same, the right to make any contract in respect of wages will have been completely abrogated.\n  A more complete discussion may be found in the Adkins and Tipaldo Cases cited supra. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Allgeyer v.

ARONSON(1937)\nNo. 20\nArgued: October 20, 1937Decided: November 8, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n Paul A. Freund, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Samuel Gottlieb and Israel Gorovitz, both of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, Aronson, trustee in bankruptcy of the Viking Manufacturing Company, Inc., brought suit in the United States District Court for Massachusetts to recover $37,021.63 exacted of the bankrupt by the collector, under color of section 609, Revenue Act 1932,1 (chapter 209, 47 Stat. 264 (26 U.S.C.A. note at end of chapter 20)), on account of jigsaw picture puzzles manufactured and sold from June 21, 1932, to May 1, 1933\n\n\n The puzzles were made by cutting selected pictures backed up by rigid cardboard into from 162 to 500 separate pieces. These were sold to those who found diversion or amusement in putting them together so as to reproduce the original picture.\n Obviously the word 'games' in the statute was intended to designate instrumentalities used in playing them.\n The collector maintained that the effort properly to arrange the pieces was for amusement or diversion and amounted to a game, within the appropriate definition of the word. \n2\n Accordingly, he said, these instrumentalities were taxable. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand, respondent insisted that the word 'games' refers to contests, physical or mental, conducted according to set rules, undertaken for amusement or recreation or for winning a stake, requiring the participation of two or more persons;2 also that the sundry pieces were parts of a puzzle, a contrivance designed for testing ingenuity- something not within the scope of the statute. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The trial judge, having heard the cause upon pleadings and evidence without a jury, sustained the collector's defense. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded otherwise and directed judgment for the trustee. It said:\n'The section (609) is headed 'Tax on Sporting Goods.' The articles or instrumentalities there specifically named are sporting goods whether they are used in connection with games or in some recreation or diversion other than a game. But the larger portion of the article specifically named are all used in games of contest between two \n\n[302 \nU.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n or more persons, and the question of construction is whether the articles or instrumentalities intended to be covered by the phrase 'games and parts of games' means articles or instrumentalities used in games or contest like the specific articles previously named in the section, which are used in games of tennis, polo, baseball, etc., all of which involve a contest . ...\n\n'Furthermore, the particular article here sought to be taxed is a puzzle. A puzzle is defined as 'something which perplexes or embarrasses; a difficult problem or question; hence a toy, contrivance, question or problem designed for testing ingenuity; as a cross word puzzle.' Webster's New International Dictionary. A jigsaw picture puzzle comes squarely within this definition-'a contrivance ... designed for testing ingenuity.' None of the articles specifically named in the statute and used in games is a contrivance designed for testing ingenuity. They are designed for use in games of contest, while a jigsaw puzzle is not.'\n\n Section 600(f), (c. 63, 40 Stat. 316) Revenue Act 1917, and section 900(5), (c. 18, 40 Stat. 1122) Revenue Act 1918 (repealed in 1921 (42 Stat. 321)), laid a tax upon tennis rackets, golf clubs, baseball bats, etc., 'chess and checker boards and pieces, dice, games and parts of games.' Jigsaw picture puzzles were then well-known articles of commerce. They go back at least to the first part of the last century-perhaps much farther. The same words 'games or parts of games' appear again in the like section- 609-Revenue Act 1932.\n The court below pointed out that: 'A jigsaw puzzle was never taxed under Section 900(5) of the Revenue Act of 1918. It was not taxed until after the passage of section 609 of the Revenue Act of 1932, when the government attempted to tax it as a game. The act of 1932 became effective June 6, 1932. On August 26, 1932, the Commissioner issued a ruling stating that \n\n[302 \nU.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n jigsaw or die cut picture puzzles were not taxable. On November 14, 1932, he issued a ruling that they were taxable. On February 7, 1933, he ruled that after February 7, 1933, they were taxable if they contained more than fifty pieces. And on April 20, 1933, he ruled that they were taxable after June 21, 1932, if they contained more than fifty pieces.'\n Ample evidence disclosed that in commercial usage jigsaw picture puzzles were never regarded as games; also that the trade recognized a definite distinction between puzzles and games. We must assume that Congress had knowledge of these things; also knew that jigsaw picture puzzles were not assessed for taxes under the acts of 1917 and 1918; and, further, was not unmindful of the uncertainties concerning the meaning of 'game' disclosed by Baltimore Talking Board Co. v. Miles (C.C.A.) 280 F. 658, and Mills Novelty Co. v. United States (Ct.Cl.) 50 F.(2d) 476.\n The claim for the taxpayer here does not rest upon an exception to a general rule but upon construction of general language found in the act.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly concluded that: 'The words 'games and parts of games' bring into the list of taxables only such other articles as are used in games of contest, the same as those particularly named are and with which they are closely associated.'\n Certainly we cannot say that this construction was clearly erroneous. Other judges had accepted it. Nor can we affirm that the statute as framed gave adequate notice to the bankrupt that its puzzles were to be taxed.\n Where there is a reasonable doubt as to the meaning of a taxing act it should be construed most favorably to the taxpayer. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151\n, 38 S.Ct. 53. 'Tax laws, like all other laws, are made to be obeyed. They \n\n[302 \nU.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n should therefore be intelligible to those who are expected to obey them.' Philadelphia Storage Battery Co. v. Lederer (D.C.) 21 F.(2d) 320, 321, 322.\n Counsel for the collector maintain that Baltimore Talking Board Co. v. Miles (1922), supra, the 'Ouija Board' Case, and Mills Novelty Co. v. United States (1931), supra, 'Coin Operated Gambling Machine' Case, are in conflict with the ruling under review.\n These causes involved the act of 1918 and in both the judges expressed sharply opposing views. Of course, the general language of the opinions must be read in connection with the facts.\n The ouija board is wholly different from the puzzle here under consideration; nothing indicates that it was commonly regarded by the trade as a puzzle; and in an application for a patent it had once been described as a game. If the opinion construes the statute as embracing all instrumentalities, not necessary for comfort, whose chief use is to afford amusement and diversion, it is obviously too broad. Knitting for diversion is not a 'game'; nor is horseback riding.\n The coin-operated gambling machine has no resemblance to a jigsaw picture puzzle and what was said concerning it is not helpful in the problem now before us.\n Both of these causes were decided prior to the act of 1932 in which the words of the 1918 act were repeated notwithstanding the disclosed uncertainties concerning their meaning and with knowledge of the fact that theretofore puzzles had not been assessed for taxation under them.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act 1932.

BINENSTOCK(1937)\nNo. 36\nArgued: November 17, 1937Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n Messrs. James M. Kane and George P. Barse, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert T. McCracken, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by respondents in a federal district court in Pennsylvania seeking to have allowed as a set-off against the indebtedness of the partnership firm \n\n[302 \nU.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n of Swinger and Binenstock to the Commercial National Bank the amount of a deposit in the bank by Swinger, now deceased, and so much of a deposit by Binenstock as might be necessary to cancel the indebtedness. The bank was organized under the National Bank Act of the United States (12 U.S.C.A.  21 et seq.), and as such was engaged in business in Pennsylvania. On January 9, 1933, the partnership executed and delivered its promissory note to the bank in the sum of $10,000; and on February 28, 1933, executed and delivered to the bank its further promissory note in the same amount. Under date of January 25, 1933, one Luciano Cammarota executed and delivered to the partnership his promissory note for $300, which note was endorsed and discounted at the bank.\n At the close of business on February 28, Swinger had on deposit in the bank the sum of $1,546.58, and Binenstock the sum of $32,323.76. At the same time, the partnership had on deposit the sum of $5,822.52. On that date the bank became insolvent and was taken over by the Comptroller of Currency, who appointed petitioner, Willing, receiver. Petitioner, when the suit was brought, had reduced the indebtedness of the partnership by allowing a set-off of the amount of the partnership deposit, but had failed and refused to allow as a set-off the amounts here in controversy.\n Upon these facts the district court sustained the claim of respondents, 18 F.Supp. 262, and entered a decree allowing the set-off of the individual deposits against the joint indebtedness of the partnership, ordering a cancellation and return of the partnership promissory notes, and allowing a claim of Binenstock against the assets of the bank for the amount of his deposit, after making provision for the set-off. The decree also directed petitioner to endorse, without recourse, and deliver to Binenstock, the note of Cammarota for $300. Upon appeal, the court below affirmed. (C.C.A.) 88 F.2d 474. The decrees in both \n\n[302 \nU.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n courts were based upon what was understood and declared by them to be the Pennsylvania rule upon the subject.\n The case has been elaborately argued upon both sides; but, in respect of the partnership notes, we find it unnecessary to do more than consider and determine the question whether the courts below correctly stated the Pennsylvania law on the subject and were right in following it as the controlling rule of decision.\n First. In Miller v. Reed, 27 Pa. 244, 67 Am.Dec. 459, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that, whatever distinctions otherwise would exist between joint contracts and contracts joint and several, these distinctions, under the statutes of the state, had been obliterated. These statutes, it was said (27 Pa. 244, at page 249, 67 Am.Dec. 459), 'have taken away distinctions that were always embarrassing, and sometimes insuperable obstacles to the course of justice. There was no difference in the duty before, and none in the remedy now. The moral obligation is not affected by the words joint and several, and in Pennsylvania at least, the legal liability is not.' It, therefore, makes no difference here whether the Swinger and Binenstock notes were joint, or joint and several.\n In the opinion of the federal district court in this case, Judge Kirkpatrick said: 'The law of the state of Pennsylvania, if applicable, would clearly sustain the bill. The decisions of that state allow individual claims to be set off in equity against a joint liability even though the party asserting the joint liability is solvent. Stewart v. Coulter, 12 Serg. & R.(Pa.) 252, 14 Am.Dec. 680; Cochran v. Cutter, 18 Pa. Super. 282. See, also, Mintz v. Tri-County Natural Gas Company, 259 Pa. 477, 103 A. 285.' He held the law applicable and entered the decree accordingly. The court below affirmed on the authority of the opinion of the district judge.\n Petitioner challenges this view of the district judge, albeit faintly. The judges of both courts below have had \n\n[302 \nU.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n wide experience in the field of Pennsylvania law; and, even if the question were doubtful, as we think it is not, we should have little hesitation in accepting their determination as to the state law on the point here under consideration. We have, however, examined the decisions of the Pennsylvania courts, and fully agree with the courts below as to their interpretation.\n Second. We have no occasion to consider whether section 721 of the Revised Statutes (28 U.S.C.  725, 28 U.S.C.A.  725) is applicable.* Under Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, it would not be. That case has been much criticized, and the tendency of our decisions which have followed has been to limit it somewhat strictly. And one of the practical restrictions upon the principle of that case, which we have many times announced, is that, even where it applies, 'for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the federal courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.' Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 34 S., 2 S.Ct. 10, 21; Sim v. Edenborn, \n242 \nU.S. 131, 135\n, 37 S.Ct. 36, and authorities cited; Trainor Co. v. Aetna Casualty Co., \n290 \nU.S. 47, 54\n, 55 S., 54 S.Ct. 1, 2; Mutual Life Co. v. Johnson, \n293 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 55 S.Ct. 154, 156; Community Bldg. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co. (C.C.A.) 8 F.2d 678, 680. Even if there were a conflict between the decisions of the state and those of the lower federal courts, we should be free to apply the 'harmony' rule and follow the state decisions. We are, however, unable to find any such conflict.\n The case which seems most nearly in point is Roelker v. Bromley- Shepard Co. (C.C.A.) 73 F.2d 618; and that case, so far as it goes, is in harmony with the Pennsylvania rule. There, the company was indebted to the Middle \n\n[302 \nU.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n sex National Bank in the sum of $5,000 on a joint note signed by the company and Sarah Bromley Shepard. On the day the bank closed, the company had on deposit in the bank $5,611.10 and Sarah Bromley Shepard had on deposit the sum of $6,275.13. The court ordered that $5,000 of the $5,611. 10 due from the bank to the company be set off against the $5,000 due from the company to the bank on the joint note, holding that where justice requires and there is no adequate remedy at law, as was the case there, a court of equity will order a set-off.\n There is nothing in the National Banking Act or in any other federal statute which conflicts with the Pennsylvania rule. In the case of an insolvent bank, the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C.  194 (12 U.S.C.A.  194), simply provides for a 'ratable dividend' on all proved or adjudicated claims. This court held in Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 13 S.Ct. 148, 151, that the allowance of a valid set- off cannot be considered a preference, and that only the balance, after deduction of the set-off, constitutes part of the assets of the insolvent. 'The requirement,' the court said, 'as to ratable dividends, is to make them from what belongs to the bank, and that which at the time of the insolvency belongs of right to the debtor does not belong to the bank.'\n Third. The reason for the order of the district court requiring the surrender of the Cammarota note for $300 is not clear, but the requirement seems to be erroneous. It does not appear from the record whether Cammarota was solvent or insolvent. If he was solvent, the partnership was not entitled to set off its deposits against its secondary liability as endorser of the Cammarota note. See Williams v. Rose (D.C.) 218 F. 898, 900; Bank of United States v. Braverman, 259 N.Y. 65, 68, et seq., 181 N.E. 50, 82 A.L.R. 658, and authorities cited. 'To allow an indorser,' the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n New York court said, 259 N.Y. 65, at pages 70, 71, 181 N.E. 50, 52, 82 A.L. R. 658, 'to set off his deposit when the maker is solvent and able to indemnify the indorser as in this case would enable the indorser to collect the full amount unpaid on the note from the maker and at the same time receive a larger amount of his deposit than other depositors. Such a result would be inequitable.' An excellent statement in support of the foregoing view, and the reasons for it, will be found in the opinion delivered by Judge Parker in Shannon v. Sutherland, (C.C.A.) 74 F.2d 530, 531, 532, 97 A.L.R. 583.\n The facts are not sufficiently disclosed by the record to enable us to dispose of this item. The opinion of neither court deals with the subject, and respondents, neither in their brief nor oral argument, have had anything to say about it. In these circumstances, the case must be remanded to the district court for further consideration of the question, with authority, in its discretion, to take further evidence to that end. With that exception, the decree below is approved.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Sec. 721.

RILEY(1937)\nNo. 34\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1937\n\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Merrill S. June and Bradley B. Gilman, both of Worcester, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. James J. Ronan, of Salem, Mass., for Henry F. Long, Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation of Massachusetts, intervener by special leave of court.\n Mr. George S. Fuller, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the Federal Interpleader Act, section 24(26) of the Judicial Code as amended January 20, 1936, c. 13,  1, 49 Stat. 1096 (28 U.S.C.A.  41(26), may be availed of for the litigation and final disposition of the rival claims of two states, each asserting through its officers the right to recover death taxes on the ground that decedent was last domiciled within its boundaries.\n Petitioner is the duly qualified executor named in the last will of decedent, which has been probated in Massachusetts. Ancillary administration of the estate has been granted in California. Petitioner brought the present suit in the District Court for Massachusetts, joining as defendants Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, and respondents, officers of the state of California, all charged with the duty of administering death tax statutes of their respective states. The bill of complaint is founded upon the Interpleader Act, and seeks the remedy which it affords. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n Section 24(26) confers jurisdiction on the District Courts in suits of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader, by plaintiffs who are under an obligation to the amount of $500 or more, the benefits of which are demanded by two or more adverse claimants who are citizens of different states. By subsection 26(a), 'Such a suit in equity may be entertained although the titles or claims of the conflicting claimants do not have a common origin, or are not identical, but are adverse to and independent of one another.' And by subsection 26(a)(ii) and (d), complainant, upon satisfying jurisdictional requirements of the act, and depositing the money or property in the registry of the court, or upon giving a prescribed bond, is entitled to a decree discharging him from further liability and enjoining the claimants from further proceedings in other courts to recover the sum claimed.\n The bill of complaint alleges that decedent left bank deposits and other intangibles in California and Massachusetts, a substantial part of which has come into the possession or custody of petitioner; that respondents, the California taxing officials, have determined and assert that decedent at death was domiciled in California, and that under the law of that state his estate is subject to death taxes upon all his intangibles; that respondents threaten to assess and collect there a tax in excess of any which would be due if decedent were domiciled in Massachusetts; that the Massachusetts Commissioner, in behalf of the state, asserts a similar claim that decedent at death was domiciled in Massachusetts, and that his estate is subject to taxes there upon all his intangibles; that it is impossible in law and in fact for decedent to have been domiciled in both states at the time of his death, or for his estate to be subject to death taxes in both states as asserted; and that the attempted collection of the tax is a threatened deprivation of property without due proc- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n ess of law and a denial of equal protection of the laws. Petitioner prays that the Court order respondent officials of the two states to interplead their respective claims for the tax; that the Court determine the domicil of decedent, the amount of the tax, and the person or persons to whom it is payable; and that respondents be enjoined from any other proceedings to collect it.\n Respondents, the California officers, appeared specially and moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground, among others, that the suit was brought against respondents in their official capacity, and was in substance a suit against the state forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment. The District Court overruled this contention, and granted a temporary injunction restraining defendants until further order of the court, from taking any action to assess the tax. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, 89 F.2d 59, holding that the maintenance of the suit is an infringement of the Eleventh Amendment, which provides that: 'The Judicial power ... shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State.' We granted certiorari, \n301 \nU.S. 678\n, 57 S.Ct. 931; the decision below being of an important question of federal law which has not been but should be settled by this Court. Supreme Court Rules, rule 38, subd. 5(b), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354.\n Petitioner does not deny that a suit nominally against individuals, but restraining or otherwise affecting their action as state officers, may be in substance a suit against the state, which the Constitution forbids, Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 \nU.S. 711\n, 2 S.Ct. 128; Hagood v. Southern, \n117 \nU.S. 52\n, 6 S.Ct. 608; In re Ayers, \n123 \nU.S. 443\n, 8 S.Ct. 164; North Carolina v.

Roper, \n246 \nU.S. 335\n, 38 S.Ct. 317, or that generally suits to restrain action of state officials can, consistently with the constitutional prohibition, be prosecuted only when the action sought to be restrained is without the authority of state law or contravenes the statutes or Constitution of the United States. Cf. Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Scully v. Bird, \n209 \nU.S. 481\n, 28 S.Ct. 597; Old Colony Trust Co. v.

The Eleventh Amendment, which denies to the citizen the right to resort to a federal court to compel or restrain state action, does not preclude suit against a wrongdoer merely because he asserts that his acts are within an official authority which the state does not confer.\n Petitioner's contention is that here the prospective official action of respondents involves a threatened violation of the Constitution for which state law can afford no sanction. It is said that as the officers of each state assert the right to collect the tax out of decedent's property within the state, they may succeed in establishing that right by a judicial determination in each that decedent was last domiciled there, cf. Dorrance's Estate, 309 Pa. 151, 163 A. 303; In re Estate of Dorrance, 115 N.J.Eq. 268, 170 A. 601; Id., 116 N.J.Eq. 204, 172 A. 503, with New Jersey v. Pennsylvania, \n287 \nU.S. 580\n, 53 S.Ct. 313; Dorrance v. Pennsylvania, \n287 \nU.S. 660\n, 53 S.Ct. 222; Hill v. Martin, \n296 \nU.S. 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 278, although he could not be domiciled in both; that neither state could constitutionally authorize its officials to impose the tax if decedent was last domiciled elsewhere, and petitioner is thus exposed to the danger of double taxation, which the Constitution forbids. See First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S. Ct. 174, 77 A.L.R. 1401; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000. As those officials threaten acts whose consequence may be taxation which is unauthorized by any valid state enactment, petitioner in- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n sists that the suit brought to restrain such action does not run against the state.\n But this argument confuses the possibility of conflict of decisions of the courts of the two states, which the Constitution does not forestall, with other types of action by state officers which, because it passes beyond the limits of a lawful authority, is within the reach of the federal judicial power, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment. This Court has held that state statutes, construed to impose death taxes upon the intangibles of decedents domiciled elsewhere, infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, and it has accordingly reversed judgments of state courts enforcing such liability. First National Bank v. Maine, supra; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supra. But petitioner does not assert that there are such statutes in California or Massachusetts, or that the courts in those states have ever held or threaten to hold that their laws taxing inheritances apply to intangibles of those domiciled in other states.\n Although the bill of complaint states that respondents California officials 'have determined' that decedent was domiciled in California, it is not contended that they have or are assuming authority to assess the tax, independently of the judgment of a court. Under California statutes, inheritance taxes are assessed by judicial proceedings resulting, after full opportunity for presentation of evidence and a hearing, in a judgment which is reviewable on appeal by the state courts, and by this Court if it involves any denial of federal right. Sections 14, 15, 17 and 18, Cal. Inheritance Tax Act of June 3, 1921, Stats.1921, pp. 1500, 1514, 1515, 1517-1520, and section 16, as amended by St.1929 p. 1848; see Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 44 A.L.R. 1454; Estate of Haskins, 170 Cal. 267, 149 P. 576; Estate of Brown, 196 Cal. 114, 236 P. 144.\n Petitioner does not contend that respondents, the California officers, propose to do more than invoke the action \n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n of its courts to assess a lawful tax and to seek there a judicial determination that decedent was domiciled in California as the basis of its power to impose the tax. Nor is it denied that in so doing they are acting in the performance of official duty imposed upon them by state statutes, which conform to all constitutional requirements. Petitioner's real concern is that the judgment of the California court, if it should decide that decedent was domiciled there, may be erroneous or may conflict with that of the Massachusetts courts. But conflicting decisions upon the same issue of fact do not necessarily connote erroneous judicial action. Differences in proof and the latitude necessarily allowed to the trier of fact in each case to weigh and draw inferences from evidence and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses, might lead an appellate court to conclude that in none is the judgment erroneous. In any case the Constitution of the United States does not guarantee that the decision of state courts shall be free from error, Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103\n, 16 S.Ct. 80; Tracy v. Ginzberg, \n205 \nU.S. 170\n, 27 S.Ct. 461; or require that pronouncements shall be consistent. Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co. v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, 40 S.Ct. 306, 309, 10 A.L.R. 892. Neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the full faith and credit clause (article 4,  1) requires uniformity in the decisions of the courts of different states as to the place of domicil, where the exertion of state power is dependent upon domicil within its boundaries. Thormann v. Frame, \n176 \nU.S. 350\n, 20 S.Ct. 446; Overby v. Gordon, \n177 \nU.S. 214\n, 20 S.Ct. 603; Burbank v. Ernst, \n232 \nU.S. 162\n, 34 S.Ct. 299; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394\n, 37 S.Ct. 152; Iowa v. Slimmer, \n248 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 121 S., 39 S.Ct. 33; cf. Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43\n, 28 S.Ct. 1. Hence it cannot be said that the threatened action of respondents involves any breach of state law or of the laws or Constitution of the United States. Since the proposed action is the performance of a duty imposed by the statute of the state upon state officials through whom alone \n\n[302 \nU.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n the state can act, restraint of their action, which the bill of complaint prays, is restraint of state action, and the suit is in substance one against the state which the Eleventh Amendment forbids. We do not pass on the construction of the Interpleader Act or its applicability in other respects.\n Unlike that in Ex parte Young, supra, and in the many cases which have followed it, the present suit is not founded on the asserted unconstitutionality of any state statute and the consequent want of lawful authority for official action taken under it. In City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24\n, 54 S.Ct. 259, on which petitioner relies, it was held that the bill of complaint stated a cause of action in equity to enjoin a state official from proceeding to assess and collect an inheritance tax upon chattels alleged to have no tax situs within the state. The objection that the suit was one against the state within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment was not urged or considered on the appeal to this Court.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWRIGHT V.

Parsons, of Roanoke, Va., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question for decision is whether section 75, subsection (s), of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the new \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 454]\n\u00a0\n Frazier-Lemke Act, August 28, 1935, c. 792, 49 Stat. 943-945, 11 \nU.S.C.A.  203(s), is constitutional. In this case, the federal court for Western Virginia (see In re Sherman (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 297) and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (85 F.(2d) 973) held it invalid. Like decisions have been rendered in other circuits. Lafayette Life Insurance Co. v. Lowmon, 79 F.(2d) 887 (C.C.A.Seventh Circuit); United States National Bank of Omaha v. Pamp, 83 F.(2d) 493 (C.C.A.Eighth Circuit). In the Fifth Circuit the legislation was sustained. Dallas Joint Stock Land Bank v. Davis (C.C.A.) 83 F.(2d) 322. Because of this conflict and the importance of the question, we granted certiorari. \n299 \nU.S. 537\n.1\n  Wright, a Virginia farmer, gave in 1929 a mortgage deed of trust of his farm to secure a debt now held by the Vinton Branch of the Mountain Trust Bank. In March, 1935, he filed a petitioner under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 455]\n\u00a0\n When the proceedings were begun, the debt secured by the deed of trust had matured and was in default, and the trustee, at the request of the beneficiary, had advertised the property for sale pursuant to the terms of the deed of trust and the provisions of the Virginia Code. The debtor's petition prayed, among other things, 'that all proceedings against him by way of pending and advertised foreclosures of his farming lands, or by other methods contrary to the provisions' of the Act be stayed. The petition, 'appearing to be in proper form and to have been filed in good faith,' was referred to the Conciliation Commissioner as required by section 75, 11 \nU.S.C.A.  203. On July 27, 1935, the debtor made a proposal for composition; but it was not accepted by the mortgage creditor. On October 8, 1935, Wright filed an amended petition under subsection (s) of section 75 as amended by the new Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 \nU.S.C.A.  203(s ); and asked to be adjudged a bankrupt and to have all the benefits of the provisions of said subsection (s) as so amended and approved August 28, 1935.\n  An order was entered adjudging Wright a bankrupt and again referring the matter to the Conciliation Commissioner. Thereafter, the Vinton Branch of the Mountain Trust Bank moved in the District Court that the proceedings before the Commissioner be terminated and 'that this case be dismissed upon the ground that subsection (s) of said Act is unconstitutional in that it deprives said creditor of its property without due process of law and that the debtor is not entitled to pursue the remedies and privileges granted therein.' On January 8, 1936, that motion was granted; all proceedings on the bankrupt's petition were terminated; and his petition was dismissed. It is that order, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which is here for review. Both of the lower courts held that, since the applicable rights of a mortgagee in Kentucky and of the beneficiary under a mortgage deed of trust in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 456]\n\u00a0\n Virginia are substantially the same, our decision in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 97\n A.L.R. 1106, required that subsection (s) be held unconstitutional.\n  First. The mortgagee claims that the legislation is void on its face. It challenges the power of Congress to confer upon courts authority to grant to a mortgagor, under any circumstances, any of the relief provided for in subsection (s) of the new Frazier-Lemke Act. There has been no order granting a stay under paragraph 2 of subsection (s). But the suit is not premature; for the fact that no stay order has been entered does not imply that an actual constitutional controversy is not presented. The petitioner asserts a right to pursue proceedings provided by a federal statute, and that right has been denied him on grounds of the alleged invalidity of the statute. Before the motion to dismiss was made, the District Court had entered its order adjudging petitioner a bankrupt, and referring the matter to the Conciliation Commissioner for further proceedings under section 75(s). The entry of the order of reference initiated proceedings designed to move, through the appointment of appraisers, the appraisal, and the referee's order recognizing the debtor's right to possession, to the grant of the stay by the court. Under the Act no further affirmative action by petitioner precedent to his obtaining the stay was necessary. The mortgagee was not obliged to delay his challenge to the validity of the stay and its essential incidents until these officials had complied with the mandatory provisions of the Act. But while we must decide whether the challenged sub-section is constitutional, we refrain from deciding questions suggested which may arise later in the course of its administration.\n  Second. The decision in the Radford Case did not question the power of Congress to offer to distressed farmers the aid of a means of rehabilitation under the bankruptcy clause. The original Frazier-Lemke Act was there held invalid solely on the ground that the bankruptcy power of \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 457]\n\u00a0\n Congress, like its other great powers, is subject to the Fifth Amendment; and that, as applied to mortgages given before its enactment, the statute violated that Amendment, since it effected a substantial impairment of the mortgagee's security. The opinion enumerates five important substantive rights in specific property which had been taken. It was not held that the deprivation of any one of these rights would have rendered the Act invalid, but that the effect of the statute in its entirety was to deprive the mortgagee of his property without due process of law. The rights enumerated were (\n295 \nU.S. 555\n, at pages 594, 595, 865, 97 A.L.R. 1106):\n  (1) The right to retain the lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid.\n'(2) The right to realize upon the security by a judicial public sale.\n\n'(3) The right to determine when such sale shall be held, subject only to the discretion of the court.\n\n'(4) The right to protect its interest in the property by bidding at such sale whenever held, and thus to assure having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt, either through receipt of the proceeds of a fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself.\n\n'(5) The right to control meanwhile the property during the period of default, subject only to the discretion of the court, and to have the rents and profits collected by a receiver for the satisfaction of the debt.'\n\n  In drafting the new Frazier-Lemke Act, its framers sought to preserve to the mortgagee all of these rights so far as essential to the enjoyment of his security. The measure received careful consideration before the committees of the House and the Senate. Amendments were made there with a view to ensuring the constitutionality of the legislation recommended. The Congress concluded, after full discussion, that the bill, as enacted, was free from the objectionable features which had been held fatal to the original Act. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 458]\n\u00a0\n  Third. It is not denied that the new Act adequately preserves three of the five above enumerated rights of a mortgagee. 'The right to retain the lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid' is specifically covered by the provisions in paragraph 1, that the debtor's possession, 'under the supervision and control of the court,' shall be 'subject to all existing mortgages, liens, pledges, or encumbrances,' and that: 'All such existing mortgages, liens, pledges, or encumbrances shall remain in full force and effect, and the property covered by such mortgages, liens, pledges, or encumbrances shall be subject to the payment of the claims of the secured creditors, as their interests may appear.'2\n'The right to realize upon the security by a judicial public sale' is covered by the provision in paragraph 3 that at the termination of the stay: \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 459]\n\u00a0\n '* * * upon request in writing by any secured creditor or creditors, the court shall order the property upon which such secured creditors have a lien to be sold at public auction.'3\n\n  The new Act does not in terms provide for 'The right to protect its ( the mortgagee's) interest in the property by bidding at such sale whenever held.' But the committee reports and the explanations given in Congress make it plain that the mortgagee was intended to have this right. \n4\n We accept this view of the statute. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 460]\n\u00a0\n  Fourth. The claim that subsection (s) is unconstitutional rests mainly upon the contention that the Act denies to a mortgagee the 'right to determine when such sale shall be held, subject only to the discretion of the court.' The assertion is that the new Act in effect gives to the mortgagor the absolute right to a three-year stay; and that a three-year moratorium cannot be justified. The three-year stay is specified in the following provisions:\n'When the conditions set forth in this section (Section 75) have been complied with, the court shall stay all judicial or official proceedings in any court, or under the direction of any official, against the debtor or any of his property, for a period of three years.' Par. 2.\n\n'At the end of three years, or prior thereto, the debtor may pay into court, the amount of the appraisal of the property of which he retains possession, including the amount of encumbrances on his exemptions, up to the amount of the appraisal, less the amount paid on principal.' Par. 3.5\n\n  Whether, in view of the emergency, an absolute stay of three years would have been justified under the bankruptcy power, we have no occasion to decide. There are \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 461]\n\u00a0\n other provisions in the statute affecting the mortgagor's right to possession. Their phraseology is lacking in clarity. But we are of opinion that, while the Act affords the debtor, ordinarily, a three-year period of rehabilitation, the stay provided for is not an absolute one; and that the court may terminate the stay and order a sale earlier.\n  If we were in doubt as to the intention of Congress, we should still be led to that construction by a well-settled rule: 'When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.' Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 62\n, 296.\n  The mortgagor's right to retain possession during the stay is specifically limited by paragraph 3, which provides: 'If, however, the debtor at any time fails to comply with the provisions of this section, or with any orders of the court made pursuant to this section, or is unable to refinance himself within three years, the court may order the appointment of a trustee, and order the property sold or otherwise disposed of as provided for in this Act (title).'\n  Thus, for example, the debtor's tenure under the stay is subject to the requirement that he pay 'a reasonable rental semiannually for that part of the property of which he retains possession.' Paragraph 2. Under the last-quoted provision of paragraph 3, if the debtor defaults in this obligation 'at any time,' the court may thereupon order the property sold. Likewise, the property while in the debtor's possession is kept, according to paragraph 2, at all times 'in the custody and under the supervision and control of the court'; and, also under paragraph 2: 'The court, in its discretion, if it deems it necessary to protect the creditors from loss by the estate, and\/or to \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 462]\n\u00a0\n conserve the security, * * * may, in addition to the rental, require payments on the principal due and owing by the debtor to the secured or unsecured creditors, as their interests may appear, in accordance with the provisions of this Act (title), and may require such payments to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, not inconsistent with the protection of the rights of the creditors and the debtor's ability to pay, with a view to his financial rehabilitation.'\n  Paragraph 3 authorizes the court to have the property sold if 'at any time' the debtor should fail to comply with orders of the court issued under its power to require interim payments on principal, or otherwise in the course of its 'supervision and control' of his possession. Paragraph 3 also provides that 'if * * * the debtor at any time * * * is unable to refinance himself within three years,' the court may close the proceedings by selling the property. This clause must be interpreted as meaning that the court may terminate the stay if after a reasonable time it becomes evident that there si no reasonable hope that the debtor can rehabilitate himself within the three-year period. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n  Finally, the intention of Congress to make the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 463]\n\u00a0\n stay terminable by the court within the three years is shown also by paragraph 6, which declares the Act (11 \nU.S.C.A.  203(s)(6) an emergency measure, and provides that: 'if in the judgment of the court such emergency ceases to exist in its locality, then the court, in its discretion, may shorten the stay of proceedings herein provided for and proceed to liquidate the estate.'7\n  Since the language of the Act is not free from doubt in the particulars mentioned, we are justified in seeking enlightenment from reports of Congressional committees and explanations given on the floor of the Senate and House by those in charge of the measure. \n8\n When the leg- \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 464]\n\u00a0\n islative history of the bill is thus surveyed, it becomes clear that to construe the Act otherwise than as giving the courts broad power to curtail the stay for the protection of the mortgagee would be inconsistent not only with provisions of the Act, but with the committee reports and with the exposition of the bill made in both Houses by its authors and those in charge of the bill and accepted by the Congress without dissent. \n9\n We construe it as giving the courts such power. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 465]\n\u00a0\n  Fifth. It is urged that subsection (s) is unconstitutional because there is taken from the mortgagee' the right to control meanwhile the property during the period of default, subject only to the discretion of the court, \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 466]\n\u00a0\n and to have the rents and profits collected by a receiver for the satisfaction of the debt.'\n  (a) The argument is that possession by the mortgagor during the stay is necessarily less favorable to the mortgagee than possession by a receiver or trustee would be. This is not true. The mortgagor is in default, but it is not therefore to be assumed that he is a wrongdoer, or incompetent to conduct farming operations. The legislation is designed to aid victims of the general economic depression. The mortgagor is familiar with the property, and presumably vitally interested in preserving ownership thereof and ready to exert himself to the uttermost to that end. It is not unreasonable to assume that, under these circumstances, the interests of all concerned will be better served by leaving him in possession than by installing a disinterested receiver or trustee. For the mortgagor holds possession charged with obligations imposed for the benefit of the mortgagee as fully as if the property were in the possession of a receiver or trustee, and there is probably a saving of expense. In order to protect the creditor's interests, the possession is at all times subject to the supervision and control of the court; and, if the debtor, 'at any time,' fails to comply with orders of the \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 467]\n\u00a0\n court issued in the exercise of its supervisory power to protect the mortgagee against waste or other abuse of his possession by the mortgagor, the court may order the property sold. The farmer's proceeding in bankruptcy for rehabilitation, resembles that of a corporation for reorganization. As to the latter it is expressly provided that the debtor may, to some extent, be left in possession, U.S.Code, Title 11,  207(c), 11 \nU.S.C.A.  207(c); and it is common practice to appoint as receivers one of the officials of the corporation.\n  (b) It is complained that the mortgagor is not required to pay the first instalment of rent until the end of one year. The phraseology of the applicable provision is not clear. Paragraph 2, section 75(s), provides: 'During such three years the debtor shall be permitted to retain possession of all or any part of his property, in the custody and under the supervision and control of the court, provided the pays a reasonable rental semiannually for that part of the property of which he retains possession. The first payment of such rental shall be made within one year of the date of the order staying proceedings, the amount and kind of such rental to be the usual customary rental in the community where the property is located, based upon the rental value, net income, and earning capacity of the property.'\n  The clause providing that 'the first payment of such rental shall be made within one year' is obviously capable of either of two constructions: One, that the mortgagor may not be required by the court to pay before the close of the year. The other, that the court may not postpone the payment beyond one year. In view of the requirement of semi-annual rental, the latter seems to us more reasonable. We intimate no opinion as to the validity of this provision under the first construction. As here construed, the clause cannot be deemed arbitrary or unreasonable. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 468]\n\u00a0\n  (c) The disposition of the rental required to be made is said to involve denial of the mortgagee's rights. Paragraph 2 provides: 'Such rental shall be paid into court, to be used, first, for payment of taxes and upkeep of the property, and the remainder to be distributed among the secured and unsecured creditors, and applied on their claims, as their interests may appear.'\n  It is suggested that payment of taxes and keeping the property in repair takes the income from the mortgagee, and that the mortgagor alone may be benefited thereby; that if the mortgagor exercises the option to purchase the property at its appraised value, he will secure the property free of tax liens which otherwise might have accrued against it. But it must be assumed that the mortgagor will not get the property for less than its actual value. The Act provides that upon the creditor's request the property must be reappraised, or sold at public auction and the mortgagee may by bidding at such sale fully protect his interest. Nonpayment of taxes may imperil the title. Payments for upkeep are essential to the preservation of the property. These payments prescribed by the Act are in accordance with the common practice in foreclosure proceedings where the property is in the hands of receivers. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n  Sixth. In support of the contention that the legislation is unconstitutional, it is pointed out that the delay in the enforcement of the mortgage under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended by subsection (s) may exceed the term of three years; that months may be consumed in \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 469]\n\u00a0\n the effort to obtain a composition or extension of the debtor's obligations with the consent of the creditors; that when a petition is filed praying for the relief outlined in subsection (s) a further period of months may be consumed in having the property appraised and putting the debtor in the position which he must occupy before the stay is granted; that 'four months from the date that the referee approves the appraisal' is given within which 'either party may file objections, exceptions, and take appeals' from the appraisal; and that upon a sale of the property under paragraph 3: 'The debtor shall have ninety days to redeem any property sold at such sale, by paying the amount for which any such property was sold, together with 5 per centum per annum interest, into court.' It is pointed out, also, that the mortgage here in question is in the form of a deed of trust. \n11\n It is claimed that the rights to enforce payment by sale of the mortgage property, conferred by the law of Virginia upon the creditor under such a deed, are more peremptory than those under the law of Kentucky discussed in the Radford Case. \n12\n And it is urged that the limitations here placed upon the enforcement of the mortgage are not merely a modification of the remedy recognized as permissible. Compare Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 434\n, 238, 88 A.L.R. 1481. \n\n[300 \nU.S. 440\n, 470]\n\u00a0\n  But the question here involved is not one of state action under the police power alleged to violate the contract clause. The power here exerted by Congress is the broad power 'To establish * * * uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.' (Const. art. 1 ,  8, cl. 4.) The question which the objections raise is not whether the Act does more than modify remedial rights. It is whether the legislation modifies the secured creditor's rights, remedial or substantive, to such an extent as to deny the due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. A court of bankruptcy may affect the interests of lienholders in many ways. To carry out the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, it may direct that all liens upon property forming part of a bankrupt's estate be marshaled; or that the property be sold free of encumbrances and the rights of all lienholders be transferred to the proceeds of the sale. Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, \n284 \nU.S. 225, 227\n, 116, 78 A.L.R. 453. Despite the peremptory terms of a pledge, it may enjoin sale of the collateral, if it finds that the sale would hinder or delay preparation or consummation of a plan of reorganization. Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 680\n, 681, 608. It may enjoin like action by a mortgagee which would defeat the purpose of subsection (s) to effect rehabilitation of the farmer mortgagor. For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the provisions of subsection (s) make no unreasonable modification of the mortgagee's rights; and hence are valid.\n  Reversed. \nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Opinion of Supreme Court conformed to in Nichols v.

Compare In re Shonkwiler, 17 F.Supp. 697, 699 (E.D.Ill.). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Amendments to the bill subsequent to its introduction plainly demonstrate careful intention to leave the lien wholly unimpaired. As introduced, the measure provided for retention of the lien 'up to the actual value of such property, as fixed by the appraisals provided for in this section,' S. 3002,  6, p. 6 (Compare Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, subsec. (s), (2), 48 Stat. 1290); and there was no provision for a public sale at the request of the secured creditor. As reported out of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and as subsequently enacted, the measure provided for retention of the lien unqualified by reference to the appraisal value of the property. See S. 3002, as reported,  6, p. 6; Sen. Rep. No. 985, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. As reported by the committee, the bill provided for a public sale in the discretion of the court, upon request of the secured creditor, and limited the lienholder's bid at such sale to 'the appraised value or the original principal, whichever is the higher.' S. 3002, supra,  6, p. 9; Sen. Rep. No. 985, supra, pp. 4, 6. Since the later qualification was thought to raise some constitutional doubt, it was eliminated during the Senate's consideration of the measure. See statements of Senators Ashurst and Borah, of the Committee on the Judiciary, and of Senator Frazier, 79 Cong.Rec. 13413, 13633, 13634, 13641. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill with this change. H. R. Rep. No. 1808, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1, 4, 6. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] As introduced, S. 3002 contained the provision of the Act by which the mortgagor might purchase at the appraised value, subject to the mortgagee's right to require a re-appraisal; but it did not provide that the mortgagee might, in lieu of a re-appraisal, have a public sale. The bill as reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary inserted after the provision for appraisal a clause providing, 'That upon request in writing by any secured creditor or creditors, the court, in its discretion, if it deems it for the best interests of the secured creditors and debtor, may order the property upon which such secured creditors have a lien, to be sold at public auction; * * *' S. 3002, as reported,  6, p. 9; See Sen. Rep. No. 985, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. 'To remove a question as to the constitutionality of the bill,' this provision was altered in the course of the bill's passage through the House to deprive the court of discretion in the matter and to give the secured creditor an unqualified right to a public sale as the alternative to a transfer of the property to the debtor at the re-appraised value. See remarks of Representative Sumners, of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 79 Cong.Rec. 14332, 14333.  \n[\nFootnote 4\n] As reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, S. 3002,  6, p. 9, recognized a right in the mortgagee to bid at the sale not in excess 'of the appraised value or the original principal, whichever is the higher.' See Sen. Rep. No. 985, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 4, 6. In striking out this qualification for the express purpose of avoiding a constitutional doubt, Senators responsible for the measure plainly showed that they had no intention of raising a further constitutional controversy by questioning the mortgagee's unqualified right to bid. See statements of Senators Ashurst, Borah, and Frazier, 79 Cong.Rec. 13413, 13633, 13634, 13641, 13642. H.R. Rep. No. 1808, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1, 5, 6, unequivocally declared that under the Act the secured creditors have the right to bid at the sale; and this was made clear on the floor of the House by Representative Sumners, of the Committee on the Judiciary. See 79 Cong.Rec. 14333.\n  The beneficiary under a mortgage deed of trust in Virginia is permitted to bid in the property at the sale. See, e.g., Ashworth v. Tramwell, 102 Va. 852, 858, 47 S.E. 1011; Title Insurance Co. of Richmond, Inc., v. Industrial Bank of Richmond, Inc., 156 Va. 322, 327, 157 S.E. 710; Everette v. Woodward, 162 Va. 419, 174 S.E. 864. Compare Easton v. German- American Bank, \n127 \nU.S. 532, 538\n. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This clause is qualified by alternative provisos, one for payment at a reappraised value, the other for a public sale to be held upon the mortgagee's request at the time when the stay expires, whether by lapse of time or by the mortgagor's payment into court of the appraised or reappraised value. See Note 3, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This construction is in harmony with the requirement of good faith in the initiation of proceedings under section 75. Relief under section 75 ( s) may be obtained only by one who has made a bona fide attempt, and has failed, to effect a composition under section 75, (a) to (r), 11 \nU.S.C.A.  203(ar). The offer of composition must be in good faith (section 75, (c), ( i), 47 Stat. 1471, 1472), and if the debtor is beyond all reasonable hope of financial rehabilitation, and the proceedings under section 75 cannot be expected to have any effect beyond postponing inevitable liquidation, the proceedings will be halted at the outset. The practical administration of section 75 in the lower courts already affords ample evidence of the substantial protection afforded the creditor by this requirement of good faith in the initiation of proceedings under subsections (a)-(r). See In re Borgelt (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 929; Dallas Joint Stock Land Bank v. Davis ( C.C.A.) 83 F.(2d) 322, 323; Steverson v. Clark (C.C.A.) 86 F.(2d) 330; Knotts v.

It must be assumed that the situation of the present debtor was not beyond all reasonable hope of rehabilitation, else he could not have qualified to file his petition at the outset. Compare Tennessee Publishing Co. v. American National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 18, 22\n. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This provision is not inconsistent with the constitutional requirement that laws established by Congress on the subject of bankruptcies shall be uniform throughout the United States. Article 1,  8, cl. 4. The problem dealt with may present significant variations in different parts of the country. By paragraph 6 the Bankruptcy Act adjusts its operation to these variations, as under other provisions it has adjusted its operation to the differing laws of the several States affecting dower, exemptions, and other property rights. Compare Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181, 189\n; Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605, 613\n. The authority granted by paragraph 6 does not exceed limits of authority familiarly exercised by courts. See Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 69\n, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; compare Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n.  \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Where the meaning of legislation is doubtful or obscure, resort may be had in its interpretation to reports of Congressional committees which have considered the measure (McLean v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 374, 380\n; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 435\n, 223); to exposition of the bill on the floor of Congress by those in charge of or sponsoring the legislation (Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 475\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 179, 16 A.L.R. 196; Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 528, 536\n, 388, 73 A.L.R. 1081); to comparison of successive drafts or amendments of the measure ( United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547, 551\n, 570; United States v. Great Northern Railway Co., \n287 \nU.S. 144, 155\n, 53 S. Ct. 28, 32); and to the debates in general in order to show common agreement on purpose as distinguished from interpretation of particular phraseology (Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 650\n, 590, 79 A.L.R. 1191; Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 625\n, 872). \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Emphasis upon the deliberate intention to meet the constitutional objections raised in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 97\n A.L.R. 1106, dominated the consideration of the bill in all stages. See, e.g., Sen.Rep. No. 985, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1, 3; H.R. Rep. No. 1808, id., pp. 1, 3; statements of Senator McCarran, 79 Cong.Rec. 11971; Senator Ashurst, ibid.; Senator Borah, id., 13411, 13632, 13642; Representative Lemke, id., 14331, 14332; and Representative Sumners, id., 14333. There was no dissent on constitutional grounds apart from the doubts which were disposed of as described in notes 2, 3, and 4, supra. Comparing the present measure with the former section 75(s), Sen.Rep. No. 985, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5, pointed out that: 'The amended subsection (s) shortens the time of the stay of proceedings from 5 to 3 years, and * * * gives the court power to shorten that stay. It gives the court complete jurisdiction and custody of the property, with authority to fix the rental annually, and to sell perishable property and personal property that is not necessary for the debtor's farming operations. It will also be noticed that the court can require payments over and above the rental value. In other words, in the amended subsection (s), the property is virtually in the complete custody and control of the court, for all purposes of liquidation. * * *' Likewise, it was said in H.R.Rep. No. 1808, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5, that: 'The new subsection (s) shortens the time of the stay of proceedings from 5 to 3 years, and in addition gives the court power to shorten that period . * * * Under the new subsection (s) the property of the bankrupt is in the complete custody and control of the court, for all the purposes of liquidation.' And at page 6: 'The Supreme Court intimated that in the original subsection, the district court did not have sufficient discretion. In this subsection, the district court is given complete control and discretion.'\n  Discussion of the bill in the Senate is reported in 79 Cong.Rec. 11970, 11971, 13348, 13349, 13411, 13413, 13632, 13645.\n  In the Senate discussion there occurred the following (79 Cong.Rec. 13633):\n'Mr. Borah. The court is given power in the bill to make sale of the property whenever the court deems it in the interest of all parties to do so.\n\n'Mr. Hastings. During the 3 years?\n\n'Mr. Borah. Yes. In the case of perishable property, or property which is not bringing in any income, or anything of that kind, the court has power to make sale of it.\n\n'* * * \n\n  'Mr. Frazier. The bill gives the court authority to sell the property, if it deems it advisable, at any time. The court may sell any part of it or all of it at any time before or during or after the 3 years.'\n  Discussion of the bill in the House is reported in 79 Cong.Rec. 13831, 14331, 14334. Presenting the bill, as reported from committee, Representative Lloyd explained: 'We have in no way reduced the security of the mortgagee. We have left his security intact, but we have made it possible for the bankruptcy court to retain jurisdiction for a period not to exceed 3 years.' 79 Cong.Rec. 13831.\n  There also occurred in the House the following (79 Cong.Rec. 14332):\n'Mr. Ford of California. Is it not designed to give to the farmer a breathing spell so that he may orient himself in such a way as to get out of his present difficulties without in the least jeopardizing the lien of his creditors?\n\n'Mr. Lemke. Absolutely, and the district judge has complete control all the time of the farmer's property.\n\n'* * *mke\n\n'Mr. Andresen. All it does is to give a 3-year extension for the time of the redemption if the court so directs.\n\n'Mr. Lemke. Under the supervision and control of the court.'\n\n  Despite some apparent similarity of language, the remarks quoted from the discussion in the Senate do not seem to have been addressed to the second proviso of paragraph 3 as it then stood, but to have been intended more generally, expressing the plan embodied in the last sentence of paragraph 3.
