Maats., is also granted.\n\nWe believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the judgment for petitioner Albanese on the ground that the trial court incorrectly charged the jury on the issue of negligence is erroneous. Gutierrez v. Waterman S. S. Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 206\n. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn its opinion the Court of Appeals also stated that the District Court incorrectly instructed the jury as to the applicability of the Safety and Health Regulations for LongshoringFn on the question of the shipowner's liability. But we do not read that court's opinion as making this an independent ground for ordering a new trial. So we not only reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the case of Albanese but reinstate the District Court's judgment in his favor.\n\nThe petitions in No. 557, International Terminal Operating Co. v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats.; and No. 654, N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats. v. Albanese, are denied.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN would have denied certiorari in No. 523, Albanese v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats., but the writ having been granted, he would have set the issues for plenary consideration. He concurs in the denial of certiorari in No. 557, International Terminal Operating Co. v. N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats., and No. 654, N. V. Nederl. Amerik Stoomv. Maats. v. Albanese.\n\n Fn \n\n[382 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n 29 CFR 9.1 et seq.

SACB(1965)\nNo. IS-52\nArgued: October 18, 1965Decided: November 15, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Despite the order of the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB), sustained in Communist Party of the United States v. SACB, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n, the Party failed to register under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and no list of members was filed. The Attorney General, in accordance with 13 (a) and 8 (a) and (c) of the Act, asked the SACB to order petitioners, as Party members, to register and submit a registration statement. The SACB did order petitioners to register and submit the registration statement and the Court of Appeals affirmed these orders, finding the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue not ripe for adjudication. Held:\n\n 1. Petitioners' claims of the privilege against self-incrimination are ripe for adjudication. Pp. 73-77.\n\n\n  (a) As distinguished from the Communist Party case, the contingencies upon which the members' duty to register arises have matured, the petitioners have claimed the privilege and the Attorney General has rejected such claims. Pp. 74-75.\n\n\n  (b) Petitioners are faced with the choice of registering without a decision on the merits of their claims or subjecting themselves to serious punishment. Pp. 75-76.\n\n\n  (c) Respondent's attempt to distinguish between claims of privilege relating to the SACB's power to compel registration and submission of a registration statement, concerning which it concedes that the Court of Appeals' holding of prematurity was erroneous, and claims of privilege against \"any particular inquiry\" on the registration form or registration statement, is without merit. The statute and regulations issued thereunder require petitioners to register and submit the forms fully executed in accordance with present regulations. Pp. 76-77.\n\n\n 2. The requirement of filing the registration form (IS-52a) is incriminatory within the meaning of the Self-Incrimination Clause because the admission of Party membership, required by the form, might be used as an investigatory lead to or evidence in a criminal prosecution. Pp. 77-78. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 71]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 3. The requirement of completing and filing the registration statement (IS-52), considered apart from the registration form, would also be incriminatory because the information might be used as evidence in or supply leads to a criminal prosecution. United States v. Sullivan, \n274 \nU.S. 259\n, distinguished. Pp. 78-79.\n\n\n 4. The Act's immunity provision, 4 (f), does not save the orders to register from petitioners' Fifth Amendment challenge. Pp. 79-81.\n\n\n  (a) The immunity provision does not preclude the use of information called for by the registration statement (IS-52), either as evidence or an investigatory lead. P. 80.\n\n\n  (b) The immunity provision does not preclude the use of an admission of Party membership on the registration form (IS-52a) as an investigatory lead, a use barred by the self-incrimination privilege. P. 80.\n\n\n  (c) Respondent's argument that since an order to register follows an SACB finding of Party membership, the admission of Party membership by registering is of no investigatory value and thus not \"incriminatory,\" would make the right to invoke the privilege depend upon an assessment of information in the Government's possession. This would negate the complete protection from all perils that an immunity statute must provide according to Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n. P. 81.\n\n\n 118 U.S. App. D.C. 117, 332 F.2d 317, reversed.\n\nJohn J. Abt argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was Joseph Forer.\n\nKevin T. Maroney argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Marshall, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley, Nathan Lewin, George B. Searls and Lee B. Anderson.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae were filed by Osmond K. Fraenkel for the American Civil Liberties Union, and by Ernest Goodman for the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Communist Party of the United States of America failed to register with the Attorney General as required by the order of the Subversive Activities Control Board \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n sustained in Communist Party of the United States v. SACB, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n.\n1\n Accordingly, no list of Party members was filed as required by 7 (d) (4) of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 993-994, 50 U.S.C. 786 (d) (4) (1964 ed.).\n2\n Sections 8 (a) and (c) of the Act provide that, in that circumstance, each member of the organization must register and file a registration statement; in default thereof, 13 (a) authorizes the Attorney General to petition the Board for an order requiring the member to register.\n3\n The \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General invoked 13 (a) against petitioners, and the Board, after evidentiary hearings, determined that petitioners were Party members and ordered each of them to register pursuant to 8 (a) and (c). Review of the orders was sought by petitioners in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under 14 (a).\n4\n The Court of Appeals affirmed the orders, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 117, 332 F.2d 317. We granted certiorari, \n381 \nU.S. 910\n. We reverse.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\nI.\n\n\nPetitioners address several constitutional challenges to the validity of the orders, but we consider only the contention \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n that the orders violate their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the orders without deciding the privilege issue, expressing the view that under our decision in Communist Party, \n367 \nU.S., at 105\n-110, the issue was not ripe for adjudication and would be ripe only in a prosecution for failure to register if the petitioners did not register. 118 U.S. App. D.C., at 121-123, 332 F.2d, at 321-323. We disagree. In Communist Party the Party asserted the privilege on behalf of unnamed officers - those obliged to register the Party and those obliged \"to register for\" the Party if it failed to do so.\n7\n The self-incrimination claim asserted on behalf of the latter officers was held premature because the Party might choose to register and thus the duty of those officers might never arise. Here, in contrast, the contingencies upon which the members' duty to register arises have already matured; the Party did not register within 30 days after the order to register became final and the requisite 60 days since the order became final have elapsed. As to the officers obliged to register the Party, Communist Party held that the self-incrimination claim asserted on their behalf was not ripe for adjudication because \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n it was not known whether they would ever claim the privilege or whether the claim, if asserted, would be honored by the Attorney General. But with respect to the orders in this case, addressed to named individuals, both these contingencies are foreclosed. Petitioners asserted the privilege in their answers to the Attorney General's petitions; they did not testify at the Board hearings; they again asserted the privilege in the review proceedings in the Court of Appeals. In each instance the Attorney General rejected their claims. Thus, the considerations which led the Court in Communist Party to hold that the claims on behalf of unnamed officers were premature are not present in this case.\n\nThere are other reasons for holding that petitioners' self-incrimination claims are ripe for decision. Specific orders requiring petitioners to register have been issued. The Attorney General has promulgated regulations requiring that registration shall be accomplished on Form IS-52a and that the accompanying registration statement shall be a completed Form IS-52,\n8\n 28 CFR 11.206, 11.207, and petitioners risk very heavy penalties if they fail to register by completing and filing these forms. Under 15 (a) (2) of the Act, 64 Stat. 1002, 50 U.S.C. 794 (a) (2), for example, each day of failure to register constitutes a separate offense punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to five years, or both.\n9\n Petitioners must either register without a decision on the merits of their privilege claims, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 76]\n\u00a0\n or fail to register and risk onerous and rapidly mounting penalties while awaiting the Government's pleasure whether to initiate a prosecution against them. To ask, in these circumstances, that petitioners await such a prosecution for an adjudication of their self-incrimination claims is, in effect, to contend that they should be denied the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege intended to relieve claimants of the necessity of making a choice between incriminating themselves and risking serious punishments for refusing to do so.\n\nIndeed the Government concedes in its brief in this Court that the Court of Appeals' holding of prematurity was erroneous insofar as petitioners' claims of privilege relate to the Board's power to compel the act of registration and the submission of an accompanying registration statement. The brief candidly acknowledges that, since 14 (b) provides for judicial review of a Board order to register, petitioners' claims in that regard, like any other contention that an order is invalid, may be heard and determined by the reviewing court - thus distinguishing orders that are not similarly reviewable, see Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117\n; Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323\n. Nevertheless, the Government argues that petitioners' claims are premature insofar as they relate to \"any particular inquiry\" on Forms IS-52a and IS-52. Two contingencies are hypothesized in support of this contention: (1) that the Attorney General might alter the present forms or (2) that he might accept less than fully completed forms.\n\nThe distinction upon which this argument is predicated is illusory. Neither the statute nor the regulations draw any distinction between the act of registering and the submission of a registration statement, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the answering of the inquiries demanded by the forms; the statute and regulations contemplate rather that the questions asked on the forms \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n are to be fully and completely answered. Morever, the contingencies hypothesized are irrelevant. Petitioners are obliged to register and to submit registration forms in accordance with presently existing regulations; the mere contingency that the Attorney General might revise the regulations at some future time does not render premature their challenge to the existing requirements. Nor can these requirements be viewed as requiring that petitioners answer - at the risk of criminal prosecution for error - only those items which will not incriminate petitioners; full compliance is required. Finally, the Government's argument would do violence to the congressional scheme. The penalties are incurred only upon failure to register as required by final orders and, under 14 (b), orders become final upon completion of judicial review. In so providing, Congress plainly manifested an intention to afford alleged members, prior to criminal prosecution for failure to register, an adjudication of all, not just some, of the claims addressed to the validity of the Board's registration orders. We therefore proceed to a determination of the merits of petitioners' self-incrimination claims.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe risks of incrimination which the petitioners take in registering are obvious. From IS-52a requires an admission of membership in the Communist Party. Such an admission of membership may be used to prosecute the registrant under the membership clause of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. 2385 (1964 ed.), or under 4 (a) of the Subversive Activities Control Act, 64 Stat. 991, 50 U.S.C. 783 (a) (1964 ed.), to mention only two federal criminal statutes. Scales v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 203, 211\n. Accordingly, we have held that mere association with the Communist Party presents sufficient threat of prosecution to support a claim of privilege. Patricia Blau v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 159\n; Irving Blau v. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 78]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n340 \nU.S. 332\n; Brunner v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 918\n; Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n. These cases involved questions to witnesses on the witness stand, but if the admission cannot be compelled in oral testimony, we do not see how compulsion in writing makes a difference for constitutional purposes. Cf. New York ex rel. Ferguson v. Reardon, 197 N. Y. 236, 243-244, 90 N. E. 829, 832. It follows that the requirement to accomplish registration by completing and filing Form IS-52a is inconsistent with the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause.\n\nThe statutory scheme, in providing that registration \"shall be accompanied\" by a registration statement, clearly implies that there is a duty to file Form IS-52, the registration statement, only if there is an enforceable obligation to accomplish registration by completing and filing Form IS-52a. Yet, even if the statute and regulations required petitioners to complete and file Form IS-52 without regard to the validity of the order to register on Form IS-52a, the requirement to complete and file Form IS-52 would also invade the privilege. Like the admission of Party membership demanded by Form IS-52a, the information called for by Form IS-52 - the organization of which the registrant is a member, his aliases, place and date of birth, a list of offices held in the organization and duties thereof - might be used as evidence in or at least supply investigatory leads to a criminal prosecution. The Government, relying on United States v. Sullivan, \n274 \nU.S. 259\n, argues that petitioners might answer some questions and appropriately claim the privilege on the form as to others, but cannot fail to submit a registration statement altogether. Apart from our conclusion that nothing in the Act or regulations permits less than literal and full compliance with the requirements of the form, the reliance on Sullivan \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 79]\n\u00a0\n is misplaced. Sullivan upheld a conviction for failure to file an income tax return on the theory that \"[i]f the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was privileged from making he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all.\" \n274 \nU.S., at 263\n. That declaration was based on the view, first, that a self-incrimination claim against every question on the tax return, or based on the mere submission of the return, would be virtually frivolous, and second, that to honor the claim of privilege not asserted at the time the return was due would make the taxpayer rather than a tribunal the final arbiter of the merits of the claim. But neither reason applies here. A tribunal, the Board, had an opportunity to pass upon the petitioners' self-incrimination claims; and since, unlike a tax return, the pervasive effect of the information called for by Form IS-52 is incriminatory, their claims are substantial and far from frivolous. In Sullivan the questions in the income tax return were neutral on their face and directed at the public at large, but here they are directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities. Petitioners' claims are not asserted in an essentially noncriminal and regulatory area of inquiry, but against an inquiry in an area permeated with criminal statutes, where response to any of the form's questions in context might involve the petitioners in the admission of a crucial element of a crime.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nSection 4 (f) of the Act,\n10\n the purported immunity provision, does not save the registration orders from petitioners' \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 80]\n\u00a0\n Fifth Amendment challenge. In Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n, decided in 1892, the Court held \"that no [immunity] statute which leaves the party or witness subject to prosecution after he answers the criminating question put to him, can have the effect of supplanting the privilege . . .,\" and that such a statute is valid only if it supplies \"a complete protection from all the perils against which the constitutional prohibition was designed to guard . . .\" by affording \"absolute immunity against future prosecution for the offence to which the question relates.\" Id., at 585-586. Measured by these standards, the immunity granted by 4 (f) is not complete. See Scales v. United States, \n367 \nU.S., at 206\n-219. It does not preclude any use of the information called for by Form IS-52, either as evidence or as an investigatory lead. With regard to the act of registering on Form IS-52a, 4 (f) provides only that the admission of Party membership thus required shall not per se constitute a violation of 4 (a) and (c) or any other criminal statute, or \"be received in evidence\" against a registrant in any criminal prosecution; it does not preclude the use of the admission as an investigatory lead, a use which is barred by the privilege. Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S., at 564\n-565, 585.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 81]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government does not contend that the shortcoming of 4 (f) is remedied in regard to information called for on the registration statement, Form IS-52. With respect to Form IS-52a, however, the argument is made that, since an order to register is preceded by a Board finding of Party membership, the admission of membership required on that form would be of no investigatory value and thus is not \"incriminatory\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment privilege. On this view the incompleteness of the 4 (f) grant of immunity would be rendered immaterial and the admission of Party membership could be compelled without violating the privilege. We disagree. The judgment as to whether a disclosure would be \"incriminatory\" has never been made dependent on an assessment of the information possessed by the Government at the time of interrogation; the protection of the privilege would be seriously impaired if the right to invoke it was dependent on such an assessment, with all its uncertainties. The threat to the privilege is no less present where it is proposed that this assessment be made in order to remedy a shortcoming in a statutory grant of immunity. The representation that the information demanded is of no utility is belied by the fact that the failure to make the disclosure is so severely sanctioned; and permitting the incompleteness of 4 (f) to be cured by such a representation would render illusory the Counselman requirement that a statute, in order to supplant the privilege, must provide \"complete protection from all the perils against which the constitutional prohibition was designed to guard.\"\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the Board's orders are set aside.\n\n     It is so ordered. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the reversal for all the reasons set out in the Court's opinion as well as those set out in his dissent in Communist Party of the United States v.

There is no occasion to decide the question since, in any event, we must reach the merits of the issues in respect of an identical order issued against petitioner Proctor.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Petitioners' other challenges assailed the Act and registration orders as denying substantive due process (because they allegedly serve no governmental purpose), as abridging First Amendment freedoms, as violating procedural due process and constituting bills of attainder (because they made the Board's 1953 determination that the Communist Party was a Communist-action organization conclusive upon petitioners), and finally, as denying petitioners the safeguards of grand jury indictment, judicial trial and trial by jury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The regulations governing Party registration pursuant to 7 (d), 50 U.S.C. 786 (d), are 28 CFR 11.200 and 11.201, and the forms are IS-51a and IS-51. The regulation governing officers obliged by 7 (h), 50 U.S.C. 786 (h) \"to register for\" the Party if it failed to register is 28 CFR 11.205. See Communist Party, \n367 \nU.S., at 105\n-110.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Copies of Form IS-52a and Form IS-52 are reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The case was argued orally by both sides on the premise that the penalty for failure to complete and file Form IS-52 constituted a separate offense punishable by fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to five years, or both, but that each day of failure to file the form did not constitute a separate offense. We have no occasion, however, to decide the question, and intimate no view upon it. See 15 (b), 50 U.S.C. 794 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Section 4 (f), 64 Stat. 992, 50 U.S.C. 783 (f) provides:\n\n\"Neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 80]\n\u00a0\n subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this section or of any other criminal statute. The fact of the registration of any person under section 787 or section 788 of this title as an officer or member of any Communist organization shall not be received in evidence against such person in any prosecution for any alleged violation of subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this section or for any alleged violation of any other criminal statute.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The legislative history includes several expressions of doubt that the immunity granted was coextensive with the privilege.

United States, \n367 \nU.S., at 212\n-219 (Court opinion), 282-287 (dissenting opinion).\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.\n\nI join in the opinion of the Court. The conclusion it reaches today was forecast in 1948. In response to the request of the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for an expression of the views of the Department of Justice on H. R. 5852, a precursor of the Act here under attack, it was then pointed out that the \"measure might be held . . . even to compel self-incrimination.\"Fn\n\nThis view was expressed in a letter over my signature as Attorney General which noted that the proposed legislation \"would require every Communist political organization and every Communist-front organization to register . . . . In addition to information which would be required of both organizations in common, a Communist political organization would be obliged to disclose \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 86]\n\u00a0\n the names and addresses of its members in its registration statement. . . . In case of the failure of any organization to register in accordance with the measure, it would be the duty of the executive officer and the secretary of such organization to register in behalf of the organization. . . . A failure to register . . . subjects the organization and certain of its agents to severe penalties.\" After consideration of other provisions of the bill the letter advised that the Department of Justice had concluded that \"the measure might be held (notwithstanding the legislative finding of clear and present danger) to deny freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly, and even to compel self-incrimination.\" It also expressed the belief of the Department that \"there would not be any voluntary registrations under the measure. Should a Communist organization fail to register, the burden to proceed would shift to the Attorney General . . . to prove that the organization is required to register.\"\n\nAs finally passed, the Act imposed a duty to register upon individual members after the refusal of the Communist Party to register and disclose its membership. Though not in H. R. 5852 about which the Department of Justice expressed constitutional doubts, this more pervasive registration requirement directly abridges the privilege of members against self-incrimination. I therefore join in this reversal.\n\n Fn \n\n[382 \nU.S. 70, 85]\n\u00a0\n Hearings on H.

Karpatkin filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring that the petitioner register as a \"Communist-front\" organization under 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended, 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S.C. 786 (1958 ed.). 117 U.S. App. D.C. 393, 331 F.2d 53. We granted certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 915\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 504]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the statute, a determination that an organization is a Communist front must rest on findings that it \"(A) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by a Communist-action organization, and (B) is primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist-action organization . . . .\" 3 (4), 64 Stat. 989, 50 U.S.C. 782 (4) (1958 ed.). In Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n, this Court sustained the Board's determination that the Communist Party is a \"Communist-action organization\" within the meaning of 3 (3) of the Act; in doing so, the Court upheld the registration requirement against First Amendment attack and found an objection based on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination not ripe for decision.\n\nIn the present case the Board's findings that petitioner is a \"communist front\" were based primarily upon evidence taken at a hearing which was concluded in 1955. The findings which support the conclusion that the petitioner is controlled by and primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to the Communist Party rest in substantial measure upon evidence of the activities of Abner Green, found to be a Party member expressly assigned in 1941 to be petitioner's executive secretary. Green died in 1959. The Board's order was filed on June 27, 1960, but the record discloses no findings or evidence concerning petitioner's activities after Green's death.\n1\n In the circumstances we think that the record \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 505]\n\u00a0\n should be brought up to date to take account of supervening events. Since a registration order operates prospectively, it is apparent that reasonably current aid and control must be established to justify a registration order. Our Communist Party decision on the Communist-action provisions did not necessarily foreclose petitioner's constitutional questions bearing on the Communist-front provisions.\n2\n Since petitioner's current status is not clear on this record, decision of the serious constitutional questions raised by the order is neither necessary nor appropriate. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cause remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner raised the point when, on February 11, 1960, the Board heard oral argument on the sufficiency of the evidence. At that time, petitioner's counsel urged as an independent reason for \"throwing out this case\" that \"[t]his case is stale and you ought to throw it out because you can't enter an order under the Act. . . . [The Attorney General] talks about what a devil Abner Green was, or Harriet Barron, the two people he said ran the organization. Well, the fact is that it has been years since Harriet Barron has had any connection with the [petitioner], and Abner Green to my great sorrow \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 505]\n\u00a0\n is now dead. Things have changed, and times have changed . . . you can't conscientiously enter an order in the present in view of the terrific amount of time that has passed and the changes in time. . . .\" XVIII Transcript 7492-7493. The Board made no mention of this argument in its report.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the issues are not plainly foreclosed is illustrated by President Truman's veto message: \"Insofar as the bill would require registration by the Communist Party itself, it does not endanger our traditional liberties. However, the application of the registration requirements to so-called Communist-front organizations can be the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press and assembly, since the alien and sedition laws of 1798. This danger arises out of the criteria or standards to be applied in determining whether an organization is a Communist-front organization. \"[T]he bill would permit such a determination to be based solely upon `the extent to which the positions taken or advanced by it from time to time on matters of policy do not deviate from those' of the Communist movement. \"This provision could easily be used to classify as a Communist-front organization any organization which is advocating a single policy or objective which is also being urged by the Communist Party or by a Communist foreign government. . . . Thus, an organization which advocates low-cost housing for sincere humanitarian reasons might be classified as a Communist-front organization because the Communists regularly exploit slum conditions as one of their fifth-column techniques.\" H. R. Doc. No. 708, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6. See also Note, 74 Yale L. J. 738 (1965).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concur, dissenting.\n\nI dissent from the refusal of the Court to face up to the important constitutional questions squarely presented by this case. The Court's excuse is that Abner Green, the executive secretary, who was prominent in petitioner's affairs, died after the close of the hearings.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner has never, so far as appears, alleged any facts indicating that with the death of Abner Green the nature of the Committee underwent any significant change. Yet this suggestion could have been made to the Board prior to its decision; and it could have been made to the Court of Appeals, for the Act in 14 (a) specifically provides: \"If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board and to be adduced upon the proceeding in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn determining that petitioner was a Communist-front organization, the Board was directed by the Act to consider other evidence in addition to evidence that petitioner's executive secretary was a member of the Communist Party. Section 13 (f) sets forth four different categories of evidence which must be considered by the Board in deciding whether an organization is a front: (1) the extent to which those who are active in the direction of the alleged front are also active in a Communist-action \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n organization; (2) the extent to which financial or other support is derived from a Communist-action organization; (3) the extent to which the alleged front's funds and personnel are used to promote the objectives of a Communist-action organization; and (4) the extent to which the alleged front's positions on matters of policy do not deviate from the Communist line. Evidence in all four of these categories was adduced.\n\nThe Court takes a peculiar view of the evidence when it surmises that the death of petitioner's executive secretary may suddenly have changed the nature of the organization. It forgets what the Court said in the Communist Party case: \"Where the current character of an organization and the nature of its connections with others is at issue, of course past conduct is pertinent. Institutions, like other organisms, are predominantly what their past has made them. History provides the illuminating context within which the implications of present conduct may be known.\" \n367 \nU.S. 1, 69\n.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Board found that the petitioner had existed in the United States since 1932 or 1933 and that it was eight or nine years later that Green became its executive secretary. The evidence before the Board established that Green was the \"top functionary\" of petitioner's national organization \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n and that he was the \"most influential official\" therein, but he was not the only top official who was found to be a member of the Communist Party. The number two person in the national organization was Harriet Barron, the administrative secretary, who with Green carried on the organization's day-to-day activities. She was found to have been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hearings and for a number of years prior thereto.\n\nA great deal of the evidence heard by the Board related to the local branches of the petitioner. The Board found: \"The management, direction, and supervision of the branches (local committees) have been by Communist Party members such as Ruth Hillsgrove for the New England Committee; Evelyn Abelson and Bess Steinberg for the Western Pennsylvania Committee; Saul Grossman for the Michigan Committee; Marion Kinney for the Northwest Committee; and Delphine Smith for the Los Angeles Committee.\" This evidence establishes that the petitioner cannot possibly be regarded as a one-man organization. It is true that Green was the leader of the national organization in New York and that he appeared at some meetings of the local committees. But the nature and existence of these local committees, which the Board regarded as \"part of\" the national organization, indicate clearly that the organization had an existence above and beyond Green himself.\n\nIn this regard the genesis of the Northwest Committee is instructive. The Board found that the organization of this branch resulted from discussions in Communist Party meetings in Seattle about the need for a local branch of the American Committee to defend Party members. This was in 1949 when the Party designated member Kinney to head this organization. Green was not present at the meetings which led to the formation of this \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n branch, and seems to have had little, if any, part in it. The first mention of Green in connection with this branch seems to be the testimony that in 1952 he made a speech at a meeting that was in some way connected with the activities of the local committee.\n\nThe ultimate finding of the Board as to these local organizations was: \"We find on the entire record that the American Committee and the various area or local committees are associated together for joint action on particular subjects. Together they constitute a voluntary association and one organization within the meaning of the term `organization' set forth in section 3 (2) of the statute.\" (Emphasis supplied.) One simply cannot read the record and come to the conclusion that this congeries of individual organizations, loosely united under the aegis of the national committee, was merely Green's alter ego and would therefore change upon his death.\n\nA Communist-front organization is one which is controlled by a Communist-action organization and which is primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to Communism. To prove this latter part of the definition the Attorney General introduced before the Board evidence showing that the Committee engaged in the legal defense of party members who were defendants in deportation and denaturalization proceedings. Much of this evidence appears to have concerned the activities of the local committees. The Board found, for example, that \"the cases of Joe Weber, Refugio Ramon Martinez, and James MacKay [were] handled by the Midwest Committee; the Mexican deportees and a group referred to as the Terminal Island Four [were] handled by the Los Angeles Committee; and the Giacomo Quattrone-Ponzi case [was] handled by the New England Committee.\" There is no reason to believe that this work of the local committees has been discontinued because of Green's death. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe case is very much alive; and the record is by no means stale. We should face up to the serious issues presented and in no way affected by Abner Green's death.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Attorney General began the present proceeding in 1953 for an order requiring the petitioner to register as a Communist-front organization, alleging that the petitioner was controlled by the Communist Party. (Immediately prior to the commencement of this proceeding the Board had issued its report of April 20, 1953, finding the Party to be a Communist-action organization.) Hearings were had before an examiner and concluded sometime in 1956. The examiner's recommended decision was issued on September 10, 1957. While the Board had the case under advisement, the second remand in the Communist Party litigation occurred. (The history of this litigation is set out in full in Communist Party v. Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n, at 19-22.) It was therefore necessary to postpone action in the present case because petitioner here was alleged to be a front for the Communist Party, and the provisions of the Act would not come into play as to petitioner unless the Party were proved to be a Communist-action organization - which was of course the purpose of the Communist Party litigation. In 1959, after the Board's second modified report in the Communist Party proceeding, the Board reactivated this case and ordered the Attorney General to make available to petitioner certain documents which intervening judicial decisions had suggested were producible. Further proceedings were had in this connection; further oral argument was presented to the Board; and the Board's report and order were filed on June 27, 1960. On appeal the Court of Appeals on January 8, 1962, remanded the case to the Board to allow petitioner to introduce evidence of alleged \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n perjured testimony. On March 8, 1962, the Board reaffirmed its earlier order. On December 17, 1963, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's order. We granted certiorari on April 27, 1964.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On oral argument before the Board on February 11, 1960, counsel for the petitioner did argue in a general way that the case was \"stale\" simply as the result of the \"passage of time.\" In the course of this argument counsel observed that \"Abner Green to my great sorrow is now dead. Things have changed, and times have changed. Standards have changed, and everybody has changed, I think, but the Department of Justice . . . .\" This passing reference to Green's death falls far short of a serious effort to show that petitioner was a legally different entity after Green's death: for example, petitioner made no effort to reopen the record for evidence concerning Green's successor, any new policies now in effect, or the like. And, as noted, no effort was made in the Court of Appeals to have the case remanded for the taking of new evidence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In that case the Court of Appeals observed: \"[I]t is rarely, if ever, possible to prove present nature by some instantaneous, contemporaneous fact, totally ignoring the whole of the past. Not only is the past clearly pertinent, it may be quite material to a determination of present nature. Whether it is material depends upon whether there is affirmative evidence of a departure from the established past. In the ordinary affairs of life and in ordinary litigation, if a person or an organization is shown to have had over many years a certain policy and program, and no more is shown, the conclusion is clearly indicated that he or it has the same policy and program in the present.\" 96 U.S. App. D.C. 66, 105, 223 F.2d 531, 570.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.Fn\n\nWhile I have joined the dissents of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS from the Court's action in remanding these cases without deciding the important constitutional questions involved, I have additional reasons for objecting to the remands. In Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1, 137\n (dissenting opinion), I stated at some length my reasons for believing that the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 781-826 (1958 ed.), on which the Government's case here rests, violates a number of provisions of our Constitution and Bill of Rights in many respects. See also Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500, 517\n (concurring opinion). I think that among other things the Act is a bill of attainder; that it imposes cruel, unusual and savage punishments for thought, speech, writing, petition and assembly; and that it stigmatizes people for their beliefs, associations and views about politics, law, and government. The Act has borrowed the worst features of old laws intended to put shackles on the minds and bodies of men, to make them confess to crime, to make them miserable while in this country, and to make it a crime even to attempt to get out of it.\n*\n It is difficult to find laws more thought-stifling \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 512]\n\u00a0\n than this one even in countries considered the most benighted. Previous efforts to have this Court pass on the constitutionality of the various provisions of this freedom-crushing law have met with frustration on one excuse or another. I protest against following this course again. My vote is to hear the case now and hold the law to be what I think it is - a wholesale denial of what I believe to be the constitutional heritage of every freedom-loving American.\n\n Fn \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n This opinion applies also to No. 65, Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade v. Subversive Activities Control Board, post, p. 513.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] In Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n, this Court held unconstitutional on its face the whole of 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended, 64 Stat. 993, 50 U.S.C. 785 (1958 ed.), which made it unlawful for any member of an organization registered under the Act \"to make application for a passport . . . or . . . to use or attempt to use any such passport.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 503, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN OIL CO. v. NEILL(1965)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: April 26, 1965\n\n\n\n\n From its Seattle Regional Office the Government Services Administration (GSA) invited bids to supply motor fuel for use by government agencies in Idaho and other States. Utah Oil Refining Company (Utah Oil) made bids from its Salt Lake City offices including two bids for supplying gasoline to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), each bid being made alternatively for delivery f. o. b. Salt Lake City or the AEC site in Idaho. GSA, at Seattle, awarded Utah Oil the contract for delivery of the gasoline at Utah Oil's Salt Lake City bulk plant, where title passed. AEC arranged for transportation of the gasoline to its Idaho site by common carriers. Utah Oil was licensed as a \"dealer\" in Idaho but its activities there were unrelated to the GSA contract. Appellee Idaho State Tax Collector imposed an excise tax on the transaction under a statute taxing the \"dealer\" who first \"receives\" motor fuel in the State, the statute making a licensed dealer the constructive recipient of motor fuel unloaded in Idaho which it sold out-of-state for in-state use to a purchaser without a license. The tax was paid under protest by Utah Oil which appellant, its successor in interest, now seeks to have refunded. The trial court granted appellant summary judgment, holding the tax invalid since applied to a sale outside Idaho. The Idaho Supreme Court reversed. Held:\n\n 1. The operating incidence of the tax fell on the dealer, who was not required to pass it on to or collect it from the consumer. Pp. 455-457.\n\n\n 2. A State's imposition of an excise tax with respect to an out-of-state transaction upon a dealer entirely dissociated from any in-state activities violates the Due Process Clause. Pp. 457-459.\n\n\n (a) The vendor's knowledge that the commodity sold was for use in the State would not of itself make the tax on the out-of-state sale permissible. P. 457.\n\n\n (b) Since every phase of the transaction here occurred outside the taxing State, neither the fact that the dealer was licensed in the State nor that it performed activities in the State suffices to uphold the tax. Pp. 458-459.\n\n\n 86 Idaho 7, 383 P.2d 350, reversed and remanded. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrank I. Goodman argued the cause for appellant and for the United States, as amicus curiae. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, I. Henry Kutz and Robert A. Bernstein for the United States, and Calvin Dworshak for appellant.\n\nAllan G. Shepard, Attorney General of Idaho, argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were William M. Smith, Assistant Attorney General, Faber F. Tway and Anton Hohler.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis appeal presents the issue of whether, where a licensed Idaho dealer in motor fuels sells and transfers gasoline outside the State for importation into the State by an agency of the Federal Government, the State of Idaho may constitutionally impose an excise tax upon the transaction on the theory that the dealer constructively \"receives\" the gasoline in Idaho upon its importation.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, invitations for bids were issued by the United States Government from the Regional Office of the General Services Administration (GSA) at Seattle, Washington, covering some 607 separate items - each designed to supply a distinct motor fuel need of a particular government agency at one of a multitude of locations in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington for the period from November 1, 1959, through October 31, 1960. Bids on each item were to be submitted to the Seattle office and were to be evaluated on their individual merits and accepted or rejected without reference to other items.\n\nAppellant's predecessor in interest, Utah Oil Refining Company (Utah Oil), is a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the GSA invitation it transmitted bids from its offices in Salt Lake City, Utah, on various items. Included were numbers 63 and 64 dealing with the supply of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n approximately 200,000 and 1,000,000 gallons of gasoline, respectively, for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) at Idaho Falls, Idaho. Bids on these two items were submitted in alternative form, quoting a price f. o. b. Salt Lake City and a price f. o. b. the AEC activity site in Idaho.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nOn October 26, 1959, Utah Oil's bids on the two items were accepted in Seattle by the GSA. Under the terms of the contract gasoline was to be sold to the AEC at a designated price f. o. b. Bulk Plant, Salt Lake City. The total price did not include any state tax but provision was made for an increase in the contract price if any such tax was imposed.\n\nIn accordance with the contract, the AEC, or its operating agent, Phillips Petroleum Company, periodically ordered some 1,436,355 gallons of gasoline. Delivery was effected by Utah Oil in Salt Lake City. Although the facts subsequent to delivery are in dispute, it appears that thereafter common carriers, selected and paid by the AEC, transported the fuel from Salt Lake City to Idaho Falls where it was placed in AEC-owned storage tanks and used in AEC operations in Idaho.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the time that Utah Oil was performing the contract, it was authorized to do business in the State of Idaho as a \"licensed dealer\" as defined by the Idaho Motor Fuels Tax Act, as amended, Idaho Code, Tit. 49, c. 12 (1957). This Act imposes an initial requirement that all motor fuel \"dealers\" hold a permit issued by the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n State Tax Collector. To procure such a permit one need only fill out an application, post bond, and pay a five-dollar filing fee. Securance of a permit is necessary before any dealer can \"import, receive, use, sell or distribute any motor fuels\" within the State. Idaho Code Ann. 49-1202 (1957).\n\nA \"dealer\" is defined by 49-1201 as any person who first receives motor fuels in the State within the meaning of the word \"received\"\n3\n As a dealer, one is required to make monthly reports to the State Tax Collector and pay an excise tax of six cents per gallon on all motor fuels \"received\" within the ambit of 49-1201 (g). The Act then provides that the proceeds of the tax are to be placed into a state highway fund.\n\nDuring its performance of the contracts Utah Oil submitted the required monthly reports. The State Tax Collector thereupon insisted that payment of the six-cent tax be forthcoming pursuant to 49-1201 (g) due to the fact \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n that Utah Oil was a licensed dealer in the State of Idaho which had sold motor fuel to an agency \"not the holder of [a] . . . dealer permit . . . for importation into the state . . . from a point of origin outside the state.\" Taxes totaling $86,181.30 were paid under protest. The instant litigation was then initiated in the District Court of the Third Judicial District of the State of Idaho for refund. Appellant claimed at the threshold that the imposition of the tax on an out-of-state sale to the Federal Government violated the Due Process, Commerce, and Supremacy Clauses of the Constitution.\n\nThe trial judge granted summary judgment for the appellant finding that the imposition of the tax violated the Due Process and Commerce Clauses since it was applied to a sale made outside of Idaho. On appeal the Idaho Supreme Court reversed, finding the constitutional objections to be without merit. 86 Idaho 7, 383 P.2d 350. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n377 \nU.S. 962\n, because the validity of a state statute had been upheld over an objection that it was repugnant to the Constitution. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2) (1958 ed.).\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWhen passing on the constitutionality of a state taxing scheme it is firmly established that this Court concerns itself with the practical operation of the tax, that is, substance rather than form. Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435, 443\n-444; Lawrence v. State Tax Comm'n, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, and cases cited therein. This approach requires us to determine the ultimate effect of the law as applied and enforced by a State or, in other words, to find the operating incidence of the tax. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77, 80\n.\n\nWhen a state court has made its own definitive determination as to the operating incidence, our task is simplified. We give this finding great weight in determining the natural \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n effect of a statute, and if it is consistent with the statute's reasonable interpretation it will be deemed conclusive.\n4\n Such a situation is manifest in the instant case.\n\nThe trial judge found that the operating incidence of the tax clearly fell on the dealer:\n\n\"[T]he dealer is not in any way required to pass the tax on or collect it from the consumer, and the ultimate purchaser or consumer has no responsibility whatsoever for payment of the tax. While it may be the overall policy of the state to collect a tax of 6  per gallon on all gasoline used to propel motor vehicles over Idaho state highways, the taxable event or transaction is not the use by the local consumer or purchaser, but the `receipt' of the gas by the dealer. It cannot be said under this statute that the licensed dealer is the mere collector of a tax from the purchaser or user . . . .\"\n\n\n This conclusion was further buttressed by finding that the Idaho administrative interpretation of the statute in the past has been to treat it as a privilege tax upon the dealer.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nOn appeal the Idaho Supreme Court left the trial court's conclusions undisturbed. Moreover, the State Attorney General in his brief before this Court expressly states that the tax \"is a privilege tax, the incidence of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n which falls on the dealer . . . .\"\n6\n This unanimity between the courts of Idaho and its agencies is to us in accord with the literal interpretation of the Act inasmuch as 49-1210 clearly states that \"each dealer shall pay to the commissioner an excise tax of six cents per gallon on all motor fuels . . .\" with no coinciding provision passing the burden of the tax to the purchaser. We therefore give the findings below controlling effect and hold that the incidence of the tax falls on the dealer.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Idaho Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge that the taxed events were the sales of gasoline in Utah, two factors were considered sufficient to bring the transactions within the purview of Idaho's taxing power. First, Utah Oil sold the gasoline with knowledge that it would be imported into and used within Idaho; and, second, Utah Oil had been authorized to do business in Idaho having applied for and received a dealer's permit \"authorizing it to enter into the Idaho market as a distributor of motor fuels . . . .\" 86 Idaho, at 23, 383 P.2d, at 360. We conclude that these considerations are insufficient to uphold the tax as against attack under the Due Process Clause.\n\nThe mere fact that Utah Oil knew that the gasoline was to be imported into Idaho merits little discussion. More than once this Court has struck down taxes directly imposed on or resulting from out-of-state sales which were held to be insufficiently related to activities within the taxing State, despite the fact that the vendor knew that the goods were destined for use in that State. Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 340\n (use tax); Norton Co. v. Department of Revenue, \n340 \nU.S. 534\n (gross receipts \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n tax); McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., \n322 \nU.S. 327\n (sales tax).\n\nThese cases have also firmly established the doctrine that when a tax is imposed on an out-of-state vendor, \"nexus\" between the taxing State and the taxpayer is the outstanding prerequisite on state power to tax. Consistent with this requirement there must be \"some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.\" Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland, supra, at 344-345. Granted that when a corporation, pursuant to permission given, enters a State and proceeds to do local business the \"link\" is strong. In such instances there is a strong inference that it exists between the State and transactions which result in economic benefits obtained from a source within the State's territorial limits. The corporation can, however, exempt itself by a clear showing that there are no in-state activities connected with out-of-state sales. In such instances, the transactions are said to be \"dissociated from the local business,\" Norton Co. v. Department of Revenue, supra, at 537, and therefore may not, consistent with due process, be taxed.\n\nIn the present case it is plain that neither Utah Oil's position as a licensed dealer in Idaho nor the fact that it otherwise engaged in business there will suffice to uphold the tax. Utah Oil's transfer of gasoline was unquestionably an out-of-state sale vis-a-vis Idaho and entirely unconnected with its business in that State. Each and every phase of the transaction had its locus outside of Idaho: invitations for bids were issued by the Government in Seattle, Washington; Utah Oil submitted its bids from Salt Lake City; the bids were accepted in Seattle; the contract called for delivery of the gasoline f. o. b. Salt Lake City; Utah Oil delivered the gasoline to Salt Lake City, and it was there that title passed. There is no reason to suppose, nor does the record in any way \n\n[380 \nU.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n indicate, that Utah Oil's activities in Idaho contributed in any way to the procurement or performance of the contract. Compare Norton Co. v. Department of Revenue, supra, with General Motors Corp. v. Washington, \n377 \nU.S. 436\n.\n\nThe Idaho Supreme Court was fully cognizant of these facts but chose to characterize Utah Oil's dealer's permit as authorizing it \"to engage in the very activity it now claims is exempt from the tax.\" 86 Idaho, at 23, 383 P.2d ___, at 360. This statement, however, fails to reflect the clear holding by this Court that the granting by a State \"of the privilege of doing business there and its consequent authority to tax the privilege do not withdraw from the protection of the due process clause the privilege\" of doing business elsewhere. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, supra, at 82. This is exactly the situation present in the instant case. Under the circumstances we hold the fact that Utah Oil was the holder of an Idaho dealer's permit to be purely fortuitous.\n\nSince we decide that the exacted tax violates the Due Process Clause, there is no need for discussion of constitutionality under the Commerce or Supremacy Clause. The decision of the Idaho Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although the invitation for bids issued by the GSA proposed the alternative delivery points it was discretionary with each bidder as to whether or not quotations for each point were submitted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On the ground that the tax was not a \"use tax\" in the usual sense, the trial judge declined the offer of proof as to what occurred after delivery which was tendered by the State Tax Collector.

The National Labor Relations Board found that the employer could not have reasonably anticipated a strike, that the sole purpose of the layoffs was to bring economic pressure to secure a prompt and favorable settlement of the labor dispute, and that therefore petitioner violated 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Court of Appeals granted enforcement of the Board's order. Held: An employer does not commit an unfair labor practice under either 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3) of the Act when, after an impasse has been reached in negotiations, he temporarily shuts down his plant and lays off his employees for the sole purpose of applying economic pressure in support of his legitimate bargaining position.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe American Ship Building Company seeks review of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit enforcing an order of the National Labor Relations Board which found that the company had committed an unfair labor practice under 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n1\n The question presented is that expressly reserved in Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Local Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 93\n; namely, whether an employer commits an unfair labor practice under these sections of the Act when he temporarily lays off or \"locks out\" his employees during a labor dispute to bring economic pressure in support of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 302]\n\u00a0\n his bargaining position. To resolve an asserted conflict among the circuits\n2\n upon this important question of federal labor law we granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 814\n.\n\nThe American Ship Building Company operates four shipyards on the Great Lakes - at Chicago, at Buffalo, and at Toledo and Lorain, Ohio. The company is primarily engaged in the repairing of ships, a highly seasonal business concentrated in the winter months when the freezing of the Great Lakes renders shipping impossible. What limited business is obtained during the shipping season is frequently such that speed of execution is of the utmost importance to minimize immobilization of the ships.\n\nSince 1952 the employer has engaged in collective bargaining with a group of eight unions. Prior to the negotiations here in question, the employer had contracted with the unions on five occasions, each agreement having been preceded by a strike. The particular chapter of the collective bargaining history with which we are concerned opened shortly before May 1, 1961, when the unions notified the company of their intention to seek modification of the current contract, due to expire on August 1.\n\nAt the initial bargaining meeting on June 6, 1961, the company took the position that its competitive situation would not allow increased compensation. The unions countered with demands for increased fringe benefits and some unspecified wage increase. Several meetings were held in June and early July during which negotiations focussed upon the fringe benefit questions without any substantial progress. At the last meeting, the parties resolved to call in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n Service, which set the next meeting for July 19. At this meeting, the unions first unveiled their demand for a 20-cents-an-hour wage increase and proposed a six-month extension of the contract pending continued negotiations. The employer rejected the proposed extension because it would have led to expiration during the peak season.\n\nFurther negotiations narrowed the dispute to five or six issues, all involving substantial economic differences. On July 31, the eve of the contract's expiration, the employer made a proposal; the unions countered with another, revived their proposal for a six-month extension, and proposed in the alternative that the existing contract, with its no-strike clause, be extended indefinitely with the terms of the new contract to be made retroactive to August 1.\n3\n After rejection of the proposed extensions, the employer's proposal was submitted to the unions' membership; on August 8 the unions announced that this proposal had been overwhelmingly rejected. The following day, the employer made another proposal which the unions refused to submit to their membership; the unions made no counteroffer and the parties separated without setting a date for further meetings, leaving this to the discretion of the conciliator.\n\nThus on August 9, after extended negotiations, the parties separated without having resolved substantial differences on the central issues dividing them and without having specific plans for further attempts to resolve them - a situation which the trial examiner found was an impasse. Throughout the negotiations, the employer displayed anxiety as to the unions' strike plans, fearing that the unions would call a strike as soon as a ship entered the Chicago yard or delay negotiations into the winter to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n increase strike leverage. The union negotiator consistently insisted that it was his intention to reach an agreement without calling a strike; however, he did concede incomplete control over the workers - a fact borne out by the occurrence of a wildcat strike in February 1961. Because of the danger of an unauthorized strike and the consistent and deliberate use of strikes in prior negotiations, the employer remained apprehensive of the possibility of a work stoppage.\n\nIn light of the failure to reach an agreement and the lack of available work, the employer decided to lay off certain of its workers. On August 11 the employees received a notice which read: \"Because of the labor dispute which has been unresolved since August 1, 1961, you are laid off until further notice.\" The Chicago yard was completely shut down and all but two employees laid off at the Toledo yard. A large force was retained at Lorain to complete a major piece of work there and the employees in the Buffalo yard were gradually laid off as miscellaneous tasks were completed. Negotiations were resumed shortly after these layoffs and continued for the following two months until a two-year contract was agreed upon on October 27. The employees were recalled the following day.\n\nUpon claims filed by the unions, the General Counsel of the Board issued a complaint charging the employer with violations of 8 (a) (1), (3), and (5).\n4\n The trial examiner found that although there had been no work in the Chicago yard since July 19, its closing was not due to lack of work. Despite similarly slack seasons in the past, the employer had for 17 years retained a nucleus crew to do maintenance work and remain ready to take such work as might come in. The examiner went on to find that the employer was reasonably apprehensive \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n of a strike at some point. Although the unions had given assurances that there would be no strike, past bargaining history was thought to justify continuing apprehension that the unions would fail to make good their assurances. It was further found that the employer's primary purpose in locking out its employees was to avert peculiarly harmful economic consequences which would be imposed on it and its customers if a strike were called either while a ship was in the yard during the shipping season or later when the yard was fully occupied. The examiner concluded that the employer:\n\n\"was economically justified and motivated in laying off its employees when it did, and that the fact that its judgment was partially colored by its intention to break the impasse which existed is immaterial in the peculiar and special circumstances of this case. Respondent, by its actions, therefore, did not violate Section 8 (a) (1), (3), and (5) of the Act.\"\n\n\n A three-to-two majority of the Board rejected the trial examiner's conclusion that the employer could reasonably anticipate a strike. Finding the unions' assurances sufficient to dispel any such apprehension, the Board was able to find only one purpose underlying the layoff: a desire to bring economic pressure to secure prompt settlement of the dispute on favorable terms. The Board did not question the examiner's finding that the layoffs had not occurred until after a bargaining impasse had been reached. Nor did the Board remotely suggest that the company's decision to lay off its employees was based either on union hostility or on a desire to avoid its bargaining obligations under the Act. The Board concluded that the employer \"by curtailing its operations at the South Chicago yard with the consequent layoff of the employees, coerced employees in the exercise of their bargaining rights in violation of Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n and discriminated against its employees within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act.\"\n5\n 142 N. L. R. B., at 1364-1365.\n\nThe difference between the Board and the trial examiner is thus a narrow one turning on their differing assessments of the circumstances which the employer claims gave it reason to anticipate a strike. Both the Board and the examiner assumed, within the established pattern of Board analysis.\n6\n that if the employer had shut down its yard and laid off its workers solely for the purpose of bringing to bear economic pressure to break an impasse and secure more favorable contract terms, an unfair labor practice would be made out. \"The Board has held that, absent special circumstances, an employer may not during bargaining negotiations either threaten to lock out or lock out his employees in aid of his bargaining position. Such conduct the Board has held presumptively infringes upon the collective-bargaining rights of employees in violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and the lockout, with its consequent layoff, amounts to discrimination within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (3). In addition, the Board has held that such conduct subjects the Union and the employees it represents to unwarranted and illegal pressure and creates an atmosphere in which the free opportunity for negotiation contemplated by Section 8 (a) (5) \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n does not exist.\" Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., 121 N. L. R. B. 334, 337.\n\nThe Board has, however, exempted certain classes of lockouts from proscription. \"Accordingly, it has held that lockouts are permissible to safeguard against . . . loss where there is reasonable ground for believing that a strike was threatened or imminent.\" Ibid. Developing this distinction in its rulings, the Board has approved lockouts designed to prevent seizure of a plant by a sitdown strike, Link-Belt Co., 26 N. L. R. B. 227; to forestall repetitive disruptions of an integrated operation by \"quickie\" strikes, International Shoe Co., 93 N. L. R. B. 907; to avoid spoilage of materials which would result from a sudden work stoppage, Duluth Bottling Assn., 48 N. L. R. B. 1335; and to avert the immobilization of automobiles brought in for repair, Betts Cadillac Olds, Inc., 96 N. L. R. B. 268. In another distinct class of cases the Board has sanctioned the use of the lockout by a multiemployer bargaining unit as a response to a whipsaw strike against one of its members. Buffalo Linen Supply Co., 109 N. L. R. B. 447, rev'd Sub nom. Truck Drivers Union v. Labor Board, 231 F.2d 110, rev'd, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn analyzing the status of the bargaining lockout under 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, it is important that the practice with which we are here concerned be distinguished from other forms of temporary separation from employment. No one would deny that an employer is free to shut down his enterprise temporarily \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n for reasons of renovation or lack of profitable work unrelated to his collective bargaining situation. Similarly, we put to one side cases where the Board has concluded on the basis of substantial evidence that the employer has used a lockout as a means to injure a labor organization or to evade his duty to bargain collectively. Hopwood Retinning Co., 4 N. L. R. B. 922; Scott Paper Box Co., 81 N. L. R. B. 535. What we are here concerned with is the use of a temporary layoff of employees solely as a means to bring economic pressure to bear in support of the employer's bargaining position, after an impasse has been reached. This is the only issue before us, and all that we decide.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nTo establish that this practice is a violation of 8 (a) (1), it must be shown that the employer has interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of some right protected by 7 of the Act. The Board's position is premised on the view that the lockout interferes with two of the rights guaranteed by 7: the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike. In the Board's view, the use of the lockout \"punishes\" employees for the presentation of and adherence to demands made by their bargaining representatives and so coerces them in the exercise of their right to bargain collectively. It is important to note that there is here no allegation that the employer used the lockout in the service of designs inimical to the process of collective bargaining. There was no evidence and no finding that the employer was hostile to its employees' banding together for collective bargaining or that the lockout was designed to discipline \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n them for doing so. It is therefore inaccurate to say that the employer's intention was to destroy or frustrate the process of collective bargaining. What can be said is that it intended to resist the demands made of it in the negotiations and to secure modification of these demands. We cannot see that this intention is in any way inconsistent with the employees' rights to bargain collectively.\n\nMoreover, there is no indication, either as a general matter or in this specific case, that the lockout will necessarily destroy the unions' capacity for effective and responsible representation. The unions here involved have vigorously represented the employees since 1952, and there is nothing to show that their ability to do so has been impaired by the lockout. Nor is the lockout one of those acts which are demonstrably so destructive of collective bargaining that the Board need not inquire into employer motivation, as might be the case, for example, if an employer permanently discharged his unionized staff and replaced them with employees known to be possessed of a violent antiunion animus. Cf. Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n. The lockout may well dissuade employees from adhering to the position which they initially adopted in the bargaining, but the right to bargain collectively does not entail any \"right\" to insist on one's position free from economic disadvantage. Proper analysis of the problem demands that the simple intention to support the employer's bargaining position as to compensation and the like be distinguished from a hostility to the process of collective bargaining which could suffice to render a lockout unlawful. See Labor Board v. Brown, ante, p. 278.\n\nThe Board has taken the complementary view that the lockout interferes with the right to strike protected under \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 310]\n\u00a0\n 7 and 13 of the Act\n9\n in that it allows the employer to pre-empt the possibility of a strike and thus leave the union with \"nothing to strike against.\" Insofar as this means that once employees are locked out, they are deprived of their right to call a strike against the employer because he is already shut down, the argument is wholly specious, for the work stoppage which would have been the object of the strike has in fact occurred.\n10\n It is true that recognition of the lockout deprives the union of exclusive control of the timing and duration of work stoppages calculated to influence the result of collective bargaining negotiations, but there is nothing in the statute which would imply that the right to strike \"carries with it\" the right exclusively to determine the timing and duration of all work stoppages. The right to strike as commonly understood is the right to cease work - nothing more. No doubt a union's bargaining power would be enhanced if it possessed not only the simple right to strike but also the power exclusively to determine when work stoppages should occur, but the Act's provisions are not indefinitely elastic, content-free forms to be shaped in whatever manner the Board might think best conforms to the proper balance of bargaining power.\n\nThus, we cannot see that the employer's use of a lockout solely in support of a legitimate bargaining position is in any way inconsistent with the right to bargain collectively or with the right to strike. Accordingly, we conclude \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 311]\n\u00a0\n that on the basis of the findings made by the Board in this case, there has been no violation of 8 (a) (1).\n\nSection 8 (a) (3) prohibits discrimination in regard to tenure or other conditions of employment to discourage union membership. Under the words of the statute there must be both discrimination and a resulting discouragement of union membership. It has long been established that a finding of violation under this section will normally turn on the employer's motivation. See Labor Board v. Brown, ante, p. 278; Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17, 43\n; Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 46\n. Thus when the employer discharges a union leader who has broken shop rules, the problem posed is to determine whether the employer has acted purely in disinterested defense of shop discipline or has sought to damage employee organization. It is likely that the discharge will naturally tend to discourage union membership in both cases, because of the loss of union leadership and the employees' suspicion of the employer's true intention. But we have consistently construed the section to leave unscathed a wide range of employer actions taken to serve legitimate business interests in some significant fashion, even though the act committed may tend to discourage union membership. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333, 347\n. Such a construction of 8 (a) (3) is essential if due protection is to be accorded the employer's right to manage his enterprise. See Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., ante, p. 263.\n\nThis is not to deny that there are some practices which are inherently so prejudicial to union interests and so devoid of significant economic justification that no specific evidence of intent to discourage union membership or other antiunion animus is required. In some cases, it may be that the employer's conduct carries with it an inference of unlawful intention so compelling that it is \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 312]\n\u00a0\n justifiable to disbelieve the employer's protestations of innocent purpose. Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, supra, at 44-45; Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra. Thus where many have broken a shop rule, but only union leaders have been discharged, the Board need not listen too long to the plea that shop discipline was simply being enforced. In other situations, we have described the process as the \"far more delicate task . . . of weighing the interests of employees in concerted activity against the interest of the employer in operating his business in a particular manner . . . .\" Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, at 229.\n\nBut this lockout does not fall into that category of cases arising under 8 (a) (3) in which the Board may truncate its inquiry into employer motivation. As this case well shows, use of the lockout does not carry with it any necessary implication that the employer acted to discourage union membership or otherwise discriminate against union members as such. The purpose and effect of the lockout were only to bring pressure upon the union to modify its demands. Similarly, it does not appear that the natural tendency of the lockout is severely to discourage union membership while serving no significant employer interest. In fact, it is difficult to understand what tendency to discourage union membership or otherwise discriminate against union members was perceived by the Board. There is no claim that the employer locked out only union members, or locked out any employee simply because he was a union member; not is it alleged that the employer conditioned rehiring upon resignation from the union. It is true that the employees suffered economic disadvantage because of their union's insistence on demands unacceptable to the employer, but this is also true of many steps which an employer may take during a bargaining conflict, and the existence of an arguable possibility that someone may feel himself \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 313]\n\u00a0\n discouraged in his union membership or discriminated against by reason of that membership cannot suffice to label them violations of 8 (a) (3) absent some unlawful intention. The employer's permanent replacement of strikers (Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., supra), his unilateral imposition of terms (Labor Board v. Tex-Tan, Inc., 318 F.2d 472, 479-482), or his simple refusal to make a concession which would terminate a strike - all impose economic disadvantage during a bargaining conflict, but none is necessarily a violation of 8 (a) (3).\n\nTo find a violation of 8 (a) (3), then, the Board must find that the employer acted for a proscribed purpose. Indeed, the Board itself has always recognized that certain \"operative\" or \"economic\" purposes would justify a lockout. But the Board has erred in ruling that only these purposes will remove a lockout from the ambit of 8 (a) (3), for that section requires an intention to discourage union membership or otherwise discriminate against the union. There was not the slightest evidence and there was no finding that the employer was actuated by a desire to discourage membership in the union as distinguished from a desire to affect the outcome of the particular negotiations in which it was involved. We recognize that the \"union membership\" which is not to be discouraged refers to more than the payment of dues and that measures taken to discourage participation in protected union activities may be found to come within the proscription. Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, supra, at 39-40. However, there is nothing in the Act which gives employees the right to insist on their contract demands, free from the sort of economic disadvantage which frequently attends bargaining disputes. Therefore, we conclude that where the intention proven is merely to bring about a settlement of a labor dispute on favorable terms, no violation of 8 (a) (3) is shown. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 314]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe conclusions which we draw from analysis of 8 (a) (1) and (3) are consonant with what little of relevance can be drawn from the balance of the statute and its legislative history. In the original version of the Act, the predecessor of 8 (a) (1) declared it an unfair labor practice \"[t]o attempt, by interference, influence, restraint, favor, coercion, or lockout, or by any other means, to impair the right of employees guaranteed in section 4.\"\n11\n Prominent in the criticism leveled at the bill in the Senate Committee hearings was the charge that it did not accord even-handed treatment to employers and employees because it prohibited the lockout while protecting the strike.\n12\n In the face of such criticism, the Committee added a provision prohibiting employee interference with employer bargaining activities\n13\n and deleted the reference to the lockout.\n14\n A plausible inference to be drawn from this history is that the language was deleted \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 315]\n\u00a0\n to modify those who saw in the bill an inequitable denial of resort to the lockout, and to remove any language which might give rise to fears that the lockout was being proscribed per se. It is in any event clear that the Committee was concerned with the status of the lockout and that the bill, as reported and as finally enacted, contained no prohibition on the use of the lockout as such.\n\nAlthough neither 8 (a) (1) nor 8 (a) (3) refers specifically to the lockout, various other provisions of the National Labor Relations Act do refer to the lockout, and these references can be interpreted as a recognition of the legitimacy of the device as a means of applying economic pressure in support of bargaining positions. Thus 29 U.S.C. 158 (d) (4) (1958 ed.) prohibits the use of a strike or lockout unless requisite notice procedures have been complied with; 29 U.S.C. 173 (c) (1958 ed.) directs the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to seek voluntary resolution of labor disputes without resort to strikes or lockouts; and 29 U.S.C. 176, 178 (1958 ed.), authorize procedures whereby the President can institute a board of inquiry to forestall certain strikes or lockouts. The correlative use of the terms \"strike\" and \"lockout\" in these sections contemplates that lockouts will be used in the bargaining process in some fashion. This is not to say that these provisions serve to define the permissible scope of a lockout by an employer. That, in the context of the present case, is a question ultimately to be resolved by analysis of 8 (a) (1) and (3).\n\nThe Board has justified its ruling in this case and its general approach to the legality of lockouts on the basis of its special competence to weigh the competing interests of employers and employees and to accommodate these interests according to its expert judgment. \"The Board has reasonably concluded that the availability of such a weapon would so substantially tip the scales in the employer's favor as to defeat the Congressional purpose of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 316]\n\u00a0\n placing employees on a par with their adversary at the bargaining table.\"\n15\n To buttress its decision as to the balance struck in this particular case, the Board points out that the employer has been given other weapons to counterbalance the employees' power of strike. The employer may permanently replace workers who have gone out on strike, or, by stockpiling and subcontracting, maintain his commercial operations while the strikers bear the economic brunt of the work stoppage. Similarly, the employer can institute unilaterally the working conditions which he desires once his contract with the union has expired. Given these economic weapons, it is argued, the employer has been adequately equipped with tools of economic self-help.\n\nThere is of course no question that the Board is entitled to the greatest deference in recognition of its special competence in dealing with labor problems. In many areas its evaluation of the competing interests of employer and employee should unquestionably be given conclusive effect in determining the application of 8 (a) (1), (3), and (5). However, we think that the Board construes its functions too expansively when it claims general authority to define national labor policy by balancing the competing interests of labor and management.\n\nWhile a primary purpose of the National Labor Relations Act was to redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management, it sought to accomplish that result by conferring certain affirmative rights on employees and by placing certain enumerated restrictions on the activities of employers. The Act prohibited acts which interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of their rights to organize a union, to bargain collectively, and to strike; it proscribed \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 317]\n\u00a0\n discrimination in regard to tenure and other conditions of employment to discourage membership in any labor organization. The central purpose of these provisions was to protect employee self-organization and the process of collective bargaining from disruptive interferences by employers. Having protected employee organization in countervailance to the employers' bargaining power, and having established a system of collective bargaining whereby the newly coequal adversaries might resolve their disputes, the Act also contemplated resort to economic weapons should more peaceful measures not avail. Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) do not give the Board a general authority to assess the relative economic power of the adversaries in the bargaining process and to deny weapons to one party or the other because of its assessment of that party's bargaining power. Labor Board v. Brown, ante, p. 278. In this case the Board has, in essence, denied the use of the bargaining lockout to the employer because of its conviction that use of this device would give the employer \"too much power.\" In so doing, the Board has stretched 8 (a) (1) and (3) far beyond their functions of protecting the rights of employee organization and collective bargaining. What we have recently said in a closely related context is equally applicable here:\n\n\"[W]hen the Board moves in this area . . . it is functioning as an arbiter of the sort of economic weapons the parties can use in seeking to gain acceptance of their bargaining demands. It has sought to introduce some standard of properly `balanced' bargaining power, or some new distinction of justifiable and unjustifiable, proper and `abusive' economic weapons into . . . the Act. . . . We have expressed our belief that this amounts to the Board's entrance into the substantive aspects of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 318]\n\u00a0\n bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced.\" Labor Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union, \n361 \nU.S. 477, 497\n-498.\n\n\n We are unable to find that any fair construction of the provisions relied on by the Board in this case can support its finding of an unfair labor practice. Indeed, the role assumed by the Board in this area is fundamentally inconsistent with the structure of the Act and the function of the sections relied upon. The deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress. Accordingly, we hold that an employer violates neither 8 (a) (1) nor 8 (a) (3) when, after a bargaining impasse has been reached, he temporarily shuts down his plant and lays off his employees for the sole purpose of bringing economic pressure to bear in support of his legitimate bargaining position.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 142 N.

JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the result.\n\nThe Court today holds that the use of economic weapons by an employer for the purpose of improving his bargaining position can never violate the broad provisions of 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the NLRA and hence a bargaining lockout of employees in resistance to demands of a union is invariably exempt from the proscriptions of the Act. As my Brother GOLDBERG well points out, the Court applies legal standards that cannot be reconciled with decisions of this Court defining the Board's functions in applying these sections of the Act and does so without pausing to ascertain if the Board's factual premises are supported by substantial evidence. I also think the Court, in the process of establishing the legality of a bargaining lockout, overlooks the uncontradicted facts in this \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 319]\n\u00a0\n record and the accepted findings of the trial examiner which indicate to me that the employer's closing of the Chicago yard was not a \"lockout\" for the purpose of bringing economic pressure to break an impasse and to secure more favorable contract terms.\n\nIn my view the issue posed in this case is whether an employer who in fact anticipates a strike may inform customers of this belief to protect his commercial relationship with customers and to safeguard their property, thereby discouraging business, and then lay off employees for whom there is no available work. I, like the trial examiner, think he may, and do not think this conduct can be impeached under 8 (a) (1) and (3) by merely asserting that the employer and his customers were erroneous in believing a strike was imminent.\n\nThe Board, the Court of Appeals, and presumably this Court, accept all the findings of the trial examiner, except the finding that the employer's honest belief that a strike would occur had a reasonable basis in fact. The examiner found that at the time of the layoffs at the Chicago yard there was no work there and very little at the other yards, which remained open until all available work was completed. During past slack summer seasons a nucleus crew had been retained at the yards to perform emergency repair jobs for Ship Building's 14 or 15 regular customers. Absent a job, these employees also did maintenance work, but the accommodation of these regular customers and retention of their good will was the only reason for remaining open, the operations being otherwise unprofitable. The customers learned of the labor unrest at the yards through newspaper accounts and Ship Building's plant managers, who felt constrained to tell long-standing customers of the possibility of a strike during the course of repair work. The manager of the Buffalo yard was of the opinion that \"the owner that brought the boat into the dock would have rocks in his head if he would have \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 320]\n\u00a0\n taken the chance.\" Work was not refused, however. There were few, if any, requests for repairs during that summer, a substantial number of shipowners being reluctant to bring their vessels into the yard. The last job left the Chicago yard three weeks before closing. The examiner found that at the time of closing, Ship Building had \"men working on maintenance in the yards, with no work on hand, none anticipated, and customers refusing to send work in.\" Only those workers for whom there was no work were laid off and no new jobs were taken on. The examiner noted that the employer was not unaware of the union's negotiating strategy and of the possible effect of a closing on this strategy. But in carefully assessing all the testimony he found that at most these considerations partially colored the employer's motivation. The examiner concluded from these facts that \"the economic inducements so overshadowed anything improper that they must be considered primary, particularly when the economic factors which supported them arose through no fault of Respondent and anteceded the layoff.\"\n\nGiven the finding that the closing was due to lack of work at the Chicago yard, it is no answer to say, as the Board does, that there was no reasonable basis to anticipate a strike and hence the closing was an offensive bargaining lockout. Whether there was a reasonable basis to fear a strike or not, the fact remains that the employer, and its customers, did fear a strike, and consequently there was no work for the employees. It has long been the law that an employer is free to modify or shut down operations temporarily for business reasons unrelated to the exercise by his employees of statutory rights, and the reasonableness of an employer's response to business exigencies is not ordinarily subject to review. See Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., 145 N. L. R. B. 785 (1964); Associated General Contractors of America, Inc., 105 N. L. R. B. 767 (1953); cf. Fibreboard Paper Products v. Labor Board, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 321]\n\u00a0\n \n379 \nU.S. 203\n; Textile Workers Union v. Darlington Mfg. Co., decided today, ante, p. 263. There is nothing in the decisions of the NLRB, including this case, which would indicate that there are occasions when an employer may not truthfully inform his customers of a labor dispute and his fear of a strike to protect his business and their property and may not lay off employees for lack of work. Indeed, these decisions hold that an employer may shut down in response to such economic conditions, even though these conditions are the result of protected concerted activities, Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., 145 N. L. R. B. 785 (1964); Associated General Contractors of America, Inc., 105 N. L. R. B. 767 (1953); H. H. Zimmerli, 133 N. L. R. B. 1217 (1961), so long as the creation of or alleged reliance on these conditions is not a subterfuge for a lockout, Ripley Mfg. Co., 138 N. L. R. B. 1452 (1962); Savoy Laundry, Inc., 137 N. L. R. B. 306 (1962); New England Web, Inc., 135 N. L. R. B. 1019 (1962). There is no evidence here that the lack of work was a result of the employer's decision or desire to lay off its employees and the Board did not so find. I do not now determine whether a temporary economic shutdown could ever be found to violate the Act. Here the Board has given no reasons, no rationale, to show how this closing violated the Act, except to say the closing was a bargaining lockout. A lockout is the refusal by an employer to furnish available work to his regular employees. It is apparent that the considerations which fault an employer for refusing to furnish available work are quite different from those which would prohibit him from laying off workers for whom there is no work. Hence, reliance on the Board's lockout cases does not explain, no less support, the result reached in this case. The compelling conclusion is that the Board has failed to \"disclose the basis of its order\" and to \"give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 322]\n\u00a0\n Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n. This is not to say the Board has reached an erroneous balance in regard to the bargaining lockout; it is to say that the bargaining lockout analysis will not suffice to judge the legality of the layoffs in this case.\n\nThe Court, like the Board, assimilates the employer's conduct here to the bargaining lockout and restrikes the balance; it dismisses the actual justification for the closing with the assertion that the \"examiner found . . . [the] closing was not due to lack of work. Despite similarly slack seasons in the past, the employer had for 17 years retained a nucleus crew to do maintenance work and remain ready to take such work as might come in.\" Ante, at 304. This is puzzling, since the examiner found precisely the contrary, and neither the Board nor the Court of Appeals took issue with these findings. The examiner said that a nucleus crew was maintained in the past only in the expectation of emergency work, the performance of such work being thought necessary to maintain customer good will. Because of the labor uncertainty and the decision that undertaking emergency jobs would jeopardize customer relations, there was no expectation of work during the summer of 1961, unlike past years. Since I think an employer's decision to lay off employees because of lack of work is not ordinarily barred by the Act, and since neither the Board nor the Court properly can ignore this claim, I would reverse the Board's order, but without reaching out to decide an issue not at all presented by this case.\n\nSince the Court does rule on the status of the bargaining lockout under the National Labor Relations Act. I feel constrained to state my views. This Court has long recognized that the Labor Relations Act \"did not undertake the impossible task of specifying in precise and unmistakable language each incident which would constitute an unfair labor practice,\" but \"left to the Board the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 323]\n\u00a0\n work of applying the Act's general prohibitory language in the light of the infinite combinations of events which might be charged as violative of its terms.\" Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793, 798\n. Thus the legal status of the bargaining lockout, as the Court indicated in Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 96\n, is to be determined by \"the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests.\"\n\nThe Board has balanced these interests here - the value of the lockout as an economic weapon against its impact on protected concerted activities, including the right to strike, for which the Act has special solicitude, Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221, 234\n - and has determined that the employer's interest in obtaining a bargaining victory does not outweigh the damaging consequences of the lockout. It determined that for an employer to deprive employees of their livelihood because of demands made by their representatives and in order to compel submission to the employer's demands, coerces employees in their exercise of the right to bargain collectively and discourages resort to that right. And this interferes with the right to strike, sharply reducing the effectiveness of that weapon and denying the union control over the timing of the economic contest. The Court rejects this reasoning on the ground that the lockout is not conduct \"demonstrably so destructive of collective bargaining that the Board need not inquire into employer motivation.\" Ante, at 309. Since the employer's true motive is to bring about settlement of the dispute on favorable terms, there can be no substantial discouragement of union membership or interference with concerted activities. And the right to strike is only the right to cease work, which the lockout only encourages rather than displaces.\n\nThis tour de force denies the Board's assessment of the impact on employee rights and this truncated definition \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 324]\n\u00a0\n of the right to strike, nowhere supported in the Act, is unprecedented. Until today the employer's true motive or sole purpose has not always been determinative of the impact on employee rights. Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n; Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17\n; Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n; Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n; Labor Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., \n379 \nU.S. 21\n. The importance of the employer's right to hire replacements to continue operations, or of his right to fire employees he has good reason to believe are guilty of gross misconduct was not doubted in Erie Resistor and Burnup & Sims. Nonetheless the Board was upheld in its determination that the award of super-seniority to strike replacements and discharge of the suspected employee were unfair labor practices. Of course, such conduct is taken in the pursuit of legitimate business ends, but nonetheless the \"conduct does speak for itself . . . it carries with it unavoidable consequences which the employer not only foresaw but which he must have intended.\" Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S., at 228\n. I would have thought it apparent that loss of jobs for an indefinite period, and the threatened loss of jobs, which the Court's decision assuredly sanctions, cf. Textile Workers Union v. Darlington Mfg. Co., decided today, ante, at 274, n. 20, because of the union's negotiating activity, itself protected conduct under 7, hardly encourage affiliation with a union.\n\nIf the Court means what it says today, an employer may not only lock out after impasse consistent with 8 (a) (1) and (3), but replace his locked-out employees with temporary help, cf. Labor Board v. Brown, ante, p. 278, or perhaps permanent replacements, and also lock out long before an impasse is reached. Maintaining operations during a labor dispute is at least equally as important an interest as achieving a bargaining victory, see \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 325]\n\u00a0\n Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, and a shutdown during or before negotiations advances an employer's bargaining position as much as a lockout after impasse. And the hiring of replacements is wholly consistent with the employer's intent \"to resist the demands made of it in the negotiations and to secure modification of these demands.\" Ante, at 309. I would also assume that under 8 (a) (1) and (3) he may lock out for the sole purpose of resisting the union's assertion of grievances under a collective bargaining contract, absent a no-lockout clause. Given these legitimate business purposes, there is no antiunion motivation, and absent such motivation, a lockout cannot be deemed destructive of employee rights. \"[I]nquiry into employer motivation\" may not be truncated. Ante, at 312. \"Proper analysis of the problem demands that the simple intention to support the employer's bargaining position as to compensation and the like be distinguished from a hostility to the process of collective bargaining which could suffice to render a lockout unlawful.\" Ante, at 309. I think that the Board may assess the impact of a bargaining lockout on protected employee rights, without regard to motivation, and that the Court errs in failing to give due consideration to the Board's conclusions in this regard.\n\nThe balance and accommodation of \"conflicting legitimate interests\" in labor relations does not admit of a simple solution and a myopic focus on the true intent or motive of the employer has not been the determinative standard of the Board or this Court. As the Court points out, there are things an employer may do for business reasons which are inconsistent with a rigid or literal interpretation of employee rights under the Act, such as the right to hire strike replacements. Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n. But there are just as clearly others which he may not. Republic \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 326]\n\u00a0\n Aviation, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n; Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S. 221\n; Burnup & Sims, \n379 \nU.S. 21\n. A literal interpretation will not suffice to reconcile these cases, nor to justify the result in the present case. For in saying an employer may lock out all his employees, the Court fully ignores the most explicit statutory right of employees \"to refrain from any or all [concerted] activities.\" Nor can these cases be explained by the Court's test that employer conduct is not proscribed unless it is \"inherently so prejudicial to union interests and so devoid of significant economic justification,\" ante, at 311, that true motivation need not be independently shown. The test is clearly one of choosing among several motivations or purposes and weighing the respective interests of employers and employees. And I think that is the standard the Court applies to the bargaining lockout in this case, but without heeding the fact the balance is for the Board to strike in the first instance.\n\nThe Board's role in this area is a \"delicate task, reflected in part in decisions of this Court, of weighing the interests of employees in concerted activity against the interest of the employer in operating his business in a particular manner.\" Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S., at 229\n. Its decisions are not immune from attack in this Court. Its findings must be supported by substantial evidence and its explication must fit the case before it, be adequate, and be based upon the policy of the Act and an acceptable reading of industrial realities. I would reverse the Board's decision here because it has not articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made. \"This is not to deprecate, but to vindicate (see Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n), the administrative process, for the purpose of the rule is to avoid `propel[ling] the court into the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.' \n332 \nU.S., at 196\n.\" Burlington Truck \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 327]\n\u00a0\n Lines v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 156, 169\n. It is to ask the Board to show that it has exercised the discretion which it has under the Act. Such insistence on a reasoned decision is a foremost function of judicial review, especially where conflicting significant interests are sought to be accommodated. Compare Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80\n, with Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194\n. But this function is not to reject the Board's reasoned assessment of the impact of a particular economic weapon on employee rights. It is certainly not to restrike the balance which the Board has reached.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the result.\n\nI concur in the Court's conclusion that the employer's lockout in this case was not a violation of either 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1) and (3) (1958 ed.), and I therefore join in the judgment reversing the Court of Appeals. I reach this result not for the Court's reasons, but because, from the plain facts revealed by the record, it is crystal clear that the employer's lockout here was justifiable. The very facts recited by the Court in its opinion show that this employer locked out its employees in the face of a threatened strike under circumstances where, had the choice of timing been left solely to the unions, the employer and its customers would have been subject to economic injury over and beyond the loss of business normally incident to a strike upon the termination of the collective bargaining agreement. A lockout under these circumstances has been recognized by the Board itself to be justifiable and not a violation of the labor statutes. Betts Cadillac Olds, Inc., 96 N. L. R. B. 268; see Packard Bell Electronics Corp., 130 N. L. R. B. 1122; International Shoe Co., 93 N. L. R. B. 907; Duluth \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 328]\n\u00a0\n Bottling Assn., 48 N. L. R. B. 1335; Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., 121 N. L. R. B. 334, 337.\n\nThe trial examiner for the Labor Board found that the employer reasonably and \"honestly believed that a strike might take place immediately, or when a vessel was docked, or that bargaining would be delayed until closer to the winter months when Respondent would be more vulnerable,\" 142 N. L. R. B., at 1382, and that the company \"by its actions, therefore, did not violate . . . the Act,\" 142 N. L. R. B., at 1383. The Board did not dispute the trial examiner's finding that the employer in fact believed that a strike was threatened. Nor did it deny that if the employer reasonably believed that \"there was a real strike threat,\" the lockout would be justified. 142 N. L. R. B., at 1364. The Board, however, rejected the ultimate finding of the trial examiner because it disagreed with his conclusion that the employer \"had reasonable grounds to fear a strike.\" (Emphasis added.) 142 N. L. R. B., at 1363. The Court of Appeals in a single sentence sustained the Board's holding on this point concluding, without detailed analysis, \"that the Board's finding that respondent had no reasonable basis for fearing a strike is not without the requisite record support.\" 331 F.2d 839, 840. In my view the Board's conclusion that the employer's admitted fear of a strike was unreasonable is not only without the requisite record support but is at complete variance with \"the actualities of industrial relations,\" Labor Board v. Steelworkers, \n357 \nU.S. 357, 364\n, which the Board is to take into account in effectuating the national labor policy.\n\nWe do not deal with a case in which the facts are disputed and the Board has resolved testimonial controversies. The facts here are undisputed, and a review of them demonstrates that the employer's fear of a strike at a time strategically selected by the unions to cause \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 329]\n\u00a0\n it maximum damage and to give the unions the maximum economic advantage was totally reasonable.\n\nThe employer company is primarily engaged in repairing ships and operates four shipyards on the Great Lakes at Buffalo, New York, Lorain and Toledo, Ohio, and South Chicago, Illinois. As the Court points out, the employer's business is highly seasonal, concentrated in the winter months when the Great Lakes are frozen over and shipping is impossible. Speed is of the utmost importance in this business, for the shipping season is short and the tie-up of a ship for several weeks during the season or a delay in a ship's re-entry into service in the spring produces a severe economic impact. A work stoppage while a ship is in the yards can have serious economic consequences both for the employer and for his customers. Customers are justifiably wary of entrusting their ships to the yards at a time when a collective bargaining dispute is unresolved. For this reason the expiration date of a contract in situations such as this is a vital issue in collective bargaining. The employer seeks an expiration date during the slack season; the union seeks an expiration date during the busy season. In this case as a result of past bargaining, the employer's contract expired on August 1, rather than during the busy season.\n\nFrom 1952 until 1961, when the negotiations now under consideration began, the employer had negotiated five times with the eight unions here involved, and it had experienced exactly one strike per negotiation. The strikes in 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956 lasted about three weeks each, and the 1958 strike continued for 10 weeks. In 1955 employees had engaged in a slowdown before the agreement expired and thereby caught an $8,000,000 ship in the yard, the use of which was lost to the customer for four weeks during its busiest season. In February 1961, at the height of the busy season, wildcat work stoppages occurred in Chicago and Buffalo. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n\nShortly before May 1961 the unions notified the employer that they wished to modify the contract due to expire on August 1. At the first bargaining meeting on June 6, 1961, the employer spokesman maintained that competitive conditions prevented any increase in wages or benefits. The unions took an opposite view and asked for a substantial increase in pension and other benefits. The parties met on numerous occasions throughout June and July. As the negotiations progressed, the employer receded from its original position and offered improved wages and benefits; the unions receded from some of their demands, but a meeting of the minds was not reached. On July 20 and subsequently, with the August 1 expiration date approaching, the unions proposed a six-month extension of the current contract. This would have given the unions an expiration date at a time most advantageous to them; the employer rejected this proposal on the grounds that the contract would then expire on February 1, 1962, the very height of its busy season, and that no customer would risk its ships by putting them in the company's yards knowing that the labor contract was about to expire. On July 28 the unions' negotiator informed the employer that the union members had voted \"overwhelmingly to take a strike if necessary.\" On July 31 the employer made a new and increased offer on wages and benefits, asked that its proposals be submitted to the employees for a vote and offered to extend the contract for the limited period sufficient to enable this vote to be taken. The unions in turn asked that the labor agreement be extended indefinitely until a new agreement was reached. The employer refused to agree to an indefinite extension of its present contract on the ground that it could then be struck at any time of the unions' choosing.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough the contract expired on August 1, the unions did not call a strike on that date but continued to work \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 331]\n\u00a0\n on a day-to-day basis and submitted the employer's revised offer to a vote of the membership. On August 8 the unions informed the employer that its proposals had been \"overwhelmingly\" rejected by the employees. On August 9 the employer made a new package offer on many issues. The union negotiators rejected this new offer, refused to take it to the employees for a vote, and made no counteroffer. Negotiations were broken off without any definite plans for further meetings between the parties. Future meetings were left to the call of a federal mediator.\n\nFaced with the situation of an expired contract and the unions free to strike at any time, in particular at a time of their own choosing during the busy season, or whenever the yard was filled with ships, the employer decided to shut down the Chicago yard completely and lay off all but two employees at Toledo. Notices were issued to employees at Chicago, Toledo, and to some in Buffalo, which stated, \"Because of the labor dispute which has been unresolved since August 1, 1961, you are laid off until further notice.\" Negotiations were resumed after this lockout and continued until agreement was reached on October 27. The laid off employees were then recalled to work. Since then the parties have engaged in other negotiations and have agreed upon contracts without either strike or lockout.\n\nOn this record the trial examiner held that the employer reasonably feared that the unions would strike when the time was ripe. He found that the employer reasonably believed that:\n\n \"[t]he Unions' strategy was:\n\n\n  \"Keep working at Lorain, keep the nonproductive  men on the payroll as long as possible at the other  yards until one of two things occurred: (a) A shipowner  would send a ship into one of the yards, and  then by striking, the Respondent would be forced to  his knees in effecting a labor settlement satisfactory  to the Union, and if this didn't occur, then, (b) continue \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 332]\n\u00a0\n  to bargain, into the winter months, and then  execute an agreement effective in November, December,  January, or February, and in this way, when the  agreement was reopened, Respondent would be sure  to have ships in its docks, and a strike at such a time  would bring the Respondent to his knees in effecting  an agreement.\" 142 N. L. R. B., at 1381.\n\n\n Accordingly the trial examiner held that no unfair labor practice was committed. This holding followed settled Board doctrine that \"lockouts are permissible to safeguard against unusual operational problems or hazards or economic loss where there is reasonable ground for believing that a strike [is] . . . threatened or imminent.\" Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., supra, at 337.\n\nThe Board overturned the trial examiner's ultimate holding, reaching what, on this record, is a totally unsupportable conclusion - that the employer's fear of a strike was unreasonable. The Board rested its conclusion upon the grounds that \"the Unions made every effort to convey to the Respondent their intention not to strike; and they also gave assurances that if a strike were called, any work brought into Respondent's yard before the strike would be completed. The Unions further offered to extend the existing contract [which contained a no-strike provision] for 6 months, or indefinitely, until contract terms were reached . . . .\" 142 N. L. R. B., at 1364. Upon analysis it is clear that none of these grounds will support the Board's conclusion that the employer had no reasonable basis to fear a strike.\n\nThe Board's finding that \"the Unions made every effort to convey to the Respondent their intention not to strike\" is based upon statements made by union negotiators during the course of the negotiations. The chief negotiator for the unions testified that on the first day of negotiations, \"I stated that it was my understanding that \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 333]\n\u00a0\n in the past there seemed to have been a strike at every - during every negotiation since World War II from information I had received, and it was our sincere hope that we could negotiate this agreement - go through those negotiations and negotiate a new agreement without any strife, that personally I always had a strong dislike to strike and that I thought if two parties sincerely desired to reach an agreement, one could be reached without strike. The Company . . . stated that the Company concurred in those thoughts, that they too disliked strikes, and it was their hope, also, that an agreement could be reached amicably.\"\n2\n The negotiators for the unions expressed this same sentiment on several other occasions during the negotiations.\n\nThese statements, which one would normally expect a union agent to make during the course of negotiations as a hopeful augury of their outcome rather than as a binding agreement not to strike, scarcely vitiate the reasonableness of the employer's fear of a strike in light of the long history of past strikes by the same unions. Further, they cannot be deemed to render the employer's fear of a strike unreasonable after the negotiations had reached an impasse, particularly in view of the fact that a strike vote had been taken by the unions' membership, and the membership rather than the union representatives had final authority to determine whether a strike would take place.\n\nThe fact that the assistant business managers of Local 85 and Local 374 of the Boilermakers Union \"gave assurances \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 334]\n\u00a0\n that if a strike were called, any work brought into Respondent's yard before the strike would be completed\"\n3\n likewise cannot be deemed to offset the unions' threat of a strike and its consequences. These men were officials of locals in only one of the eight separate unions involved. At most they could give assurances as to a few of the men at two of the company's four yards. And even had all of the unions joined in these statements, which was not the case, the employer had been subject to wildcat strikes at a time when the unions were bound by a no-strike clause in their contract. Therefore, without impugning the good faith of these union agents, it surely was not unreasonable for the employer, notwithstanding this assurance, to fear that its employees might not complete work on ships when they were not bound by a no-strike clause.\n\nThe Board also relies on the fact that the unions offered a six-month extension of the present contract. As I have already pointed out, this would have caused the contract to expire during the employer's busiest season. The employer had a perfect right to reject this stratagem. Had it agreed, the unions would have achieved one of their important objectives without the necessity of striking. By the same token it is clear that the unions would have agreed not to strike had the employer accepted their proposals for increases in wages and benefits. Surely the employer had every right to reject these proposals, and its rejection of them would not show that it was unreasonable in fearing a strike based upon its failure to accede to the unions' demands.\n\nFinally, the offer of an indefinite extension of the contract is an equally unsupportable basis for the Board's conclusion. An indefinite extension presumably would mean under traditional contract theory that the unions could \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 335]\n\u00a0\n strike at any time or after giving brief notice.\n4\n Surely the employer would be reasonable in fearing that such an arrangement would peculiarly place the timing of the strike in the unions' hands.\n\nThe sum of all this is that the record does not supply even a scintilla of, let alone any substantial, evidence to support the conclusion of the Board that the employer's fear of a strike was unreasonable, but, rather, this conclusion appears irrational. Cf. Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n, at 236. I would therefore hold on this record that the employer's lockout was completely justified.\n\nThe fact that the Board held on the undisputed facts that the employer's fear of a strike was unreasonable and that the Court of Appeals has affirmed the Board does not preclude us from reviewing this determination. See Public Service Comm'n v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 421\n. The standard that should have been applied by the Court of Appeals was whether the Board's finding was supported by substantial evidence when the record was viewed as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n. See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 156, 168\n; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. J-T Transport Co., \n368 \nU.S. 81, 93\n. \"The Board's findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board's decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\" Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, supra, at 490. Indeed, the Board here set aside the report of its trial examiner, and in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 336]\n\u00a0\n Universal Camera this Court recognized \"that evidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board's than when he has reached the same conclusion.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 496\n. The Court of Appeals in my view in its summary affirmance on this issue grossly misapplied the standards laid down by Universal Camera. This case is properly before us on a substantial legal question, which necessarily involves a review of the entire record. In making such a review, although we give proper weight to what the first reviewing court decides, we cannot ignore our duty to apply the statutory standard that the Board's findings must be supported by substantial evidence. Since the Board's holding was not so supported, but, on the contrary, as the plain facts of the record reveal, was irrational, I would reverse the Court of Appeals on this ground.\n\nMy view of this case would make it unnecessary to deal with the broad question of whether an employer may lock out his employees solely to bring economic pressure to bear in support of his bargaining position. The question of which types of lockout are compatible with the labor statute is a complex one as this decision and the other cases decided today illustrate. See Textile Workers Union v. Darlington Mfg. Co., ante, p. 263; Labor Board v. Brown, ante, p. 278. This Court has said that the problem of the legality of certain types of strike activity must be \"revealed by unfolding variant situations\" and requires \"an evolutionary process for its rational response, not a quick, definitive formula as a comprehensive answer.\" Electrical Workers v. Labor Board, \n366 \nU.S. 667, 674\n; see also Labor Board v. Steelworkers, supra, 362-363. The same is true of lockouts.\n\nThe types of situation in which an employer might seek to lock out his employees differ considerably one from \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 337]\n\u00a0\n the other. This case presents the situation of an employer with a long history of union recognition and collective bargaining, confronted with a history of past strikes, which locks out only after considerable good-faith negotiation involving agreement and compromise on numerous issues, after a bargaining impasse has been reached, more than a week after the prior contract has expired, and when faced with the threat of a strike at a time when it and the property of its customers can suffer unusual harm. Other cases in which the Board has held a lockout illegal have presented far different situations. For example, in Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., supra, an employer locked out its employees the day after its contract with the union expired although no impasse had been reached in the bargaining still in progress, no strike had been threatened by the unions, which had never called a sudden strike during the 13 years they had bargained with the employer, and the unions had offered to resubmit the employer's proposals to its employees for a vote. See also Utah Plumbing & Heating Contractors Assn., 126 N. L. R. B. 973. These decisions of the Labor Board properly take into account, in determining the legality of lockouts under the labor statutes, such factors as the length, character, and history of the collective bargaining relation between the union and the employer, as well as whether a bargaining impasse has been reached. Indeed, the Court itself seems to recognize that there is a difference between locking out before a bargaining impasse has been reached and locking out after collective bargaining has been exhausted, for it limits its holding to lockouts in the latter type of situation without deciding the question of the legality of locking out before bargaining is exhausted. Since the examples of different lockout situations could be multiplied, the logic of the Court's limitation of its holding should lead it to recognize that the problem of lockouts requires \"an evolutionary \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 338]\n\u00a0\n process,\" not \"a quick, definitive formula,\" for its answer.\n\nThe Court should be chary of sweeping generalizations in this complex area. When we deal with the lockout and the strike, we are dealing with weapons of industrial warfare. While the parties generally have their choice of economic weapons, see Labor Board v. Insurance Agents, \n361 \nU.S. 477\n, this choice, with respect to both the strike and the lockout, is not unrestricted. While we have recognized \"the deference paid the strike weapon by the federal labor laws,\" Labor Board v. Erie Resistor, supra, at 235, not all forms of economically motivated strikes are protected or even permissible under the labor statutes\n5\n or the prior decisions of this Court.\n6\n Moreover, a lockout prompted by an antiunion motive is plainly illegal under the National Labor Relations Act,\n7\n though no similar restrictions as to motive operate to limit the legality of a strike. See Labor Board v. Somerset Shoe Co., 111 F.2d 681; Labor Board v. Stremel, 141 F.2d 317; Labor Board v. Somerset Classics, Inc., 193 F.2d 613. The varieties of restrictions imposed upon strikes and lockouts reflect the complexities presented by variant factual situations.\n\nThe Court not only overlooks the factual diversity among different types of lockout, but its statement of the rules governing unfair labor practices under 8 (a) (1) and (3) does not give proper recognition to the fact that \"[t]he ultimate problem [in this area] is the balancing \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 339]\n\u00a0\n of the conflicting legitimate interests.\" Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 96\n. The Court states that employer conduct, not actually motivated by antiunion bias,\n8\n does not violate 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3) unless it is \"demonstrably so destructive of collective bargaining,\" ante, at 309, or \"so prejudicial to union interests and so devoid of significant economic justification,\" ante, at 311, that no antiunion animus need be shown. This rule departs substantially from both the letter and the spirit of numerous prior decisions of the Court. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra, at 96; Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n; Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., \n351 \nU.S. 105\n; Labor Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., \n379 \nU.S. 21\n.\n\nThese decisions demonstrate that the correct test for determining whether 8 (a) (1) has been violated in cases not involving an employer antiunion motive is whether the business justification for the employer's action outweighs the interference with 7 rights involved. In Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, supra, for example, the Court affirmed a Board holding that a company \"no-solicitation\" rule was invalid as applied to prevent solicitation of employees on company property during periods when employees were free to do as they pleased, not because such a rule was \"demonstrably . . . destructive of collective bargaining,\" but simply because there was no significant employer justification for the rule and there was a showing of union interest, though far short of a necessity, in its abolition. See also, Labor Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., supra. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 340]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA similar test is applicable in 8 (a) (3) cases where no antiunion motive is shown. The Court misreads Radio Officers v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17\n, and Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, in stating that the test in such cases under 8 (a) (3) is whether practices \"are inherently so prejudicial to union interests and so devoid of significant economic justification that no specific evidence of intent to discourage union membership or other antiunion animus is required.\" Ante, at 311. Radio Officers did not restrict the application of 8 (a) (3) in cases devoid of antiunion motive to the extreme situations encompassed by the Court's test. Rather, in holding applicable the common-law rule that a man is presumed to intend the foreseeable consequences of his own actions, the Court extended the reach of 8 (a) (3) to all cases in which a significant antiunion effect is foreseeable regardless of the employer's motive. In such cases the Court, in Erie Resistor Corp., held that conduct might be determined by the Board to violate 8 (a) (3) where the Board's determination resulted from a reasonable \"weighing [of] the interests of employees in concerted activity against the interest of the employer in operating his business in a particular manner and . . . [from] balancing in the light of the Act and its policy the intended consequences upon employee rights against the business ends to be served by the employer's conduct.\" \n373 \nU.S., at 229\n.\n\nThese cases show that the tests as to whether an employer's conduct violates 8 (a) (1) or violates 8 (a) (3) without a showing of antiunion motive come down to substantially the same thing: whether the legitimate economic interests of the employer justify his interference with the rights of his employees - a test involving \"the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests.\" Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra, at 96. As the prior decisions of this Court have held, \"[t]he function of striking . . . [such a] balance . . . often a difficult and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 341]\n\u00a0\n delicate responsibility, . . . Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\" Ibid.\n\nThis, of course, does not mean that reviewing courts are to abdicate their function of determining whether, giving due deference to the Board, the Board has struck the balance consistently with the language and policy of the Act. See Labor Board v. Brown, supra; Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra. Nor does it mean that reviewing courts are to rubber-stamp decisions of the Board where the application of principles in a particular case is irrational or not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Applying these principles to the factual situation here presented, I would accept the Board's carefully limited rule, fashioned by the Board after weighing the \"conflicting legitimate interests\" of employers and unions, that a lockout does not violate the Act where used to \"safeguard against unusual operational problems or hazards or economic loss where there is reasonable ground for believing that a strike [is] . . . threatened or imminent.\" Quaker State Oil Refining Corp., supra, at 337. This rule is consistent with the policies of the Act and based upon the actualities of industrial relations. I would, however, reject the determination of the Board refusing to apply this rule to this case, for the undisputed facts revealed by the record bring this case clearly within the rule.\n\nIn view of the necessity for, and the desirability of, weighing the legitimate conflicting interests in variant lockout situations, there is not and cannot be any simple formula which readily demarks the permissible from the impermissible lockout. This being so, I would not reach out in this case to announce principles which are determinative of the legality of all economically motivated lockouts whether before or after a bargaining impasse has \n\n[380 \nU.S. 300, 342]\n\u00a0\n been reached. In my view both the Court and the Board, in reaching their opposite conclusions, have inadvisably and unnecessarily done so here. Rather, I would confine our decision to the simple holding, supported by both the record and the actualities of industrial relations, that the employer's fear of a strike was reasonable, and therefore, under the settled decisions of the Board, which I would approve, the lockout of its employees was justified.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See note 4, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This same negotiator also testified as follows: \"Q. Did you say that the company was crying about not being able to afford a wage increase and yet did you say that in 1958 the company used the same argument and that a ten or a twelve week strike ensued at the conclusion of which an eight cent an hour increase was granted for each of three years and that the company was still not out of business? \"A.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a companion case to No. 95, Linkletter v. Walker, ante, p. 618. Petitioner was convicted in a New York State court in 1951 for possession of narcotics with intent to sell. On December 21, 1950, two detectives attached to the Narcotics Squad of the New York City Police Department entered petitioner's apartment by a door opened by a painter who was just leaving. They ignored the protest of petitioner and proceeded, without a warrant, to search the apartment. Upon entering, one of the officers called an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. After two federal agents arrived the local and federal officers made a thorough search of the apartment. One of the local officers found 54 cellophane envelopes, 106 empty capsules, a box of staples and a scale. A federal agent found four packages under a hat. Analysis revealed that three of the packets contained heroin and the other contained cocaine. These items were introduced in evidence at the state trial without objection of petitioner's counsel. Nor was objection made to the participation of the federal narcotics agents in the investigation. After conviction petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division but the appeal was dismissed in March of 1952.\n\nIn August 1961, after Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n, was decided, petitioner resorted to state post-conviction remedies claiming that the evidence found in his apartment and introduced against him had been illegally seized and that his conviction had therefore been obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Upon seeking habeas corpus in the United States District Court on the same grounds his application was denied. The \n\n[381 \nU.S. 654, 656]\n\u00a0\n trial judge refused to apply Mapp retrospectively. The Court of Appeals sitting en banc affirmed by a divided vote. 333 F.2d 12. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 815\n (1964), and set this case for argument with Linkletter, supra. That case answers petitioner's point as to the retrospective application of Mapp.\n\nHowever, petitioner also contends that the participation of federal narcotics agents in the search and seizure requires reversal here, citing Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n (1956). We cannot agree. That case invoked the supervisory power of a federal court over a federal law enforcement officer and we held that the latter might be enjoined from appearing in a state trial for the purpose of offering evidence previously seized by him illegally as a federal officer and so found by a federal court. But even if an exclusionary rule were fashioned to bar use of the federal agent's testimony in the absence of a federal court restraint, the petitioner would be entitled to no relief. Such an exclusionary rule would depend upon the reasons given in Mapp and under Linkletter, supra, would not have retrospective application.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in MR. JUSTICE BLACK'S dissenting opinion in Linkletter v. Walker, ante, p. 640. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 654, 657]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMSTRONG v. MANZO(1965)\nNo. 149\nArgued: March 9, 1965Decided: April 27, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner and his wife were divorced by a Texas court. Custody of their only child was granted to the respondent mother and petitioner was ordered to pay a monthly sum for the child's support. The mother thereafter married respondent Manzo, who two years later sought to become the child's adoptive father. State law requires the natural father's written consent to adoption, an exception existing if he has not substantially contributed to the child's support for two years commensurate with his financial ability. In that case the written consent of the juvenile court judge in the county of the child's residence may be accepted. The mother filed an affidavit in her county juvenile court alleging petitioner's failure for more than two years to contribute to the child's support and the judge consented to the adoption. Respondents the same day filed an adoption petition alleging that the natural father's consent was not necessary because he had not contributed to the child's support commensurate with his ability for a period of over two years and that the juvenile court judge had given his written consent. No notice of the affidavit or adoption petition was given to petitioner, though his whereabouts were well known to respondents. An adoption decree was later entered making Manzo the child's adoptive father, upon being advised of which petitioner filed a motion seeking to have the court annul its decree. A hearing was held at which petitioner introduced evidence that he had not failed to contribute to his child's support but the court denied petitioner's motion. The appellate court affirmed notwithstanding petitioner's contention of deprivation of due process of law because of entry of the decree without notice, and the state supreme court refused review. Held:\n\n 1. Failure to give petitioner notice of the pending adoption proceedings deprived him of his rights without due process of law. P. 550.\n\n\n 2. The hearing subsequently granted to petitioner did not remove the constitutional infirmity since petitioner was forced to assume burdens of proof which, had he been accorded notice of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n adoption proceedings, would have rested upon the moving parties. Pp. 550-552.\n\n\n 371 S. W. 2d 407, reversed and remanded.\n\nEwell Lee Smith, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Eugene L. Smith and Ed M. Brown.\n\nWilliam Duncan argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Eugene T. Edwards.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, R. Wright Armstrong, Jr., and his wife were divorced by a Texas court in 1959. Custody of their only child, Molly Page Armstrong, was awarded to Mrs. Armstrong, and the petitioner was granted \"the privilege of visiting with said child at reasonable times, places, and intervals.\" The divorce decree ordered the petitioner to pay $50 a month for his daughter's support. In 1960 Mrs. Armstrong married the respondent, Salvatore E. Manzo. Two years later the Manzos filed a petition for adoption in the District Court of El Paso County, Texas, seeking to make Salvatore Manzo the legal father of Molly Page Armstrong.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nTexas law provides that an adoption such as this one shall not be permitted without the written consent of the child's natural father, except in certain specified circumstances. One such exceptional circumstance is if the father \"shall have not contributed substantially to the support of such child during [a] period of two (2) years commensurate with his financial ability.\" In that event, the written consent of the judge of the juvenile court of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n the county of the child's residence may be accepted by the adoption court in lieu of the father's consent.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nPreliminary to filing the adoption petition, Mrs. Manzo filed an affidavit in the juvenile court, alleging in conclusory terms that the petitioner had \"failed to contribute to the support of\" Molly Page Armstrong \"for a period in excess of two years preceding this date.\" No notice was given to the petitioner of the filing of this affidavit, although the Manzos well knew his precise whereabouts in Fort Worth, Texas. On the basis of the affidavit, and without, so far as the record shows, a hearing of any kind, the juvenile court judge promptly issued his consent to the adoption. In the adoption petition, filed later the same day, the Manzos alleged that \"consent of the natural father, R. W. Armstrong, Jr., to the adoption herein sought is not necessary upon grounds that the said father has not contributed to the support of said minor child commensurate with his ability to do so for a period in excess of two (2) years, and the Judge of a Juvenile Court \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n of El Paso County, Texas . . . has consented in writing to said adoption.\" No notice of any kind was given to the petitioner of the filing or pendency of this adoption petition.\n\nAn investigator appointed by the court made a detailed written report recommending the adoption, and a few weeks later the adoption decree was entered. The decree provided in accord with Texas law that \"all legal relationship and all rights and duties between such Child and the natural father shall cease and determine, and such Child is hereafter deemed and held to be for every purpose the child of its parent by adoption, as fully as though naturally born to him in lawful wedlock.\"\n3\n and further provided that \"the said Molly Page Armstrong shall be known by the Christian and Surname as Molly Page Manzo, from this day forward.\"\n\nDuring this entire period the petitioner was not given, and did not have, the slightest inkling of the pendency of these adoption proceedings. On the day the decree was entered, however, Salvatore Manzo wrote to the petitioner's father, advising him that \"I have this date completed court action to adopt Molly Page as my daughter and to change her name to Molly Page Manzo.\" The petitioner's father immediately relayed this news to the petitioner, who promptly filed a motion in the District Court of El Paso County, asking that the adoption decree be \"set aside and annulled and a new trial granted,\" upon the ground that he had been given no notice of the adoption proceedings.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe court did not vacate the adoption decree, but set a date for hearing on the motion. At that hearing the petitioner introduced evidence, through witnesses and by depositions, in an effort to show that he had not failed to contribute to his daughter's support \"commensurate with his financial ability.\"\n5\n At the conclusion of the hearing the court entered an order denying the petitioner's motion and providing that the \"adoption decree entered herein is in all things confirmed.\"\n\nThe petitioner appealed to the appropriate Texas court of civil appeals, upon the ground, among others, that the trial court had erred in not setting aside the adoption decree, because the entry of the decree without notice to the petitioner had deprived him \"of his child without due process of law.\" The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment,\n6\n and the Supreme Court of Texas refused an application for writ of error.\n\nWe granted certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 816\n. The questions before us are whether failure to notify the petitioner of the pendency of the adoption proceedings deprived him \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n of due process of law so as to render the adoption decree constitutionally invalid, and, if so, whether the subsequent hearing on the petitioner's motion to set aside the decree served to cure its constitutional invalidity.\n\n  In disposing of the first issue, there is no occasion to linger long. It is clear that failure to give the petitioner notice of the pending adoption proceedings violated the most rudimentary demands of due process of law. \"Many controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\" Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306\n, at 313. \"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Milliken v. Meyer, \n311 \nU.S. 457\n; Grannis v. Ordean, \n234 \nU.S. 385\n; Priest v. Las Vegas, \n232 \nU.S. 604\n; Roller v. Holly, \n176 \nU.S. 398\n. . . .\" Id., at 314. Questions frequently arise as to the adequacy of a particular form of notice in a particular case. See, e. g., Schroeder v. City of New York, \n371 \nU.S. 208\n; New York v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n344 \nU.S. 293\n; Walker v. Hutchinson City, \n352 \nU.S. 112\n; Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co., supra. But as to the basic requirement of notice itself there can be no doubt, where, as here, the result of the judicial proceeding was permanently to deprive a legitimate parent of all that parenthood implies. Cf. May v. Anderson, \n345 \nU.S. 528, 533\n.\n\nThe Texas Court of Civil Appeals implicitly recognized this constitutional rule, but held, in accord with its understanding \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 551]\n\u00a0\n of the Texas precedents,\n7\n that whatever constitutional infirmity resulted from the failure to give the petitioner notice had been cured by the hearing subsequently afforded to him upon his motion to set aside the decree. 371 S. W. 2d, at 412. We cannot agree.\n\nHad the petitioner been given the timely notice which the Constitution requires, the Manzos, as the moving parties, would have had the burden of proving their case as against whatever defenses the petitioner might have interposed. See Jones v. Willson, 285 S. W. 2d 877; Ex parte Payne, 301 S. W. 2d 194. It would have been incumbent upon them to show not only that Salvatore Manzo met all the requisites of an adoptive parent under Texas law, but also to prove why the petitioner's consent to the adoption was not required. Had neither side offered any evidence, those who initiated the adoption proceedings could not have prevailed.\n\nInstead, the petitioner was faced on his first appearance in the courtroom with the task of overcoming an adverse decree entered by one judge, based upon a finding of nonsupport made by another judge. As the record shows, there was placed upon the petitioner the burden of affirmatively showing that he had contributed to the support of his daughter to the limit of his financial ability over the period involved. The burdens thus placed upon the petitioner were real, not purely theoretical. For \"it is plain that where the burden of proof lies may be decisive of the outcome.\" Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 525\n. Yet these burdens would not have been imposed upon him had he been given timely notice in accord with the Constitution. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA fundamental requirement of due process is \"the opportunity to be heard.\" Grannis v. Ordean, \n234 \nU.S. 385, 394\n. It is an opportunity which must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The trial court could have fully accorded this right to the petitioner only by granting his motion to set aside the decree and consider the case anew. Only that would have wiped the slate clean. Only that would have restored the petitioner to the position he would have occupied had due process of law been accorded to him in the first place. His motion should have been granted.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mrs. Manzo joined the petition in order to manifest her consent to the adoption, and also filed a separate written consent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Vernon's Ann. Civ. Stat., Art. 46a, 6, provides in pertinent part as follows: \"Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no adoption shall be permitted except with the written consent of the living parents of the child; provided, however, that if a living parent or parents shall voluntarily abandon and desert a child sought to be adopted, for a period of two (2) years, and shall have left such child to the care, custody, control and management of other persons, or if such parent or parents shall have not contributed substantially to the support of such child during such period of two (2) years commensurate with his financial ability, then, in either event, it shall not be necessary to obtain the written consent of the living parent or parents in such default, and in such cases adoption shall be permitted on the written consent of the Judge of the Juvenile Court of the county of such child's residence; or if there be no Juvenile Court, then on the written consent of the Judge of the County Court of the county of such child's residence.\" The petitioner does not here question the constitutional validity of the substantive provisions of this statute.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Vernon's Ann. Civ. Stat., Art. 46a, 9.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The third paragraph of the petitioner's motion was as follows: \"At the time the above entitled and numbered proceeding came on to be heard and judgment rendered, your Petitioner had never been advised or given notice, actual or constructive, as required by the laws of Texas, that this proceeding was to be heard or that it was \n\n[380 \nU.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n even pending or of the judgment herein until after the rendition of the judgment, nor was any attempt made to notify Petitioner in any way of this proceeding although his address and whereabouts were well known to the parties, in fact the parties to this proceeding deliberately and wrongfully withheld all notice from Petitioner for the expressed purpose of denying him any opportunity to appear, contest and present his defenses to this proceeding; and that Petitioner was prevented from appearing and presenting his defenses not by his own fault or negligence but rather by the deliberate and wrongful acts of the parties to this proceeding.\" The prayer of the motion was as follows: \"Wherefore, Petitioner prays that the judgment and decree entered in this proceeding be in all things vacated, set aside and annulled and a new trial granted.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 371 S.

FTC.(1965)\nNo. 292\nArgued: March 30, 1965Decided: June 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 296, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n The Atlantic Refining Co., a major producer and distributor of gasoline and oil products on the eastern seaboard, agreed with the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the country's largest manufacturer of rubber products, to sponsor the sale of the latter's tires, batteries and accessories (TBA) to its many retail service station dealers and wholesale outlets. Atlantic was primarily responsible for promoting the sale of Goodyear products to its dealers and assisting in their resale, for which it received a commission on all sales made to the wholesalers and dealers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enjoined the use of direct methods of coercion by Atlantic on its dealers in the inauguration and promotion of the plan, and Atlantic does not seek review of this aspect of the case. The FTC also found the sales-commission plan illegal as a classic example of the use of economic power in one market to destroy competition in another, and prohibited both Atlantic and Goodyear from participating in such arrangements. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. Where Congress has empowered the FTC to determine whether the methods, acts or practices of competition are unfair, the function of the courts is to determine whether the FTC's decision is warranted by the record and has a reasonable basis in law. Pp. 367-368.\n\n\n 2. The record contains substantial evidence to support the FTC's findings. Pp. 368-369.\n\n\n (a) Atlantic and its dealers did not bargain as equals, in the light of Atlantic's leverage of short-term leases, equipment loans to dealers, control of gasoline and oil supplies, and control of dealer advertising. P. 368.\n\n\n (b) Atlantic not only exercised the persuasion that resulted from its economic power, but coupled it with threats of reprisal which the FTC enjoined. P. 368. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) The effectiveness of Atlantic's sponsorship of Goodyear's products is measured by the increase in sales soon after the plan was put in operation. Pp. 368-369.\n\n\n 3. A violation of 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act consists of conduct contrary to the public policy declared in the Act, and the FTC may use as a guideline recognized violations of the antitrust laws. Pp. 369-371.\n\n\n (a) The FTC found that the sales-commission plan impaired competition at all three levels of the TBA industry: manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing. P. 370.\n\n\n (b) The FTC was warranted in finding that the plan, which had a substantial effect on commerce, had the same effect as though Atlantic had agreed to, and did, require its dealers to buy Goodyear products. P. 370.\n\n\n (c) Since the effect of the plan is similar to that of a tie-in, it is not necessary to embark on a full-scale economic analysis of competitive effect. P. 371.\n\n\n (d) In view of the destructive effect on commerce of the widespread use of the sales-commission plan, the FTC was justified in refusing to consider evidence of business justification for the program. P. 371.\n\n\n 4. The FTC's order prohibiting each petitioner from entering into or performing any similar agreement is not unreasonable. Pp. 372-377.\n\n\n (a) It is within the FTC's authority to determine that the long existence of the plan, coupled with Atlantic's coercion of its dealers, warranted a complete prohibition of the practice by Atlantic. Pp. 372-373.\n\n\n (b) Goodyear was an active participant in carrying out the sales-commission plan and the prohibition directed against it is within the FTC's power. Pp. 373-375.\n\n\n (c) There was ample evidence, including 9 sales-commission agreements with other oil companies which the FTC found to be substantially identical with the Atlantic-Goodyear contract, of Goodyear's conduct for more than 14 years aimed at using oil company power structures to curtail competition in TBA. The FTC could conclude therefrom that such conduct required proscribing the use of the sales-commission plan by Goodyear.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has found that an agreement between the Atlantic Refining Company (Atlantic) and the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear), under which the former \"sponsors\" the sale of the tires, batteries and accessory (TBA) products of the latter to its wholesale outlets and its retail service station dealers, is an unfair method of competition in violation of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45 (1964 ed.).\n1\n Under the plan Atlantic sponsors the sale of Goodyear products to its wholesale and retail outlets on an overall commission basis. Goodyear is responsible for its sales and sells at its own price to Atlantic wholesalers and dealers for resale; it bears all of the cost of distribution through its warehouses, stores and other supply points and carries on a joint sales promotion program with Atlantic. The latter, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n however, is primarily responsible for promoting the sale of Goodyear products to its dealers and assisting them in their resale; for this it receives a commission on all sales made to its wholesalers and dealers. The hearing examiner, with the approval of the Commission and the Court of Appeals, enjoined the use of direct methods of coercion on the part of Atlantic upon its dealers in the inauguration and promotion of the plan. Atlantic does not seek review of this phase of the case. However, the Commission considered the coercive practices to be symptomatic of a more fundamental restraint of trade and found the sales-commission plan illegal in itself as \"a classic example of the use of economic power in one market . . . to destroy competition in another market . . . .\" 58 F. T. C. 309, 367. It prohibited Atlantic from participating in any such commission arrangement.\n2\n Similarly, it forbade \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n Goodyear from continuing the arrangement with Atlantic or any other oil company.\n3\n Goodyear and Atlantic filed separate appeals. The Court of Appeals approved the findings of the Commission and affirmed its order. \"Appraising \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 363]\n\u00a0\n the broader aspects of the system [used by Atlantic and Goodyear] as a tying arrangement,\" it agreed with the Commission that it injured \"competition in the distribution of TBA at the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail levels.\" 331 F.2d 394, 402. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 943\n, because of the importance of the questions raised and especially in light of the holding of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Texaco, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 366, 336 F.2d 754, which is in apparent conflict with these cases. We affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSince Atlantic has not sought review of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Commission's order as to its use of overt acts of coercion on its wholesalers and retailers those portions of the order are final. We therefore do not set out in detail all of the facts which are so carefully examined in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\n\nAtlantic is a major producer, refiner and distributor of oil and its by-products. Its market is confined to portions of 17 States along the eastern seaboard.\n4\n Its distribution system consists of wholesale distributors who purchase gasoline and lubricants in large quantities and retail service station operators who do business either as lessees of Atlantic or as contract dealers selling its products. In 1955 Atlantic had 2,493 lessee dealers, who purchased 39.1% of its gasoline sales, and 3,044 contract dealers, who bought 18.1%.\n5\n About half of the contract \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 364]\n\u00a0\n dealers were service station operators; the remainder were operators of garages, grocery stores and other outlets which sell gasoline but do not handle tires, batteries and accessories.\n\nGoodyear is the largest manufacturer of rubber products in the United States with sales of over $1,000,000,000 in 1954. It distributes tires, tubes and accessories through 57 warehouses located throughout the country. It does not warehouse batteries; \"Goodyear\" batteries are tradenamed by it but manufactured and directly distributed to Goodyear outlets by the Electric Auto-Lite Company and Gould-National Batteries, Inc. Goodyear also sells its products at wholesale and retail through about 500 company-owned stores and through numerous independent dealers. These independent franchised dealers number more than 12,000, there being among them a number of Atlantic wholesale petroleum distributors and retail petroleum jobbers. Goodyear has also had a substantial number of nonfranchised dealers which includes most service station customers, including the Atlantic stations involved here.\n\nGasoline service stations are particularly well suited to sell tires, batteries and accessories. They constitute a large and important market for those products. Since at least 1932 Atlantic has been distributing such products to its dealers. In 1951 it inaugurated the sales-commission plan.\n6\n Its contract with Goodyear covered three \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 365]\n\u00a0\n regions: Philadelphia-New Jersey, New York State and New England.\n\nThe Goodyear-Atlantic agreement required Atlantic to assist Goodyear \"to the fullest practicable extent in perfecting sales, credit, and merchandising arrangements\" with all of Atlantic's outlets. This included announcement to its dealers of its sponsorship of Goodyear products followed by a field representative's call to \"suggest . . . the maintenance of adequate stocks of merchandise\" and \"maintenance of proper identification and advertising\" of such merchandise.\n7\n Atlantic was to instruct its salesmen to urge dealers to \"vigorously\" represent Goodyear, and to \"cooperate with and assist\" Goodyear in its \"efforts to promote and increase the sale\" by Atlantic dealers of Goodyear products. And it was to \"maintain adequate dealer training programs in the sale of tires, batteries, and accessories.\" In addition, the companies organized joint sales organization meetings at which plans were made for perfecting the sales plan. One project was a \"double teaming\" solicitation of Atlantic outlets by representatives of both companies to convert them to Goodyear products. They were to call on the dealers together, take stock orders, furnish initial price lists and project future quotas of purchases of Goodyear products. Goodyear also required that each Atlantic dealer be assigned to a supply point maintained by it, such as a warehouse, Goodyear store, independent dealer or designated Atlantic distributor or retail dealer. Atlantic would not receive any commission on purchases made outside of an assigned supply point. Its commission of 10% on sales to Atlantic dealers and 7.5% on sales to its wholesalers was paid on the basis of a master sheet prepared \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n by Goodyear and furnished Atlantic each month. This list was broken down so as to show the individual purchases of each dealer (except those whose supply points for Goodyear products were Atlantic wholesalers). Under this reporting technique, the Commission found, \"Atlantic may determine the exact amount of sponsored TBA purchased by each Atlantic outlet . . . .\" 58 F. T. C. 309, 351. Goodyear also furnished, this time at the specific request of Atlantic, a list of the latter's recalcitrant dealers who refused to be identified with the \"Goodyear Program.\" These lists Atlantic forwarded to its district offices for \"appropriate action.\" On one occasion a list of 46 such dealers was furnished Atlantic officials by Goodyear. The Commission found that \"the entire group . . . was thereafter signed to Goodyear contracts and Goodyear advertising signs were installed at their stations.\" Id., at 346-347.\n\nThe effectiveness of the program is evidenced by the results. Within seven months after the agreement Goodyear had signed up 96% and 98%, respectively, of Atlantic's dealers in two of the three areas assigned to it. In 1952 the sale of Goodyear products to Atlantic dealers was $4,175,890 - 40% higher than Atlantic's sales during the last year of its purchase-resale plan with Lee tires and Exide batteries. By 1955 these sales of Goodyear products amounted to $5,700,121. Total sales of Goodyear and Firestone products from June 1950 to June 1956 were over $52,000,000. This enormous increase, the findings indicate, was the result of the effective policing of the plan. The reports of sales by Goodyear to Atlantic enabled it to know exactly the amount of Goodyear products the great majority of its dealers were buying.\n\nThe Commission stressed the evidence showing that \"Atlantic dealers have been orally advised by sales officials of the oil company that their continued status as Atlantic \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 367]\n\u00a0\n dealers and lessees will be in jeopardy if they do not purchase sufficient quantities of sponsored\" tires, batteries and accessories. Id., at 342. Indeed, some dealers lost their leases after being reported for not complying with the Goodyear sales program. But we need not detail this feature of the case since Atlantic has conceded the point by not perfecting an appeal thereon.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act declares \"[u]nfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair . . . acts or practices in commerce . . . unlawful.\" In a broad delegation of power it empowers the Commission, in the first instance, to determine whether a method of competition or the act or practice complained of is unfair. The Congress intentionally left development of the term \"unfair\" to the Commission rather than attempting to define \"the many and variable unfair practices which prevail in commerce . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 592, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 13. As the conference report stated, unfair competition could best be prevented \"through the action of an administrative body of practical men . . . who will be able to apply the rule enacted by Congress to particular business situations, so as to eradicate evils with the least risk of interfering with legitimate business operations.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1142, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 19. In thus divining that there is no limit to business ingenuity and legal gymnastics the Congress displayed much foresight. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 693\n (1948). Where the Congress has provided that an administrative agency initially apply a broad statutory term to a particular situation, our function is limited to determining whether the Commission's decision \"has `warrant in the record' and a reasonable basis in law.\" Labor Board v. Hearst \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 368]\n\u00a0\n Publications, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 111, 131\n (1944). While the final word is left to the courts, necessarily \"we give great weight to the Commission's conclusion . . . .\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, supra, at 720.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nCertainly there is \"warrant in the record\" for the findings of the Commission here. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that notwithstanding Atlantic's contention that it and its dealers are mutually dependent upon each other, they simply do not bargain as equals. Among the sources of leverage in Atlantic's hands are its lease and equipment loan contracts with their cancellation and short-term provisions. Only last Term we described the power implications of such arrangements in Simpson v. Union Oil Co., \n377 \nU.S. 13\n (1964), and we need not repeat that discussion here. It must also be remembered that Atlantic controlled the supply of gasoline and oil to its wholesalers and dealers. This was an additional source of economic leverage, United States v. Loew's, Inc., \n371 \nU.S. 38, 45\n (1962), as was its extensive control of all advertising on the premises of its dealers.\n\nFurthermore, there was abundant evidence that Atlantic, in some instances with the aid of Goodyear, not only exerted the persuasion that is a natural incident of its economic power, but coupled with it direct and overt threats of reprisal such as are now enjoined by paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order. Indeed, the Commission could properly have concluded that it was for this bundle of persuasion that Goodyear paid Atlantic its commission. We will not repeat the manner in which this sponsorship was carried out. It is sufficient to note that the most impressive evidence of its effectiveness was its undeniable success within a short time of its inception. In 1951, seven months after the sales-commission plan had gone into effect, Goodyear had enjoyed great success in signing \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n contracts with Atlantic dealers despite the fact that a 1946-1949 survey had shown that 67% of the dealers had preferred Lee tires and 76% Exide batteries.\n\nWith this background in mind, we consider whether there was a \"reasonable basis in law\" for the Commission's ultimate conclusion that the sales-commission plan constituted an unfair method of competition.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nAt the outset we must stress what we do not find present here. We recognize that the Goodyear-Atlantic contract is not a tying arrangement. Atlantic is not required to tie its sale of gasoline and other petroleum products to purchases of Goodyear tires, batteries and accessories. Nor does it expressly require such purchases of its dealers. But neither do we understand that either the Commission or the Court of Appeals held that the sales-commission arrangement was a tying scheme. What they did find was that the central competitive characteristic was the same in both cases - the utilization of economic power in one market to curtail competition in another. Here that lever was bolstered by actual threats and coercive practices. As our cases hold, all that is necessary in 5 proceedings to find a violation is to discover conduct that \"runs counter to the public policy declared in the\" Act. Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 463\n (1941). But this is of necessity, and was intended to be, a standard to which the Commission would give substance. In doing so, its use as a guideline of recognized violations of the antitrust laws was, we believe, entirely appropriate. It has long been recognized that there are many unfair methods of competition that do not assume the proportions of antitrust violations. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., \n344 \nU.S. 392, 394\n (1953). When conduct does bear the characteristics \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 370]\n\u00a0\n of recognized antitrust violations it becomes suspect, and the Commission may properly look to cases applying those laws for guidance.\n\nAlthough the Commission relied on such cases here, it expressly rejected a mechanical application of the law of tying arrangements. Rather it looked to the entire record as a basis for its conclusion that the activity of Goodyear and Atlantic impaired competition at three levels of the tires, batteries and accessories industry. It found that wholesalers and manufacturers of competing brands, and even Goodyear wholesalers who were not authorized supply points, were foreclosed from the Atlantic market. In addition, it recognized the obvious fact that Firestone and Goodyear were excluded from selling to Atlantic's dealers in each other's territories. Both of these effects on competition flowed from the contract itself. It also found that the plight of Atlantic wholesalers and retailers was equally clear. They had to compete with other wholesalers and retailers who were free to stock several brands, but they were effectively foreclosed from selling brands other than Goodyear. This restraint is in this respect broader than the one found in International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n (1947), where the dealers could stock other salt if they could buy it at lower prices. Here the dealers could buy only at Goodyear's price.\n\nThus the Commission was warranted in finding that the effect of the plan was as though Atlantic had agreed with Goodyear to require its dealers to buy Goodyear products and had done so. It is beyond question that the effect on commerce was not insubstantial. In International Salt Co., the market foreclosed was $500,000 annually. Firestone and Goodyear sales alone exceeded $11,000,000 in 1955 and $50,000,000 in six years, and more than 5,500 retailers and wholesalers were affected. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 371]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoodyear and Atlantic contend that the Commission should have made a far more extensive economic analysis of the competitive effect of the sales-commission plan, examining the entire market in tires, batteries and accessories. But just as the effect of this plan is similar to that of a tie-in, so is it unnecessary to embark upon a fullscale economic analysis of competitive effect. We think it enough that the Commission found that a not insubstantial portion of commerce is affected. See United States v. Loew's, Inc., \n371 \nU.S. 38, 45\n, n. 4 (1962); International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n (1947).\n\nNor can we say that the Commission erred in refusing to consider evidence of economic justification for the program. While these contracts may well provide Atlantic with an economical method of assuring efficient product distribution among its dealers they also amount to a device that permits suppliers of tires, batteries and accessories, through the use of oil company power, to effectively sew up large markets. Upon considering the destructive effect on commerce that would result from the widespread use of these contracts by major oil companies and suppliers, we conclude that the Commission was clearly justified in refusing the participants an opportunity to offset these evils by a showing of economic benefit to themselves. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1, 6\n-7 (1958).\n\nThe short of it is that Atlantic, with Goodyear's encouragement and assistance, has marshaled its full economic power in a continuing campaign to force its dealers and wholesalers to buy Goodyear products. The anticompetitive effects of this program are clear on the record and render unnecessary extensive economic analysis of market percentages or business justifications in determining whether this was a method of competition which Congress has declared unfair and therefore unlawful. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 372]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the matter of relief. As we have said, the Commission's order forbids Atlantic's participation in any contract with any supplier of tires, batteries and accessories whereby it receives anything of value in connection with the sale of such products by any marketer. It also prohibits Goodyear from continuing or effecting any contract with Atlantic, \"or with any other marketing oil company,\" whereby Goodyear pays anything of value to the oil company in connection with the sale of tires, batteries and accessories by Goodyear to wholesalers or retailers of the oil company.\n\n1. We first consider Atlantic, whose major argument is that the order is arbitrary and goes too far. It disallows the sales-commission plan, Atlantic says, but permits reinstitution of the old purchase-resale plan even though the latter has the same anticompetitive effects and is a less effective method of distribution. This position flows from the language of the order which prohibits Atlantic's receipt of anything of value in connection with the sale of tires, batteries and accessories by any marketer \"other than The Atlantic Refining Company.\" The merits of the purchase-resale plan, however, were not before the Commission and we therefore have no occasion to pass upon them. Nor do we believe that the order is too broad. Section 5 (b) empowers the Commission to issue a cease-and-desist order against anyone using an unfair method of competition in commerce. The Commission was of the opinion that to enjoin the use of overt coercive tactics was insufficient. We think it was justified in this conclusion. The long existence of the plan itself, coupled with the coercive acts practiced by Atlantic pursuant to it, warranted a decision to require more. The Commission could have decided that to uproot the practice required its complete prohibition; otherwise dealers would \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 373]\n\u00a0\n not enjoy complete freedom from unfair practices which the Act condemns. These are matters well within the ambit of the Commission's authority.\n\n2. As for Goodyear we hold that the order is entirely within the power of the Commission. Both the Commission and the Court of Appeals stressed that the sales-commission plan enabled Goodyear \"to integrate [into] its own nationwide distribution system the economic power possessed by Atlantic over its wholesale and retail petroleum outlets.\" 58 F. T. C., at 348. In addition, the Commission dedicated a considerable portion of its opinion to Goodyear's role in carrying it out. Thus, although it is the oil company's power and overt acts toward its outlets that outlaw the commission plan, the Commission was not restricted solely to an examination of its activity. Rather, in deciding upon the relief to be entered against Goodyear, it could appropriately consider its propensity for harnessing and utilizing that power. Because of the relevance of that evidence to our present inquiry we will consider it here in some detail.\n\nGoodyear was no silent or inactive partner in the implementation of the sales-commission plan. It did not simply sit back and passively accept whatever benefits might accrue to it from the Atlantic contract. Indeed, the most striking aspect of the program, in the Commission's view, was the degree to which the petitioners worked together to achieve the program's success. A Goodyear representative put it very neatly when he said: \"After years of courtship Atlantic and Goodyear have wed. . . . We welcome wholeheartedly this merger.\"\n\nExamples of this close cooperation were numerous. Atlantic had a rather large turnover in dealerships, as well as a substantial number of new station openings each year. With the selection of persons to man these stations, Goodyear supply points were notified by Atlantic before they actually began operations, thus allowing \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 374]\n\u00a0\n Atlantic-Goodyear teams an opportunity to call on the prospective dealer, to get initial orders before local competitors and to condition acceptance of the Goodyear line. Goodyear brands were used for demonstration in Atlantic training schools for these new dealers, and discussions of tires, batteries and accessories at these schools were often conducted by representatives of both Atlantic and Goodyear.\n\nMoreover, Atlantic gave Goodyear lists of its dealers so that the latter could remove advertising for other products and replace it with its own. Goodyear sent lists of dealers refusing to accept its advertising to Atlantic for \"appropriate action\"; and it will be recalled that on one occasion when a list of 46 such dealers was forwarded to Atlantic, all soon fell into line. This is a particularly impressive example of Goodyear's inclination to use Atlantic's power for its own benefit. And there are more.\n\nThe reporting technique used by petitioners was especially revealing. Through it, Atlantic could determine the exact amount of sponsored products purchased by each Atlantic retail outlet from its assigned supply point. Goodyear supplied this information sua sponte insofar as the record shows. Ostensibly it was used in determining commissions due Atlantic. What makes it suspect is the detail with which it was compiled - wholly unnecessary for commission-payment purposes. Its potential use for channeling pressures upon recalcitrant dealers is obvious. And when considered alongside the admitted overt coercive practices of Atlantic, this list becomes a potent device in ensuring the success of the program.\n\nThe Commission also found that Goodyear and Atlantic concluded that the most effective merchandising tactic was dual solicitation or so-called \"double-teaming.\" Goodyear relied heavily on this technique and had urged it on the oil companies in a 1951 letter from its sales-commission program manager. The Commission found \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 375]\n\u00a0\n that \"Goodyear thus appeared confident that the presence of an Atlantic salesman together with the Goodyear representative would render unnecessary any higgling or haggling over price before obtaining an initial order for TBA from Atlantic dealers.\" 58 F. T. C., at 355. (Emphasis in original.) Goodyear's confidence was justified, for as the Commission observed, the annual dealer evaluation by Atlantic salesmen carried substantial weight when the district managers decided upon annual lease extensions, and dealers were therefore understandably susceptible to the encouragement of Goodyear salesmen when Atlantic men were nearby looking over their shoulders. Thus, the Commission was well justified in concluding that Goodyear had in effect purchased a \"captive market.\"\n\nWith the preceding discussion in mind, we turn to Goodyear's relationships with other oil companies. As of December 1964 it had sales-commission agreements with 20 other oil companies. Nine of these contracts were before the Commission in the instant case and were found to be \"in all material respects identical with the Goodyear-Atlantic contract.\" Id., at 352. They similarly require the companies to assist actively in the \"selling and promotion\" of Goodyear products. There is specific evidence in the record of the short-term lease agreements used by Shell, Sinclair and Sherwood Bros., three of the companies with which Goodyear has such agreements. Moreover, there was some indication that only three oil companies use three-year leases. Furthermore there was evidence of practices by at least four oil companies and Goodyear similar to those existing under the Atlantic arrangement. These included threats as well as more subtle pressures.\n\nGoodyear complains that there is no evidence of the economic power of many of the companies with which it has sales-commission plans. However, the Commission's \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 376]\n\u00a0\n order does not directly restrict the activities of these companies. Goodyear, on the other hand, was before the Commission and was found to be a transgressor. There was substantial evidence of its propensity to use the power structure of Atlantic and at least four other oil companies to further its own distribution program. Nor is it any objection for Goodyear to claim that it did not exert any overt coercive pressures on the oil companies' outlets. It is of little consequence that Atlantic actually applied the pressure. For so close was the teamwork of the two companies that, even with blinders on, Goodyear could not have been ignorant of those practices. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that there would have been little point in paying substantial commissions to oil companies were it not for their ability to exert power over their wholesalers and dealers - an ability adequately demonstrated on this record. Its allowance of these substantial overriding commissions in fact paid off handsomely. Goodyear's sales under its various sales-commission contracts rose from $16,700,000 in 1951 to $36,000,000 in 1955.\n\nThe Commission, of course, has \"wide discretion in its choice of a remedy deemed adequate to cope with . . . unlawful practices . . . .\" Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 611\n (1946). Furthermore, it acts within the limits of its authority when it bars repetitions of similar conduct with other parties. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Henry Broch & Co., \n368 \nU.S. 360, 364\n (1962). There was ample evidence establishing on Goodyear's part a course of conduct lasting over 14 years aimed at utilizing oil company power structures to curtail competition in tires, batteries and accessories. We think that the Commission could appropriately conclude that this course of conduct required forbidding the use of sales-commission plans by Goodyear completely.\n\nThis order does not necessarily prohibit Goodyear from making contracts with companies not possessed of economic \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 377]\n\u00a0\n power over their dealers. The evidence in this particular record, however, does involve relationships such as it has enjoyed with Atlantic and its propensity to use those relationships for an unfair competitive advantage. Goodyear offered no evidence that it has arrangements differing from those mentioned in the instant case. In these circumstances it is sufficient to point out that in the event it has such a contract with such a company it may seek a reopening of the order approved today. The Commission has statutory power to reopen and modify its orders at all times. But Congress has placed in the Commission in the first instance the power to shape the remedy necessary to deal with unfair methods of competition. We will interfere only where there is no reasonable relation between the remedy and the violation. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 473\n (1952). On this record we cannot say that the Commission's remedy is unreasonable and the judgments are therefore\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"(a) (1) Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair . . . acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(6) The Commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations . . . from using unfair methods of competition in commerce and unfair . . . acts or practices in commerce.\n\n\n\"(b) Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair . . . act or practice in commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. . . .

It had total operating revenues exceeding $500,000,000 in 1954.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Lessee dealers lease their stations from Atlantic, while contract dealers either own their own stations or lease them from some party other than Atlantic.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Prior to 1951 Atlantic distributed tires, batteries and accessories to its dealers through a purchase-resale plan, whereby it would purchase Lee tires, Exide batteries and various accessories directly from the manufacturers and resell them to its dealers and wholesalers.\n\nAtlantic also entered into a sales-commission agreement with the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company in 1951. Firestone products were to be marketed in the Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania and Southern regions of Atlantic's sales territory, but Firestone is not a party to this action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] While Atlantic controlled the placement of advertising in the dealers' stations, Goodyear furnished and erected the displays. Atlantic permitted no signs or displays other than those of sponsored products.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThat part of the Commission's order enjoining the petitioners from engaging in \"coercive conduct\" designed to compel Atlantic dealers to handle Atlantic-sponsored tires, batteries, and accessories is clearly correct. There is ample evidence that Atlantic coerced its dealers into the exclusive handling of the sponsored goods by threatening the cancellation of dealer franchises. Not only was there direct evidence of the making of such threats; the nearly universal shift to Goodyear's products, coming shortly after the dealers expressed their preference for competing brands, would itself indicate that the change was wrought by something more than simple persuasion. On the basis of this evidence, the Commission reasonably concluded that Atlantic had imposed on its dealers an arrangement \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 378]\n\u00a0\n whereby continued maintenance of their relationship with Atlantic depended upon their handling the sponsored products, despite the absence of contractual terms to this effect and Atlantic's protests that its \"official\" policy was one of free choice.\n\nBut granting that the Commission validly found that the petitioners had engaged in coercive practices amounting to a violation of 5 of the Act does not lead me to conclude that its order enjoining the use of any sales-commission plan of distribution is supportable. In essence, the sales-commission agreement between Atlantic and Goodyear provided Atlantic with a commission on all sales made by Goodyear to the Atlantic dealers in exchange for Atlantic's sponsorship of the Goodyear products. The responsibility for making the sales and deliveries was Goodyear's, though Atlantic undertook to engage in various activities in support of the Goodyear sales effort. This method of distribution was adopted by Atlantic to replace a purchase-resale plan which it had previously employed and found unsatisfactory. Under the purchase-resale plan, Atlantic purchased the tires, batteries, and accessories, warehoused them, and sold them to its dealers. The principal advantage accruing to Atlantic from adoption of the sales-commission plan was that it enabled Atlantic to dispense with maintaining its own storage and distribution facilities. Under both systems, Atlantic had a financial interest in the sale of the sponsored products and, for all that appears, the same incentive to maximize its dealers' purchases of them.\n\nThere is no reason to assume that the sales-commission plan of distribution gave to Atlantic any distinctive capacity to effect the arrangement which is the gravamen of the violation proved. The core of that violation is Atlantic's coercion of its dealers into handling only sponsored products by threatening to cancel their franchises and indulging in a variety of related coercive practices, thereby \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 379]\n\u00a0\n raising substantial barriers to competition in that segment of the market for tires, batteries, and accessories represented by its dealers. This it could have done as easily under the sales-commission plan, the purchase-resale plan, or any plan of distribution which gave it a financial interest in the sale of any particular line of tires, batteries, and accessories.\n\nIndeed the Commission itself recognized that whatever power Atlantic may have over its dealers does not derive from this particular means of distribution:\n\n\"Atlantic has sufficient economic power with respect to its wholesale and retail petroleum distributors to cause them to purchase substantial quantities of sponsored TBA even without the use of overt coercive tactics or of written or oral tying agreements, and this power is a fact existing independently of the particular method of distributing or sponsoring TBA used by Atlantic.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n Therefore, to the extent that the Commission's order is based on the premise that the sales-commission plan confers upon Atlantic some distinctive capacity to coerce its dealers into handling sponsored products, and thereby exclude competing suppliers, it is without foundation. Insofar as this exclusion resulted from threats of franchise cancellation and related coercive tactics, that part of the order directed at these practices will afford the necessary relief.\n\nThe Commission's order need not be justified on a showing that the plan confers any distinctive capacity for coercion upon Atlantic, however, if it can be demonstrated that the plan is merely one variant of a broader category of activity which could be prohibited under 5. It would be less than candid to deny that aggressive salesmanship by Atlantic representatives is apt to meet with more than \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 380]\n\u00a0\n ordinary success when directed at Atlantic dealers, even though the most scrupulous obedience is accorded to the Commission's order prohibiting coercion. Given the disparity of financial resources and the natural desire of the dealers to maintain a cordial relationship with Atlantic, some competitive advantage will necessarily accrue to Atlantic's sponsorship of a particular line of tires, batteries, and accessories under any plan of distribution. This advantage is the inevitable result of the market structure in which Atlantic and its dealers find themselves, and has nothing to do with the particular method which Atlantic might use to market a line of products. The disparity in size and financial strength, the short term of the prevailing leases, the dire financial consequences attendant upon lease cancellation, and the established market preference for certain brands of gasoline - all contribute to give Atlantic a leverage over its dealers and a corresponding power to effect some exclusion of competition.\n\nThe Commission's order can thus be understood as a measure to prevent such exclusion by taking a step toward the total exclusion of Atlantic from the marketing of tires, batteries, and accessories. Indeed, once it is conceded that the sales-commission plan makes no distinctive contribution to Atlantic's coercive capacity, this would seem the only conceivable justification for the Commission's order. This justification, however, is without foundation in law, for it assumes that 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which proscribes unfair methods of competition, prohibits the marketing of complementary goods by a manufacturer or processor enjoying some undefined measure of economic leverage vis-a-vis his distributors. So long as the manufacturer does enjoy some such leverage, his marketing of complementary goods through an established system of distributorships will tend to effect some exclusion of competition, whether those goods be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 381]\n\u00a0\n distributed by another through a sales-commission plan, or purchased and resold by the manufacturer, or indeed manufactured and sold by him.\n\nI cannot believe that 5 was intended to allow the Commission to block the expansion of an enterprise into the marketing of such complementary items. Section 5 prohibits unfair methods of competition. The coercive practices enjoined by paragraphs five and six of the order apart, no unfairness is claimed in any of the practices employed by Atlantic. All concede that the continuing exclusionary pressure, to the extent it exists, derives from the imbalance of economic power between the two parties, rather than from any unfair feature of the sales-commission plan. To use an unfair practice charge to punish an enterprise for consequences inevitably flowing from its position in the structure of commerce is a grave distortion of the statute, imposing a massive and unjustifiable restraint on entrepreneurial action. Henceforth, large concerns marketing their products through smaller distributors stand vulnerable to the charge that their methods of competition are unfair because they have done no more than add a complementary product to those already sold through their distributors. I can find no warrant for this position in the words of the statute, in the economic policy it reflects, or in any of the cases decided under it.\n\nIn short, there is no justification whatever for that part of the Commission's order which prohibits the petitioners from employing the sales-commission plan of distribution. An order based on the premise that the Commission could enjoin Atlantic from any marketing at all of tires, batteries, and accessories is without foundation in the statute; an order based on the premise that the plan confers on Atlantic some distinctive capacity for coercion is without foundation in fact. Baseless in fact and in law, this order inflicts significant and undeserved damage upon Atlantic. Unjustifiable Commission orders imposing such \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 382]\n\u00a0\n damage on corporate enterprise, and ultimately on the public, cannot be sanctioned by invocation of abstractions regarding the deference properly owed expert tribunals in devising remedial measures. It is to avoid just such errors as inhere in this order that the power of judicial review was granted to the courts - errors which, serving no public purpose, impose senseless damage on the private sector of our economy.\n\nFor these reasons I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals approving the Commission's prohibition of the use of the sales-commission plan by Atlantic. I think the Commission's order as to Goodyear should likewise have been set aside by the Court of Appeals. That order is not only riven with the same defects, but in addition prohibits Goodyear from entering into sales-commission agreements with oil companies which, so far as we know, have never practiced the coercive techniques used by Atlantic, and which are not in a position to exercise any leverage at all over their dealers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 58 F. T. C. 309, at 364-365.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nI would vacate the judgments below and remand these cases to the Commission, since in my view the Commission has not set forth the basis for its broad orders with sufficient clarity and completeness, so that they can be properly reviewed. Cf. United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 511\n; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n; Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 156\n; Labor Board v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 438\n.\n\nAtlantic does not here dispute the fact that it engaged in practices to coerce its dealers into purchasing the sales-commission-sponsored TBA. Moreover, I agree with the Court that the record is sufficient to support the finding that Goodyear participated in these coercive practices. Ante. at 373-375. Therefore, I would have no difficulty \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 383]\n\u00a0\n in affirming the Commission's orders if the Commission had ordered Atlantic and Goodyear to cease using sales-commission TBA plans as a remedy necessary to cure these coercive practices and prevent their recurrence. See United States v. Loew's, Inc., \n371 \nU.S. 38, 53\n.\n\nThe Commission's opinion however, does not appear to rest these orders on such a basis. Rather, it considered Atlantic's coercive activities \"as mere symptoms of a more fundamental restraint of trade inherent in the sales commission itself.\" 58 F. T. C. 309, 348. (Emphasis added.) Apparently it was because the Commission believed that Atlantic's participation in a sales-commission plan inherently restricted its dealers' free choice in TBA purchasing that it enjoined Atlantic and Goodyear from entering into any sales-commission plans, with each other or others. It is on this basis that the Commission action must be reviewed. The propriety of agency action must be judged \"solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.\" Securities Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 196\n. See Labor Board v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., supra; Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, supra, at 168.\n\nWhen looked at on this basis, however, it becomes obvious that the Commission has not supported its decision with adequate findings and conclusions, set forth with sufficient clarity, so that proper review is possible. This is seen when the Commission's opinion is analyzed and read in conjunction with its orders, particularly its order enjoining Goodyear from participating in sales-commission arrangements with any oil company.\n\nApparently the Commission's conclusion that the Atlantic-Goodyear sales-commission plan operates as an inherently unfair method of competition was based upon a determination that the Atlantic dealers were in an economically subservient position to Atlantic. This determination in turn was founded upon the facts that the Atlantic lease-franchise arrangements were only for short one-year terms \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 384]\n\u00a0\n enabling Atlantic to terminate them without cause at the end of any year and that it was the practice of many of the dealers to borrow money from Atlantic in order to stock their inventories. This subservient position of the dealers was held to put them in a position where \"Atlantic has sufficient economic power with respect to its wholesale and retail petroleum distributors to cause them to purchase substantial quantities of sponsored TBA even without the use of overt coercive tactics or of written or oral tying agreements, and this power is a fact existing independently of the particular method of distributing or sponsoring TBA used by Atlantic.\" 58 F. T. C., at 364-365.\n\nThough apparently deciding this case on the basis of Atlantic's economic power over its dealers, the Commission then enjoined Goodyear from continuing existing sales-commission arrangements or entering into new ones with any oil company. This was done without any analysis of the relationship which other oil companies may have with their dealers. The Commission determined only the following with respect to other oil companies: (1) the sales-commission contracts between Goodyear and the other oil companies are in all material respects identical to the Goodyear-Atlantic sales-commission contract and (2) one of the other 20 oil companies with which Goodyear has these sales-commission contracts has, in the past, practiced coercion on its dealers. 58 F. T. C., at 352-353. Moreover, in a related case, the Commission expressly held illegal a TBA sales-commission arrangement between Texaco Inc. and the B. F. Goodrich Company without analysis of the relationship between Texaco and its dealers. See Texaco, Inc. v. FTC, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 366, 336 F.2d 754 (C. A. D.C. Cir.). This case and another related case, The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, 58 F. T. C. 371, resulted in both B. F. Goodrich and Firestone, as well as Goodyear, being enjoined from \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 385]\n\u00a0\n engaging in any sales-commission plan with any oil company.\n\nMoreover, the Commission in this case relied upon the facts \"that Atlantic, which describes itself as `. . . a large producer and distributor of petroleum products' whose operating revenue `totalled more than one half billion dollars' in 1954, distributes gasoline directly to more than 5,500 retail service stations and through wholesale distributors to more than 2,800 additional service stations in 17 states along the Atlantic Seaboard. Approximately 81 percent of Atlantic's total sales of gasoline in 1955 were accounted for by these approximately 8,300 retail service stations.\" 58 F. T. C., at 364. These facts were stated to show that Atlantic's position in the petroleum retail market was sufficiently great so as to make its dealerships desirable and unique and that, therefore, Atlantic had power over its dealers sufficient to induce them to buy Atlantic-sponsored TBA. Yet, while relying on these facts about Atlantic, the Commission made no distinction between large or small companies in its order that precluded Goodyear from participating in any sales-commission plan. And, as discussed above, in related cases, B. F. Goodrich and Firestone as well have been enjoined from participating in any TBA sales-commission plan, regardless of the size of the oil company or its relation to its dealers.\n\nAn amicus brief filed on behalf of a small oil company asserts, however, that small oil companies need sales-commission TBA plans in order to compete effectively with the large companies. Since the Commission had only large companies before it in these cases, however, this contention has not adequately been explored. Despite this fact, the Commission has clearly precluded Goodyear, Firestone and B. F. Goodrich from entering into sales-commission arrangements with any oil company no matter how small the company and no matter what the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 386]\n\u00a0\n competitive factors involved are. Moreover, the Commission's opinion here, while again not unambiguous on the point, indicates that it would be per se an unfair method of competition for any tire company to enter into a sales-commission TBA promotion arrangement with any oil company. Yet the whole basis for such a holding rests upon the limited economic facts of the Atlantic situation. This is not to say that the Commission could not conclude, after adequate factual determinations, that a general rule applicable to all companies is correct. It is to say that the Commission must have before it a sufficient record and must make the necessary findings supportive of a rule of broad application before a reviewing court can adequately perform its function.\n\nFinally, the opinion and order of the Commission seem to draw a distinction between sales-commission and purchase-resale methods of oil company TBA promotion. These are alternative methods by which oil companies sponsor TBA purchasing by their dealers. In fact, prior to 1951, Atlantic distributed TBA through a purchase-resale plan. Atlantic-sponsored TBA was purchased by Atlantic from various manufacturers and distributed to the Atlantic dealers through warehouses owned by Atlantic. In some areas the warehouses were supplemented by Atlantic dealers who acted as supply point subdistributors to other dealers. In March 1951, Atlantic changed from the purchase-resale method to the sales-commission plan for the announced reason that the latter arrangement would produce a substantial saving in operating and capital costs, plus a substantial improvement in service to Atlantic dealers. Under the sales-commission plan, the tire company - rather than the oil company - performs the distribution function. The sponsored TBA is manufactured or purchased by the tire company and is distributed through warehouses owned by the tire company. Also, the tire company uses as supply points its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 387]\n\u00a0\n own outlets (both company-owned and independent) as well as some oil company dealers, who are franchised by the tire company for this purpose. Under both purchase-resale and sales-commission plans, the oil company is primarily responsible for selling the TBA to its dealers and assisting them in selling it to their motorist customers. Under both plans the tire company salesman occasionally accompanies the oil company salesman to explain new TBA products, but the day-to-day promoting and selling are done by the oil company salesman.\n\nIn its order the Commission enjoined Atlantic from using any sales-commission TBA plan, but expressly excepted from the injunction the use of Atlantic of a purchase-resale TBA arrangement. This exception was made over the objection of the Commission staff that both methods of TBA sponsorship should be condemned and enjoined. In answer to the argument that it is irrational to condemn sales-commission systems but not purchase-resale plans, the Commission did not even attempt to distinguish the two based on any difference concerning what it considered to be the essential core of the violation by Atlantic, \"the use [by the oil company] of economic power in one market (here, gasoline distribution) to destroy competition in another market (TBA distribution).\" 58 F. T. C., at 367. Indeed, it would seem difficult to draw any distinction between the two plans on this basis. While the Commission did attempt to distinguish the two systems on other bases, this crucial aspect of the decision was handled in a short, summary fashion, without factual findings or analysis. Moreover, the Commission did not even discuss the argument that any distinction which permits purchase-resale but prohibits sales-commission plans discriminates against the smaller oil companies in favor of larger companies. It has been argued earnestly by an amicus that the capital investment required for a purchase-resale plan is so great that the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 388]\n\u00a0\n smaller oil companies cannot afford it and presently only the very large Gulf and Esso companies use such a method. The record in this case is clear that Atlantic switched from purchase-resale to sales-commission TBA promotion since it found the capital costs of purchase-resale to be unduly onerous.\n\nIn his brief in this Court the Solicitor General, on behalf of the Commission, did not even argue that there was a rational distinction between purchase-resale and sales-commission TBA plans. Rather he argued that the Commission had not really approved the purchase-resale plan in failing to enjoin Atlantic's use of it. This argument fails to account for the language of the Commission opinion and the fact that the Commission rejected the staff recommendation, both of which to me are quite persuasive for the conclusion that the Commission has approved purchase-resale. Moreover, it ignores the fact that in the related Firestone case the Commission distinguished its earlier decision in General Motors Corp., 34 F. T. C. 58, which, while condemning and enjoining coercion, did not condemn General Motors' plan of inducing its dealers to buy General Motors automotive parts and accessories. A major ground used by the Commission in distinguishing the General Motors case from the TBA cases, was that the General Motors case involved a purchase-resale plan whereas the TBA cases before the Commission involve sales-commission arrangements. While it would therefore seem to me on the current state of the record that the Commission has approved purchase-resale TBA promotion by oil companies while condemning similar sales-commission promotions, at the very least, this is yet another ambiguity in the opinion.\n\nIn short, the Commission opinions in this and the related cases are bathed in confusion and leave unanswered a number of questions necessarily involved in the decision of these cases. Are TBA sales-commission plans only unfair \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 389]\n\u00a0\n methods of competition if the oil company has used coercive tactics on its dealers? If they are illegal without past or present evidence of coercion, are they illegal for oil companies which do not have the same relation with their dealers as Atlantic has with its dealers? Are they illegal for oil companies which do not have the same market position as Atlantic? Has the Commission drawn a distinction between sales-commission and purchase-resale TBA promotion plans, condemning the former but approving the latter? If it has, is there a rational basis, consistent with the policies of 5, for such a distinction? All of these questions appear to me to be inadequately answered by the Commission's opinion.\n\nI do not mean to imply what the answers to any of these questions should be. Congress has entrusted the initial and primary responsibility for answering them to the Commission. However, as this Court has recognized, \"We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\" United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., supra, at 511. \"The administrative process will best be vindicated by clarity in its exercise.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, supra, at 197. When the Commission \"exercises the discretion given to it by Congress, it must `disclose the basis of its order' and `give clear indication that it has [properly] exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.'\" Labor Board v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., supra, at 443. See Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, supra, at 167-169. Administrative agency action is not to be sustained where \"its explication is . . . inadequate, irrational or arbitrary . . . .\" Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221, 236\n.\n\nMoreover, if in these and the related cases the Commission is laying down the broad rule that all sales-commission TBA promotion arrangements in the oil industry are per se unfair methods of competition, such a rule has \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 390]\n\u00a0\n neither been clearly articulated nor supported with adequate economic analysis. In White Motor Co. v. United States, \n372 \nU.S. 253\n, this Court reversed a district court that had developed a per se rule of antitrust liability without regard to an analysis of the economics of the situation. The Court stated, \"This is the first case involving a territorial restriction in a vertical arrangement; and we know too little of the actual impact of both that restriction and the one respecting customers to reach a conclusion on the bare bones of the documentary evidence before us.\" \n372 \nU.S., at 261\n.\n\nSimilarly in this case, the Commission has not provided us with a factual record or analysis sufficient to reach the conclusion that sales-commission plans are per se illegal in the oil industry. In condemning such arrangements the Commission would be upsetting long-established practices prevalent in the oil industry. It would be affecting the entire oil industry, small companies as well as large, not just the particular parties involved in these cases. Finally, it must be remembered that the Commission is an expert administrative body set up by Congress in order to provide adequate economic fact finding and analyses of complicated problems such as the ones here presented. The integrity of this congressional scheme is violated by the Commission's entering and the courts' affirming broad industry-wide orders the meaning and bases of which are unclear and the factual and economic analysis of which is inadequate.\n\nI do not mean by this that the Commission is required to use a rule-making rather than a case-by-case approach to decision-making in this area, although it would seem that rule-making would here be the preferable approach. Cf. Elman, Comment, Rulemaking Procedures in the FTC's Enforcement of the Merger Law, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 385 (1964). The Commission has the general power to choose to proceed in this field, as in others, through \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 391]\n\u00a0\n either rule-making or the process of case-by-case adjudication. See Securities Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., supra, at 201-202; California v. Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., \n379 \nU.S. 366, 371\n. Whichever method the Commission chooses to use, however, it seems obvious to me that the Commission must formulate a clear rational rule which is based on an adequate economic explication and takes into consideration the situation of all industry members affected by the rule. Since its failure to do so precludes proper judicial review of these cases, I would vacate the judgments below and remand these cases to the Commission so that it can, with clarity, exercise the administrative process entrusted to the Commission by Congress. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 357, 392]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAUTO WORKERS v.

Zeman and Benjamin Rubenstein.\n\nSolicitor General Marshall argued the cause for respondents in both cases. With him on the brief for the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n National Labor Relations Board were Ralph S. Spritzer, Arnold Ordman, Dominick L. Manoli and Norton J. Come.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe two cases before us present converse sides of a single question - whether parties who are wholly successful in unfair labor practice proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board have a right to intervene in the Court of Appeals review proceedings.\n\nIn No. 18 (Scofield), the Union Local was charged by four individual employees with violations of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, 73 Stat. 519, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq. (1964 ed.), for fining certain Union members for exceeding incentive pay ceilings set by the Union. The General Counsel of the Board issued a complaint. After a full hearing, the Board dismissed the complaint, 145 N. L. R. B. 1097. The individual employees then sought review in the Seventh Circuit. The General Counsel filed an answer supporting the decision. At this point, the Union filed a timely motion of intervention, alleging that it would be directly affected should the appellate court set aside the Board's decision and direct the entry of a remedial order against it. Neither the individual employees nor the Board opposed intervention. A division of the Seventh Circuit denied the motion to intervene, but authorized the Union to file a brief as amicus curiae without leave to participate in oral argument. The Union sought review here, and we granted certiorari to review the denial of intervention because of the importance of the issue and the conflict among the courts of appeals, \n379 \nU.S. 959\n. Further proceedings were stayed pending the completion of our review.\n\nIn No. 53 (Fafnir), the Local filed unfair labor practice charges against the Fafnir Bearing Company. The \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n charging party alleged that the company had violated its statutory bargaining obligation by refusing to permit the contracting Union to conduct its own time studies of job operations in the plant. The Union allegedly needed to conduct these studies to ascertain whether it should proceed to arbitration. The General Counsel issued a complaint, a hearing was held, and the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against the company, 146 N. L. R. B. 1582. The company petitioned for review in the Second Circuit, and the Board filed a cross-petition for enforcement. The Union - the successful party before the Board - moved to intervene, alleging numerous grounds in support. Both the company and the Board opposed intervention. The Second Circuit denied the motion, although cognizant of the difficulties of the problem, and authorized the Union to file an amicus brief. 339 F.2d 801. We granted certiorari, \n380 \nU.S. 950\n, and consolidated Fafnir with Scofield in order to consider both facets of the intervention problem.\n\nWe hold that both the successful charged party (in Scofield) and the successful charging party (in Fafnir) have a right to intervene in the Court of Appeals proceeding which reviews or enforces Labor Board orders. We think that Congress intended to confer intervention rights upon the successful party to the Labor Board proceedings in the court in which the unsuccessful party challenges the Board's decision.\n\nA threshold question concerns our jurisdiction to grant certiorari. Under 1254 (1) of the Judicial Code,\n1\n only \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 209]\n\u00a0\n a \"party\" to a case in the Court of Appeals may seek review here. In both these cases, the Union seeking certiorari was denied intervention and relegated to the status of an amicus curiae. Because an amicus is not a \"party\" to the case, it would not have been entitled to file a petition to review a judgment on the merits by the Court of Appeals, Ex parte Leaf Tobacco Board, \n222 \nU.S. 578, 581\n; Ex parte Cutting, \n94 \nU.S. 14, 20\n-22. In view of our decision herein, we think that 1254 (1) permits us to review the orders denying intervention. See Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., \n331 \nU.S. 519\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nCongress has made a careful adjustment of the individual and administrative interests throughout the course of litigation over a labor dispute. The Labor Act does not, however, provide explicitly for intervention at the appellate court level. Section 10 (f) of the Act, 61 Stat. 148, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 160 (f) (1964 ed.), serves as our guide, even though it is silent on the intervention problem. It states, in pertinent part:\n\n \"Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any United States court of appeals in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such a court a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside.\"\n\n\n Similarly, no specific standards govern the propriety of intervention in Labor Board review proceedings. The Rules of the Courts of Appeals typically provide: \"A person desiring to intervene in a case where the applicable \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n statute does not provide for intervention shall file with the court and serve upon all parties a motion for leave to intervene.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nLacking a clear directive on the subject, we look to the statutory design of the Act. Cf. Scripps-Howard Radio v. Commission, \n316 \nU.S. 4, 11\n. Of course, in considering the propriety of intervention in the courts of appeals, our discussion is limited to Labor Board review proceedings. Federal agencies are not fungibles for intervention purposes - Congress has treated the matter with attention to the particular statutory scheme and agency.\n\nIn some instances, the words of the statute themselves elicit an answer. When the Board enters a final order against the charged party, it is clear that the phrase \"[a]ny person aggrieved\" in 10 (f) enables him to seek immediate review in the appropriate Court of Appeals. Alternatively, if the Board determines that a complaint should be dismissed, the charging party has a statutory right to review as a \"person aggrieved.\" A hybrid situation occurs when the Board dismisses certain portions of the complaint and issues an order on others. As to that portion which results in a remedial order against him, the charged party is aggrieved; likewise, the charging party is aggrieved with respect to the portion of the decision dismissing the complaint. Each one is a \"party\" in a consolidated appeal, and has invariably been granted leave to intervene with regard to the portion of the order on which the Board found in his favor.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\nScofield serves as an example of another variant in review proceedings. The unsuccessful charging party to the Board proceedings petitioned for review, and the successful charged party wished to intervene. The vast majority of the courts have recognized his right to do so.\n4\n Recognition of intervention rights in this instance is in complete accord with the statements in Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364, 369\n, 373, that:\n\n \"While 10 (f) assures to any aggrieved person opportunity to contest the Board's order, it does not require an unnecessary duplication of proceedings. The aim of the Act is to attain simplicity and directness both in the administrative procedure and on judicial review. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . The jurisdiction to review the orders of the Labor Relations Board is vested in a court with equity powers, and while the court must act within the bounds of the statute and without intruding upon the administrative province, it may adjust its \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action. The purpose of the judicial review is consonant with that of the administrative proceeding itself, - to secure a just result with a minimum of technical requirements. . . .\"\n\n\n To allow intervention to the charged party in the first appellate review proceeding is to avoid \"unnecessary duplication of proceedings,\" and to adhere to the goal of obtaining \"a just result with a minimum of technical requirements.\" Analysis of the Act's machinery in practice so indicates. A decision of the reviewing court to set aside a Board order dismissing a complaint has the effect of returning the case to the Board for further proceedings. This normally results in the Board's entering an order against the charged party. From this remedial order, as noted, the charged party is aggrieved and may seek review. Judicial time and energy is then expended in pursuit of issues already resolved in the first appeal.\n5\n Moreover, the second appeal could lead to undesirable \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n \"circuit shopping\" and useless proliferation of judicial effort. Under 10 (f), an aggrieved person has the option of obtaining review either in the circuit in which he maintains his residence or place of business or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In the second appellate proceeding, he could obtain a hearing in the circuit which did not originally decide the validity of the Board's dismissal of the complaint. Permitting intervention in the first review thus centralizes the controversy and limits it to a single decision, accelerating final resolution. This is in accord with one of the objectives of the Labor Act - the prompt determination of labor disputes.\n\nPermitting intervention also insures fairness to the would-be intervenor. If intervention is permitted, the parties to the Board proceedings are able to present their arguments on the issues to a reviewing court which has not crystallized its views. To be sure, if intervention is denied in the initial review proceeding, the charged party would not be bound by the decision under technical res judicata rules. Still, the salient facts having been resolved and the legal problems answered in this initial review, subsequent litigation serves little practical value to the potential intervenor. In the second appellate proceeding, the Court of Appeals would almost invariably defer to the initial decision as a matter of stare decisis or of comity.\n6\n See, e. g., Siegel Co. v. Labor Board, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n 340 F.2d 309; Zdanok v. Glidden Co., 327 F.2d 944, 949-950, cert. denied, \n377 \nU.S. 934\n.\n\nAllowing intervention does not affect the discretionary review powers of this Court. One occupying the status of intervenor in the Court of Appeals proceeding may seek certiorari from the decision there, Steelworkers v. Labor Board, \n373 \nU.S. 908, 376\n U.S. 492; Mine Workers v. Eagle-Picher Co., \n325 \nU.S. 335, 338\n-339. Denial of intervention in the initial review proceedings - and the attendant remand to the Board and second appeal to the Court of Appeals - only results in a delay of the time when the disaffected party may seek review here. Should we decide to grant certiorari, the first review would seem the more propitious time, since all the parties are then before the Court and the dispute has been fully developed without inconvenience to either private party. Steel-workers v. Labor Board, \n376 \nU.S. 492\n, affords an apt illustration. The Court of Appeals had permitted intervention to the charged party who sought review from the adverse decision there. We reversed unanimously. The Board itself had not sought certiorari because \"the Solicitor General concluded that other cases were entitled to priority in selecting the limited number of cases which the government [could] properly ask this Court to review.\" Memorandum for the NLRB, p. 2, filed in connection with the petition for certiorari, No. 89, October Term, 1963. Had the charged party been denied intervention in the Court of Appeals, the decision of the Government not to apply for certiorari - unrelated to the merits of the cause - would have unnecessarily postponed resolution on that important issue.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn fact, the Labor Board itself agrees that intervention by charged parties will not impair effective discharge of its duties and may well promote the public interest. The rights typically secured to an intervenor in a reviewing court - to participate in designating the record, to participate in prehearing conferences preparatory to simplification of the issues, to file a brief, to engage in oral argument, to petition for rehearing in the appellate court or to this Court for certiorari - are not productive of delay nor do they cause complications in the appellate courts. Appellate records in Labor Board cases are generally complete, and whatever material the charged party may see fit to add to the appendix will not affect the burden in preparation. Participation in defining the issues before the court guarantees that all relevant material is brought to its attention, and makes the briefs on the merits more meaningful. The charged party is usually accorded the right as an amicus to file a brief on the merits even if denied intervention. Participation in oral argument does not necessarily enlarge the total time allocated, since parties aligned on the same side are usually required to share the time.\n8\n And, as noted, petitioning for certiorari at this time has the salutary effect of insuring prompt adjudication. Further, if a charged party permitted to intervene decides to acquiesce in the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 216]\n\u00a0\n decision or if certiorari is denied by this Court, it is likely that he will then stipulate to the entry of an order against him. This would obviate the need for supplemental agency or court proceedings. On the other hand, an amicus - with the exception of the right to file a brief - might be unable adequately to present all the relevant data to the court.\n\nFinally, an element of fortuity would be injected by the denial of intervention to a successful party in the Board proceedings. When the charged party loses before the Board, he is accorded a statutory right to immediate review and may seek or oppose this Court's ultimate review of the case. If he prevails at the agency level, however, denial of intervention deprives him of the rights accorded a losing party, even though the issue before the reviewing court is identical - whether a remedial order should have been entered against the charged party. These considerations lead us to the assumption that Congress would not intend, without clearly expressing a view to the contrary, that a party should suffer by his own success before the agency.\n\nAdditionally, helpful analogies may be found in the Judicial Review Act of 1950, governing intervention in the Courts of Appeals by private parties directly affected by agency orders,\n9\n and in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 217]\n\u00a0\n We take these provisions to mean that Congress has exhibited a concern that interested private parties be given a right to intervene and participate in the review proceedings involving the specified agency and its orders.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe problem of whether intervention should be granted to the successful charging party to the Labor Board proceedings presents considerations somewhat distinct from the case of the intervening charged party. Resolution of the problem is no easy matter, and it is understandable that the courts have divided on the issue.\n11\n Still, we believe that Congress intended intervention rights to obtain.\n\nThe Board opposes intervention in Fafnir. A charged party may incur a liability on account of an order being entered against him. Fairness to him thus requires that \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 218]\n\u00a0\n he be allowed to intervene to preclude that possibility. On the other hand, the Board reasons, the charging party stands only to become a beneficiary of an order entered.\n12\n As such, he is but another member of the public whose interests the Board is designed to serve. The Labor Board is said to be the custodian of the \"public interest,\" to the exclusion of the so-called \"private interests\" at stake. Support for this view is claimed to be found in our decision in Amalgamated Util. Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., \n309 \nU.S. 261\n (1940). Also, the Board fears that enabling the intervenor to petition for certiorari from an adverse circuit decision will be inimical to the public interest. We disagree.\n\nIn prior decisions, this Court has observed that the Labor Act recognizes the existence of private rights within the statutory scheme.\n13\n These cases have, to be sure, emphasized the \"public interest\" factor. To employ the rhetoric of \"public interest,\" however, is not to imply that the public right excludes recognition of parochial private interests. A perusal of the statutory scheme and of the Board's Rules and Regulations is illustrative. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 219]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe statutory machinery begins with the filing of an unfair labor practice charge by a private person, 10 (b), 61 Stat. 146; see also, 24 Fed. Reg. 9102 (1959), 29 CFR 102.9 (1965). When the General Counsel issues a complaint and the proceeding reaches the adjudicative stage, the course the hearing will take is in the agency's control, but the charging party is accorded formal recognition: he participates in the hearings as a \"party\";\n14\n he may call witnesses and cross-examine others, may file exceptions to any order of the trial examiner, and may file a petition for reconsideration to a Board order, 28 Fed. Reg. 7973 (1963), as amended, 29 CFR 102.46 (1965). Of course, if the Board dismisses the complaint, he can obtain review as a person aggrieved, which serves the \"public interest\" by guaranteeing that the Board interpretation of the relevant provisions accords with the intent of Congress.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that the charging party may have vital \"private rights\" in the Board proceeding is clear in this very case, which also involves, potentially, a breach of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.\n16\n Under our decisions in the Steelworkers trilogy, \n363 \nU.S. 564, 574\n, 593, and Carey v. Westinghouse Corp., \n375 \nU.S. 261\n, the Union could take whatever contractual claim it had to arbitration and from there to a federal court. And while it is true that the rights and duties under 301 (a) of the Labor Act, 61 Stat. 156, are not coextensive with those redressed in Labor Board proceedings, a determination by an appellate court that the Union has no statutory right to conduct its own time studies will surely have an impact upon a later decision by an arbitrator or an appellate court under 301 (a) on the contractual issue.\n\nIn short, we think that the statutory pattern of the Labor Act does not dichotomize \"public\" as opposed to \"private\" interests. Rather, the two interblend in the intricate statutory scheme.\n17\n Nor do we think that our holding in Amalgamated Util. Workers, \n309 \nU.S. 261\n, casts doubt on these notions. The Court there held that private parties who initiated unfair labor practice charges may not prosecute a contempt action against the charged \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 221]\n\u00a0\n party in the court which enforces the Labor Board order.\n18\n In the same case, the private parties had been permitted to intervene in the Court of Appeals when the merits of the Board's decision were at stake, \n309 \nU.S., at 263\n. We find nothing inconsistent in denying the right of a private party to institute a contempt proceeding - where the Board's expertness in achieving compliance with orders is challenged - and, on the other hand, in permitting intervention in a proceeding already in the court for decision. When the court is to rule on the merits of the Board's order, the Act supports the view that it is the court and not the agency which will define the public interest, see 10 (d), 49 Stat. 454, Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364\n.\n\nThe Board also argues that permitting intervention will adversely affect its tactical or budgetary decision not to bring a case here for review. But the opportunity is open to the Board to advise this Court whether a case that the intervening charging party brings here is an appropriate vehicle to raise important issues. And Congress \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 222]\n\u00a0\n has entrusted to this Court, rather than the Labor Board, discretionary jurisdiction to review cases decided by the Courts of Appeals.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nMany of the considerations which favor intervention in Scofield are also pertinent here.\n20\n Of special note is the capriciousness we would have to ascribe to Congress in refusing to afford the successful party to a Labor Board proceeding an opportunity tantamount to that of the unsuccessful party in persuading an appellate court. The charging party, like the charged party, should not be prejudiced by his success before the agency. Accordingly, we reverse both cases and remand them to the respective courts for further proceedings.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1254 (1), 28 U.S.C. 1254 (1) (1964 ed.), provides:\n\n\"Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court . . .:\n\n\n\"(1) By writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil . . . case, before or after rendition of judgment or decree.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Second Circuit Rule 13 (f); Seventh Circuit Rule 14 (f).

A. 9th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] There are, of course, cases in which the Court of Appeals will remand to the Board to take additional evidence or to reconsider the order in light of litigational developments. In these cases, there is a greater opportunity for the party originally victorious before the Board successfully to persuade it or the appellate court than in the case in which no additional evidence need be taken. Still, the considerations discussed herein strongly suggest the propriety of intervention in these cases as well, especially since, at the time a motion for leave to intervene is filed, the reviewing court will not be fully apprised of the issues involved in the case.\n\nThen, too, only 12 proceedings in which the Board had entered an order dismissing the complaint and the charging party appealed the dismissal in the Court of Appeals occurred during the 1964 fiscal year. See 29 NLRB Ann. Rep. 201, Table 19 (1964). In eight of these, the Board orders were affirmed in full. Ibid. The small caseload gives further support for the notion that the courts of appeals, and the Board, will not be disadvantaged by allowing intervention to the charged party.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In the rare instance in which the reviewing court does not abide by these principles, an even more aggravated situation could result. In the second review proceeding, if the now-successful charging party is denied intervention and the appellate court takes a different view of the applicable law, the charging party might later have the opportunity to seek review again as a \"person aggrieved.\" Thus, three or even more review proceedings could be engendered out of the failure to permit intervention at the most convenient stage - the initial review proceeding. Such an incongruous result should not be sanctioned in light of our statement in Ford Motor Co. v. Labor \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, that although \"there are two proceedings, separately carried on the docket, they were essentially one so far as any question as to the legality of the Board's order was concerned.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Labor Board may also adversely affect the rights of the private parties in other instances. For example, the Board may \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n decide a case and later re-evaluate its position at a time when that case is before an appellate court. The General Counsel, in such a situation, cannot be expected wholeheartedly to attempt to convince an appellate court of the correctness of a doctrine which the Board itself has abandoned.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] First Circuit Rule 28 (3); Second Circuit Rule 23 (c); Third Circuit Rule 31 (3); Fourth Circuit Rule 15 (3); Fifth Circuit Rule 25 (3); Sixth Circuit Rule 20 (3); Seventh Circuit Rule 21 (b); Eighth Circuit Rule 13 (c); Ninth Circuit Rule 20 (3); Tenth Circuit Rule 20 (3); District of Columbia Circuit Rule 19 (c).\n\nAdditionally, all the circuits have rules which permit the court to increase the time for oral argument upon a showing of good cause.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Review of commission orders in general is governed by the provisions of the Judicial Review Act of 1950 (the Hobbs Act), 64 Stat. 1129, 5 U.S.C. 1031-1042 (1964 ed.). The provision regarding appellate court intervention, 5 U.S.C. 1038, provides as follows:\n\n\"The Attorney General shall be responsible for and have charge and control of the interests of the Government in all court proceedings authorized by this chapter. The agency, and any party or parties in interest in the proceeding before the agency whose interests will be affected if an order of the agency is or is not enjoined, set aside, or suspended, may appear as parties thereto of their own motion and as of right, and be represented by counsel in any proceeding to review such order. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of course, apply only in the federal district courts. Still, the policies underlying intervention may be applicable in appellate courts. Under Rule 24 (a) (2) or Rule 24 (b) (2), we think the charged party would be entitled to intervene. See Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Co. v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 502, 505\n-506; Textile Workers Union of America v. Allendale Co., 96 U.S. App. D.C. 401, 403-404, 226 F.2d 765, 767-768.\n\nThe Advisory Panel on Labor-Management Relations Law issued a report, S. Doc. No. 81, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. (1960), which contained a statement of policy that \"any party to NLRB proceedings should be allowed to intervene in the appellate proceedings,\" p. 17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The cases which have permitted intervention usually have not discussed the question, e. g., Labor Board v.

The agency becomes their champion and they stand or fall by it. Does this phenomenon reflect a disregard or a recognition of the equities of the situation?\"\n\n\n See also Jaffe, The Public Right Dogma in Labor Board Cases, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 720 (1946).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Labor Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240, 258\n; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 194\n; Nathanson v. Labor Board, \n344 \nU.S. 25, 27\n; Smith v. Evening News Assn., \n371 \nU.S. 195\n. See Jaffe, The Individual Right to Initiate Administrative Process, 25 Iowa L. Rev. 485, 528-531 (1940).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The NLRB Rules and Regulations and Statements of Procedure, 29 CFR 102.8 (1965), afford the charging party this status. The section provides as follows:\n\n\"The term `party' as used herein shall mean . . . any person named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party, in any Board proceeding, including, without limitation, any person filing a charge or petition under the act, any person named as respondent, as employer, or as party to a contract in any proceeding under the act . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] For an analysis of the rights of a charging party before the Board, see Comment, 32 U. Chi. L. Rev. 786 (1965). Of course, the considerations involved in determining whether the charging party has certain rights before the Board are not dispositive on the question of appellate intervention. In the first place, the need for centralized control over the agency hearings and the standards under which they operate is much greater at the administrative than the appellate level, where perforce an adequate record has been made for adjudication. Also, the statistics of the NLRB reveal that over 97% of the unfair labor practice charges are resolved before the circuit court has entered a decree. 29 NLRB Ann. Rep. 178-179, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 220]\n\u00a0\n Table 7 (1964). This winnowing process diminishes once a case is lodged in the circuit court and falls within our supervisory power over the federal courts. Then, too, manpower and budgetary considerations are of great concern at the administrative level. These factors are not nearly as great when a labor dispute reaches the appellate courts since the Board will invariably appear to defend its order.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In the Board's opinion in Fafnir, the charging party's interests were referred to a dozen times as a statutory right of the \"private party,\" 146 N. L. R. B., at 1585-1587.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See Retail Clerks Local 137 v. Food Employers Council, Inc., 351 F.2d 525.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Court placed great weight upon the language and legislative history behind 10 (a), 49 Stat. 453, as it read at that time:\n\n\"The Board is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 8) affecting commerce. This power shall be exclusive, and shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The italicized portion of 10 (a) was deleted in the Taft-Hartley amendments to the Wagner Act in 1947, when Congress added the union unfair labor practice provisions and enacted 301 (a). While it is true that the Labor Board does not confer a private administrative remedy, it is equally true that, since 1947, it serves substantially as an organ for adjudicating private disputes. See Report of the Advisory Panel on Labor-Management Relations Law, supra, n. 10, p. 5.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The Board also claims that the charging party, if permitted to intervene, will be able to thwart proposed settlements between the Board and the charged party when the case is in the appellate court. Nothing in the record indicates that this will be the consequence of allowing intervention and we intimate no view on the question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] As in the case of the charged party, disallowing intervention could lead to duplicity in appellate review, \"circuit shopping,\" unfairness to the successful party to the Board proceedings, etc. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 205, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAKER v.

They were convicted of violating a North Carolina statute making it a crime to enter upon the lands of another without a license after being forbidden to do so, and their convictions were affirmed by the State Supreme Court. The restaurant and the adjoining motel which are under the same management are on an interstate highway and are extensively advertised. Held: Since the restaurant serves or offers to serve interstate travelers it is a \"place of public accommodation\" within 201 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and these convictions although for conduct prior to the enactment thereof are abated by passage of that Act.

This restaurant served whites only and carried a sign to that effect on its front door. Pursuant to this policy the owner of the restaurant locked the door against the Negroes, though from time to time he would open the door to admit white customers and relock it after they \n\n[379 \nU.S. 684, 685]\n\u00a0\n had entered. The restaurant was some 60 feet from the highway, the property between the restaurant and the highway being owned by the restaurant proprietor. The Negroes waited outside the door, some on a shrubbery box six or eight feet away, others up to 15 feet distant. The owner asked the Negroes to leave; but they continued to wait quietly outside until they were arrested. For this conduct petitioners were indicted and convicted for violation of 14-134 of the North Carolina General Statutes, making it an offense to \"go or enter upon the lands of another, without a license therefor\" and \"after being forbidden to do so.\" The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed petitioners' convictions on March 18, 1964. 261 N.C. 463, 135 S. E. 2d 14; 261 N.C. 467, 135 S. E. 2d 17.\n\nThe Plantation Restaurant is situated on Interstate Highway 301 in the town of Enfield, North Carolina. Adjoining the restaurant and owned by the same person is the Enfield Motel. The restaurant's menu and other advertising are posted in the rooms of this motel. The Plantation Restaurant and Enfield Motel are advertised on billboards for some miles up and down Highway 301. They are further advertised on the radio and in the newspapers.\n\nSince these facts make it clear that the Plantation Restaurant \"serves or offers to serve interstate travelers,\" it must be held that the restaurant is a \"place of public accommodation\" within the meaning of 201 (b) (2) and (c) (2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n\"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids discrimination in places of public accommodation and removes peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis from the category of punishable activities.

We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in both these cases in this regard, 345 F.2d 310, 319-321; 345 F.2d 325, 328.\n\nPlans for desegregating the public school systems of Hopewell and Richmond, Virginia, were approved by the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia without full inquiry into petitioners' contention that faculty allocation on an alleged racial basis rendered the plans inadequate under the principles of Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n. The Court of Appeals, while recognizing the standing of petitioners, as parents and pupils, to raise this contention, declined to decide its merits because no evidentiary hearings had been held on this issue. But instead of remanding the cases for such hearings prior to final approval of the plans, the Court of Appeals held that \"[w]hether and when such an inquiry is to be had are matters with respect to which the District Court . . . has a large measure of discretion,\" and it reasoned as follows:\n\n\"When direct measures are employed to eliminate all direct discrimination in the assignment of pupils, a District Court may defer inquiry as to the appropriateness of supplemental measures until the effect and the sufficiency of the direct ones may be determined. The possible relation of a reassignment of teachers to protection of the constitutional rights of pupils need not be determined when it is speculative. When all direct discrimination in the assignment of pupils has been eliminated, assignment of teachers may be expected to follow the racial patterns established in the schools. An earlier judicial requirement of general reassignment of all teaching and administrative personnel need not be considered until the possible detrimental effects of such an order upon the administration of the schools and the efficiency of their staffs can be appraised along with the need for such an order in aid of protection of the constitutional rights of pupils.\" 345 F.2d, at 320-321. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We hold that petitioners were entitled to such full evidentiary hearings upon their contention. There is no merit to the suggestion that the relation between faculty allocation on an alleged racial basis and the adequacy of the desegregation plans is entirely speculative. Nor can we perceive any reason for postponing these hearings: Each plan had been in operation for at least one academic year; these suits had been pending for several years; and more than a decade has passed since we directed desegregation of public school facilities \"with all deliberate speed,\" Brown v. Board of Education, \n349 \nU.S. 294, 301\n. Delays in desegregating school systems are no longer tolerable. Goss v. Board of Education, \n373 \nU.S. 683, 689\n; Calhoun v.

City of Memphis, \n373 \nU.S. 526\n.\n\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeals are vacated and the cases are remanded to the District Court for evidentiary hearings consistent with this opinion.

The hearings themselves were concluded in November 1954, more than 10 years ago. On so stale \n\n[380 \nU.S. 513, 514]\n\u00a0\n a record we do not think it is either necessary or appropriate that we decide the serious constitutional questions raised by the order.

JUSTICE BLACK, see ante, p. 511.]\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concur, dissenting.\n\nI think this case is ripe for decision. The controversy is real, not feigned. All of the relevant facts one needs to know to resolve the constitutional question are exposed in the present record.\n\nThis is the famous brigade of Americans who fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco. Approximately 3,000 American youths were members; and of these only about 1,800 survived. Petitioner was formed in 1939 as an unincorporated association and was incorporated in 1940 under the laws of New York, its charter being forfeited in 1952 for failure to file required reports.\n\nThe record is detailed. The Court of Appeals, which sustained the Subversive Activities Control Board in finding that petitioner is a \"Communist-front organization\" within the meaning of 3 (4) of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, as amended, 64 Stat. 989, 50 U.S.C. 782 (4) (117 U.S. App. D.C. 404, 331 F.2d 64), spoke of \"the tremendous volume of the record\" and the \"almost numberless facets of fact involved.\" Id., at 413, 331 F.2d, at 73. The history of the formation of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n Brigade, its relationship with the Communist Party and with Communists, the manner in which international brigades of this kind were employed by Communists, the role of Communists in forming this Brigade, the affiliations of officers of the Brigade, the ideas and program promoted by the Brigade's official organ, Volunteer for Liberty, the efforts of the Brigade to get its members employed in unions, offices, or factories where a Communist unit or functionary was located, the extent to which the Brigade responded to Party discipline, and the extent to which the Brigade aided and supported the Party - all were fully explored.\n\nSince 1950 the Brigade's affairs have been run almost entirely by an Executive Secretary and a National Commander. Since 1950 its activities have consisted principally of social affairs, rehabilitating and resettling veterans and getting them employment, making statements in opposition to the Franco regime, supporting its members who were indicted under the Smith Act, and defending itself in this proceeding.\n\nThis proceeding started in 1953, when the Attorney General petitioned the Board for an order requiring the Brigade to register as a Communist-front organization. Hearings before the Board commenced May 3, 1954, and ended November 16, 1954. Over a year later the Board issued a registration order against the Brigade, and its report in the case. The final order of the Board is dated December 21, 1955. The opinion of the Court of Appeals comes eight years later\n*\n and is dated December 17, 1963.\n\nBut no one suggests that there have been any basic changes in the pattern of the Brigade's activities either \n\n[380 \nU.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n since the Board's order or the Court's judgment. The Court of Appeals found no difficulty in concluding that as of the date of the record the Brigade continued to be what it had been in the past:\n\n\"The events in 1950-1954 were not factually isolated. The Brigade continued to operate after 1950. It had the same officers and occupied the same offices. It continued to publish its magazine. The character and tone of its declarations upon the subjects with which it dealt were the same as those it had always utilized. So that factually, on this record, the post-1950 activities and policies appear as a continued, although diminished, stream, rather than as a separate, new phase of life.\" 117 U.S. App. D.C., at 412-413, 331 F.2d, at 72-73.\n\n\n None of the parties before us has suggested that the record is stale or incomplete; and as noted in my dissenting opinion in American Committee v. Control Board, ante, p. 507, the Act contains a special provision covering that contingency. None of the parties before us has suggested that we need to know more about the Brigade since the Board's decision in 1955. We are told by counsel that what the Brigade once was, it still is.\n\nThere is one way and one way only in which this case is getting stale with the passage of time. And that is that the Brigade's membership is not being renewed but depleted. Its membership, as noted, is made up of Americans who fought in the Spanish War against Franco. The mortality table has caused that list to shrink and it \n\n[380 \nU.S. 513, 517]\n\u00a0\n will continue to shrink. In 1955 there were only 600 survivors of the Brigade, not all of whom were members of petitioner. Hence in some months or years the case will return to us more stale than it is at the present time.\n\nWith all due respect.

NEW YORK CENTRAL R. CO.(1965)\nNo. 437\nArgued: March 11, 1965Decided: April 5, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner brought an action in an Ohio court with jurisdiction against respondent, who was properly served with process, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) only a few days before the expiration of the three-year limitation period provided by the Act. Because under Ohio law venue was improper, the action was dismissed. Eight days later, and after the expiration of the three-year period, petitioner filed the FELA action in the federal court. The District Court dismissed the complaint as untimely and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: Where a timely FELA action is begun in a state court having jurisdiction, the defendant is served with process, and the case is dismissed for improper venue, the FELA time limitation is tolled during the pendency of the state suit and until the state court order dismissing the action becomes final. Pp. 426-436.\n\n 332 F.2d 529, reversed and remanded.\n\nDouglas G. Cole argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Otto F. Putnick.\n\nRoy W. Short argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn March 13, 1963, petitioner, a resident of Kentucky, began an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq. (1958 ed.), in the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County, Ohio. He alleged that he had been injured on March 17, 1960, in Indiana, while in the course of his employment with respondent, the New York Central Railroad. The \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 425]\n\u00a0\n Ohio court had jurisdiction of the action, and respondent was properly served with process. The action was dismissed upon respondent's motion, however, because venue was improper. While in Ohio in most transitory actions venue is proper wherever the defendant can be summoned, see Ohio Rev. Code 2307.36, 2307.38, 2307.39, venue is properly laid in actions against railroads to recover for personal injuries only in the county of the plaintiff's residence or the county where the injury occurred.\n1\n See Ohio Rev. Code 2307.37, Loftus v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 107 Ohio St. 352, 140 N. E. 94. On June 12, 1963, eight days after his state court action was dismissed, petitioner brought an identical action in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The District Court dismissed petitioner's complaint on the ground that although the state suit was brought within the limitations period, the federal action was not timely and was then barred by the limitation provision of the FELA, 35 Stat. 66, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 56 (1958 ed.), which provides: \"That no action shall be maintained under this Act unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued.\" 230 F. Supp. 767. The Court of Appeals, rejecting petitioner's argument that his suit in the state court had tolled the FELA limitation provision, affirmed the District Court's dismissal of his suit. 332 F.2d 529. The Court of Appeals reasoned that since the limitation provision does not limit a common-law right, but, rather, is contained in the same Act which creates the right being limited, the limitation is \"substantive\" and not \"procedural.\" For this reason, it held, \"[f]ailure to bring the action within the time prescribed \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n extinguished the cause of action.\" 332 F.2d, at 530. We granted certiorari to determine whether petitioner's suit in the Ohio state court tolled the FELA statute of limitations. \n379 \nU.S. 913\n.\n\nThere is no doubt that, as a matter of federal law, the state action here involved was properly \"commenced\" within the meaning of the federal limitation statute which provides that \"no action shall be maintained . . . unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued.\" As this Court held in Herb v. Pitcairn, \n325 \nU.S. 77, 79\n, \"when process has been adequate to bring in the parties and to start the case on a course of judicial handling which may lead to final judgment without issuance of new initial process, it is enough to commence the action within the federal statute.\" Had Ohio law permitted this state court action simply to be transferred to another state court, Herb v. Pitcairn holds that it would have been timely. The problem here, however, is that the timely state court action was not transferable under Ohio law but, rather, was dismissed, and a new action was brought in a federal court more than three years after the cause of action accrued. Nonetheless, for the reasons set out below, we hold that the principles underlying the Court's decision in Herb v. Pitcairn lead to the conclusion that petitioner's state court action tolled the federal limitation provision and therefore petitioner's federal court action here was timely.\n\nThe basic question to be answered in determining whether, under a given set of facts, a statute of limitations is to be tolled, is one \"of legislative intent whether the right shall be enforceable . . . after the prescribed time.\" Midstate Horticultural Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 356, 360\n. Classification of such a provision as \"substantive\" rather than \"procedural\" does not determine whether or under what circumstances the limitation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 427]\n\u00a0\n period may be extended.\n2\n As this Court has expressly held, the FELA limitation period is not totally inflexible, but, under appropriate circumstances, it may be extended beyond three years. Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Terminal, \n359 \nU.S. 231\n. See Osbourne v. United States, 164 F.2d 767 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Scarborough v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 178 F.2d 253 (C. A. 4th Cir.); Frabutt v. New York, C. & St. L. R. Co., 84 F. Supp. 460 (D.C. W. D. Pa.). These authorities indicate that the basic inquiry is whether congressional purpose is effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in given circumstances.\n\nIn order to determine congressional intent, we must examine the purposes and policies underlying the limitation provision, the Act itself, and the remedial scheme developed for the enforcement of the rights given by the Act. Such an examination leads us to conclude that it effectuates the basic congressional purposes in enacting this humane and remedial Act,\n3\n as well as those policies \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 428]\n\u00a0\n embodied in the Act's limitation provision, to hold that when a plaintiff begins a timely FELA action in a state court of competent jurisdiction, service of process is made upon the opposing party, and the state court action is later dismissed because of improper venue, the FELA limitation is tolled during the pendency of the state action.\n\nStatutes of limitations are primarily designed to assure fairness to defendants. Such statutes \"promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared. The theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\" Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., \n321 \nU.S. 342, 348\n-349. Moreover, the courts ought to be relieved of the burden of trying stale claims when a plaintiff has slept on his rights.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThis policy of repose, designed to protect defendants, is frequently outweighed, however, where the interests of justice require vindication of the plaintiff's rights. Thus, this Court has held that an FELA action is not barred, though brought more than three years after the cause of action accrued, where a defendant misled the plaintiff into believing that he had more than three years in which to bring the action. Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Terminal, supra. Moreover, it has been held that the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 429]\n\u00a0\n FELA limitation provision is tolled when war has prevented a plaintiff from bringing his suit, even though a defendant in such a case might not know of the plaintiff's disability and might believe that the statute of limitations renders him immune from suit. See Osbourne v. United States, supra; Frabutt v. New York, C. & St. L. R. Co., supra. In such cases a plaintiff has not slept on his rights but, rather, has been prevented from asserting them.\n\nConsiderations in favor of tolling the federal statute of limitations in this case are similar to those leading to an extension of the limitation period in the cases mentioned above. Petitioner here did not sleep on his rights but brought an action within the statutory period in a state court of competent jurisdiction. Service of process was made upon the respondent notifying him that petitioner was asserting his cause of action. While venue was improper in the state court, under Ohio law venue objections may be waived by the defendant,\n5\n and evidently in past cases defendant railroads, including this respondent, had waived objections to venue so that suits by nonresidents of Ohio could proceed in state courts.\n6\n Petitioner, then, failed to file an FELA action in the federal courts, not because he was disinterested, but solely because he felt that his state action was sufficient. Respondent \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 430]\n\u00a0\n could not have relied upon the policy of repose embodied in the limitation statute, for it was aware that petitioner was actively pursuing his FELA remedy; in fact, respondent appeared specially in the Ohio court to file a motion for dismissal on grounds of improper venue.\n\nBoth federal and state jurisdictions have recognized the unfairness of barring a plaintiff's action solely because a prior timely action is dismissed for improper venue after the applicable statute of limitations has run. In both federal and state systems of justice rules have been devised to prevent this from happening. Thus a federal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a), allows a district court \"of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district . . . if it be in the interest of justice,\" to \"transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\"\n7\n Congress thereby recognized that the filing of a lawsuit \"itself shows the proper diligence on the part of the plaintiff which . . . statutes of limitation were intended to insure. If by reason of the uncertainties of proper venue a mistake is made . . . `the interest of justice' may require that the complaint . . . be transferred in order that the plaintiff not be penalized by . . . `time-consuming and justice-defeating technicalities.'\" Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, \n369 \nU.S. 463, 467\n. If petitioner in this case had instituted his suit in a federal court where venue was improper, his case could simply have been transferred under 1406 (a) to a court with proper venue; the statute of limitations would not have barred his action. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe States have developed two methods for preserving causes of action which would otherwise be barred by the passing of a limitation period after a plaintiff has brought his action in a court with improper venue. The first method is analogous to the congressional statute, 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a), and permits transfer within the State from a court with improper venue to one where venue is proper.\n8\n This Court has held that when a timely FELA action is brought in a state court without proper venue and service of process issues, the statute of limitations cannot bar the action when it is later transferred to a proper state court after the limitation period has run. Herb v. Pitcairn, supra. Thus, if venue for petitioner's action were proper in some other county in Ohio, and if Ohio chose to preserve improper venue actions by means of a \"transfer\" statute, petitioner's action would not have been barred by the statute of limitations. The second method used by many States to preserve actions brought in a court where venue is improper is a \"saving\" statute.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 432]\n\u00a0\n Such a statute specifically gives to a plaintiff whose timely action is dismissed for procedural reasons such as improper venue a specified time in which to bring a second action. Ohio has such a statute, Ohio Rev. Code 2305.19, and, had petitioner's action been one arising under Ohio law, he would have had an additional year in which to file his action in a proper court. State causes of action brought in a court where venue is improper are preserved by one or the other of these two methods in 44 States.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThese factors point to the conclusion that Congress did not intend the statute of limitations to bar a plaintiff who brings a timely FELA action in a state court of competent jurisdiction, who serves the defendant with process, and whose action is later dismissed for improper venue. This does not mean that we can accept petitioner's argument that the federal limitation provision \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 433]\n\u00a0\n incorporates the Ohio Saving Statute. To allow the limitation provision to incorporate state saving statutes would produce nonuniform periods of limitation in the several States. The scope of such statutes and the length of additional time they allow vary considerably from State to State.\n11\n Moreover, not all States have saving statutes.\n12\n This Court has long recognized that the FELA \"has a uniform operation, and neither is nor can be deflected therefrom by local statutes.\" Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 392\n; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 55. This Court has also specifically held that \"[t]he period of time within which an action may be commenced is a material element in . . . [a] uniformity of operation\" which Congress would not wish \"to be destroyed by the varying provisions of the state statutes of limitation.\" Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33, 39\n. The incorporation of variant state saving statutes would defeat the aim of a federal limitation provision designed to produce national uniformity.\n\nOn the other hand, to accept respondent's argument that the limitation provision is not tolled under the circumstances present here would do even greater violence to the policies underlying the limitation provision and the Act. It would produce a substantial nonuniformity by creating a procedural anomaly. A plaintiff who brings a timely FELA action in a federal court where venue is improper would not be barred by the subsequent running of the limitation period, 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a), nor would a plaintiff who brings a timely FELA action in a state \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 434]\n\u00a0\n court where venue is improper be barred by the subsequent running of the limitation period provided that the State has a \"transfer\" statute and venue is proper elsewhere in the State. Herb v. Pitcairn, supra. However, a similar plaintiff in a state court would be barred from further actions by the running of the limitation period if the State relies upon a \"saving\" statute, rather than a \"transfer\" statute to preserve similar state actions.\n13\n Thus, in effect, a nonuniform limitation provision would be produced. Yet, as we have pointed out, a major reason for having a federal limitation provision was to achieve national uniformity. Engel v. Davenport, supra. Moreover, to accept respondent's position could only discourage FELA actions in the courts of certain States. Yet Congress, in providing for concurrent state and federal court jurisdiction and prohibiting removal of FELA cases to federal courts, has sought to protect the plaintiff's right to bring an FELA action in a state court. See Great Northern R. Co. v. Alexander, \n246 \nU.S. 276\n. Cf. Gibson, The Venue Clause and Transportation of Lawsuits, 18 Law & Contemp. Prob. 367 (1953). Further, as we have pointed out, both Congress and the States have made clear, through various procedural statutes, their desire to prevent timely actions brought in courts with improper venue from being time-barred merely because the limitation period expired while the action was in the improper court. Finally, the humanitarian purpose of the FELA makes clear that Congress would not wish a plaintiff deprived of his rights when no policy underlying a statute of limitations is served in doing so.\n\nThese considerations thus lead us to conclude that when a plaintiff begins a timely FELA action in a state court having jurisdiction, and serves the defendant with process \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 435]\n\u00a0\n and plaintiff's case is dismissed for improper venue, the FELA limitation is tolled during the pendency of the state suit. We believe that the interests of uniformity embodied in the Act are best served by holding that this rule, tolling the statute, applies in all States regardless of whether or not a State has a \"saving\" statute. We further hold, under familiar principles which have been applied to statutes of limitations, that the limitation provision is tolled until the state court order dismissing the state action becomes final by the running of the time during which an appeal may be taken or the entry of a final judgment on appeal.\n14\n While this rule produces a minor nonuniformity since the time allowed for taking an appeal is not the same in all States, to adopt state \"saving\" statutes would be far less uniform. The period \"saved\" under such statutes varies widely among the States, and some States do not have \"saving\" statutes. Similarly, to toll the federal statute for a \"reasonable time\" after the state court orders the plaintiff's action dismissed would create uncertainty as to exactly when the limitation period again begins to run. This uncertainty would be compounded by applying the equitable doctrine of \"laches\" to the federal lawsuit brought after the dismissal of the state court action. Whether laches bars an action in a given case depends upon the circumstances of that case and \"is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court.\" Gardner v. Panama R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 29, 30\n. To apply it here would be at variance with the policies of certainty and uniformity underlying this statute of limitations. We conclude that a uniform rule tolling the federal statute for the period of the pendency of the state \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 436]\n\u00a0\n court action and until the state court dismissal order becomes final is fair to both plaintiff and defendant, carries out the purposes of the FELA, and best serves the policies of uniformity and certainty underlying the federal limitation provision.\n\nApplying these principles to the present case, since petitioner brought a timely suit in the Ohio court, served defendant with process, and, after finding the state action dismissed for improper venue, filed his suit in the Federal District Court only eight days after the Ohio court dismissed his action, before his time for appealing from the Ohio order had expired, his federal court action was timely. The Court of Appeals decision affirming the District Court's dismissal of petitioner's action is therefore reversed, and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Counsel for petitioner stated at oral argument that the constitutionality of this special venue provision for actions against railroads was being challenged in other litigation. No constitutional issue was raised in these proceedings, and we express no views upon any such question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The distinction between substantive and procedural statutes of limitations appears to have arisen in cases involving conflicts of laws, see The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199\n; Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451\n; Restatement of the Law, Conflict of Laws 605. While the embodiment of a limitation provision in the statute creating the right which it modifies might conceivably indicate a legislative intent that the right and limitation be applied together when the right is sued upon in a foreign forum, the fact that the right and limitation are written into the same statute does not indicate a legislative intent as to whether or when the statute of limitations should be tolled. Thus the \"substantive\"-\"procedural\" distinction would seem to be of little help in deciding questions of extending the limitation period. See Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Terminal, \n359 \nU.S. 231\n; Developments in the Law - Statutes of Limitations, 63 Harv. L. Rev. 1177, 1186-1188 (1950); Note, 72 Yale L. J. 600, 604-605 (1963).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 507\n. See also Griffith, The Vindication of a National Public Policy under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 18 Law & Contemp. Prob. 160 (1953).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See The Act of Limitation with a Proviso, 32 Hen. 8, c. 2 (1540): \"Forasmuch as the Time of Limitation appointed for suing . . . extend, and be of so far and long Time past, that it is above the Remembrance of any living Man, truly to try and know the perfect Certainty of such Things, as hath or shall come in Trial . . . to the great Danger of Mens Consciences that have or shall be impanelled in any Jury for the Trial of the same . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Skelly v. Jefferson State Bank, 9 Ohio St. 606; Ohio Southern R. Co. v. Morey, 47 Ohio St. 207, 24 N. E. 269.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Because of the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code 2307.37, venue in a suit for injuries to person or property against a railroad is proper only in the county where the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides. Thus venue in an action by a resident of a foreign state against a railroad arising out of an accident outside the State is not proper anywhere within Ohio. Railroads can agree to venue in an Ohio state court in such a case, however, and evidently they have so agreed, as we were told on oral argument, for cases can be found which involve accidents occurring, and plaintiffs who reside, outside the county where suit was brought. See, e. g., Woodworth v. New York Central R. Co., 149 Ohio St. 543, 80 N. E. 2d 142.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Numerous cases hold that when dismissal of an action for improper venue would terminate rights without a hearing on the merits because plaintiff's action would be barred by a statute of limitations, \"the interest of justice\" requires that the cause be transferred.

Instead I rest simply on the ground that \"when process has been adequate to bring in the parties and to start the case on a course of judicial handling which may lead to final judgment without issuance of new initial process, it is enough to commence the action within the federal statute.\" \n325 \nU.S., at 79\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 437]\n\u00a0\n (Emphasis supplied.)

Gardner v. Panama R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 29, 30\n-31. That familiar equitable doctrine provides the defendant with adequate protection against delay. The Court rejects this established doctrine, however, creating a new statute of limitations of its own which makes the timeliness of a federal cause of action depend on state time requirements which were adopted for other, unrelated purposes and which vary from State to State. The long-established federal rule of laches, in contrast, is uncomplicated, uniform, and directly responsive to the problem. Laches, of course, has no application in the instant case, as petitioner filed in the federal court only eight days after his state court action had been dismissed. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 424, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNHAM VAN SERVICE v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nEl Paso Natural Gas Co. is an interstate natural gas pipeline company that delivers gas at the Arizona-California border to three California distribution companies. The present controversy concerns gas to be purchased by it in Texas from Lo-Vaca Gathering Co. and Houston Pipe Line Co. Under Lo-Vaca's contract gas produced in Texas is to be delivered to a subsidiary of El Paso's at a Texas point for delivery into its pipeline. The contract contains the following two clauses:\n\n \"All of the gas to be purchased by El Paso from Gatherer [Lo-Vaca] under this agreement shall be used by El Paso solely as fuel in El Paso's compressors, treating plants, boilers, camps and other facilities located outside of the State of Texas. It is understood, however, that said gas will be commingled with other gas being transported in El Paso's pipe line system.\"\n\n\n \"It is the intent and understanding of the parties hereto that the sale of natural gas hereof is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission because this sale is not for resale.\"\n\n\n This \"restricted use\" agreement provides for a separate metering of the contract volumes prior to their delivery into El Paso's system. El Paso will meter the gas used \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 368]\n\u00a0\n for fuel purposes in its New Mexico and Arizona facilities to make certain this amount invariably exceeds the volumes of gas taken from Lo-Vaca under this agreement.\n\nEl Paso and Houston made a similar contract containing a similar \"restricted use\" provision by which El Paso covenants that this Houston gas will be consumed by El Paso solely as fuel in its Texas operations or in another Texas plant. This contract, like the other one, also provides for metering the volume of gas delivered in Texas; and it includes a covenant by El Paso that the Texas uses will at all times exceed the amounts supplied by Houston.\n\nIn spite of these \"restricted use\" covenants it is conceded that the gas sold by Lo-Vaca and Houston to El Paso will flow in a commingled stream with gas from other sources and that at least a portion of the gas will in fact be resold out of Texas.\n\nThe Federal Power Commission asserted jurisdiction over these sales as sales in interstate commerce \"for resale,\" as that term is used in 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C. 717 (1958 ed.).\n1\n 26 F. P. C. 606, rehearing denied, id., at 840. The Court of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting. 323 F.2d 190. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 951\n.\n\nWe said in Connecticut Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n324 \nU.S. 515, 529\n, \"Federal jurisdiction was to follow the flow of electric energy, an engineering and scientific, rather than a legalistic or governmental, test.\" And that is the test we have followed under both the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act, except as Congress itself has substituted a so-called legal standard for the technological one. Id., at 530-531. In Interstate Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n331 \nU.S. 682, 687\n, we considered the anatomy of the pipeline system to discover the channel of the constant flow; again in Federal Power Comm'n v. East Ohio Gas Co., \n338 \nU.S. 464, 467\n; and most recently in Federal Power Comm'n v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., \n376 \nU.S. 205, 209\n, n. 5. The result of our decisions is to make the sale of gas which crosses a state line at any stage of its movement from wellhead to ultimate consumption \"in interstate commerce\" within the meaning of the Act.\n\nAttempts have been made by one convention or another to convert a local transaction into one of interstate commerce (Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163\n; Superior Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n280 \nU.S. 390\n) or to make a segment of interstate commerce appear to be only intrastate (Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Settle, \n260 \nU.S. 166\n). But those attempts have failed. Similarly, we conclude that when it comes to the question what gas is for \"resale\" the present contracts should not be able to change the jurisdictional result.\n\nThe fact that a substantial part of the gas will be resold, in our view, invokes federal jurisdiction at the outset over the entire transaction. Were suppliers of gas and pipeline companies free to allocate by contract gas from a particular source to a particular use, havoc would be raised with the federal regulatory scheme, as it was construed \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 370]\n\u00a0\n and applied in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, \n347 \nU.S. 672\n. A pipeline would then be able to discriminate in favor of its \"nonjurisdictional\" customers. Moreover, a pipeline company by a contract clause could immunize a particular supplier from the reach of federal regulation\n2\n as defined by Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, supra. There would be created in those and in other ways an \"attractive gap\" in the federal regulatory scheme (Federal Power Comm'n v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., \n365 \nU.S. 1, 28\n) which the producing States might have little incentive to close, since the gap would often involve either lower costs to intrastate customers or else merely higher pipeline costs which ultimately would be reflected in rates paid by consumers in other States. Whether cases could be conjured up where in spite of original commingling there might be a separate so-called nonjurisdictional transaction\n3\n of a precise amount of gas not-for-resale\n4\n within the meaning of the Act is a question we need not reach. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 371]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally it is said that the Commission should draw the appropriate lines between \"jurisdictional\" and \"nonjurisdictional\" sales through the use of its rule-making power. But we cannot say that the adjudicatory process is not an appropriate method for drawing the line case-by-case (United States v. Public Utilities Comm'n, \n345 \nU.S. 295\n) as in a host of other administrative determinations. The Commission has acted responsibly in this situation and its decision must be upheld.\n\n       Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 (b) of the Act provides:\n\n\"The provisions of this Act shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.\"\n\n\n Section 2 (7) of the Act reads as follows:\n\n\"When used in this Act, unless the context otherwise requires -\n\n.   .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"(7) `Interstate commerce' means commerce between any point in a State and any point outside thereof, or between points within the same State but through any place outside thereof, but only insofar as such commerce takes place within the United States.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commission's Report, Statistics of Natural Gas Companies - 1962, shows that the 40 major natural gas pipeline companies consumed more than $85,000,000 worth of gas in operating their facilities (principally compressor stations), p. xviii. This represents almost 4% of the total gas-purchase-costs of those companies. The Commission therefore points out in its brief that pipeline companies, merely by using \"restricted use\" controls, could without changing their actual operations create a substantial unregulated market for the benefit of particular producers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Our reference in Federal Power Comm'n v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., \n365 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, to \"direct\" sales of gas to industrial users as nonjurisdictional sales is not dispositive of the present issue. For the Commission had refused a certificate for transportation of the gas because from the standpoint of conservation it considered the end use as boiler fuel to be inferior. Whether the Commission had authority to assert jurisdiction over the so-called \"direct\" sale because it was \"for resale\" as a result of its commingling with other gas was not in issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf. United States v. Public Utilities Comm'n, \n345 \nU.S. 295, 317\n-318; City of Hastings v. Federal Power Comm'n, 221 F.2d 31.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nToday's decision furnishes a too-ready answer to an intricate problem of administrative regulation. It reflects the sort of decision that is to be expected when the Court is willing to make a bare choice between two unrefined points of view as to regulatory method, without first being informed by the regulating agency concerned as to its evaluation of the competing factors - something that is indispensable to achieving a well-balanced solution of a problem such as this. The respective positions of the parties here each possesses the capacity to frustrate the scope of natural gas regulation ordained by the Congress. The Commission's molecular theory, accepted by the Court with undefined reservations, results in expanding the regulatory scheme by sweeping within the Commission's authority gas that has not been supplied or used for interstate resale (\"nonjurisdictional\" gas). The respondents' contract-allocation position, on the other hand, might serve to contract the legitimate scope of regulation by interfering with the ability of the Commission to deal with gas restricted under a supply contract to \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 372]\n\u00a0\n \"not-for-sale,\" but which has been actually used by the pipeline-purchaser for interstate resale (\"jurisdictional\" gas).\n\nWhether or not there is a middle ground that would more closely fulfill the purposes of the Natural Gas Act than either of the proposals now before us is something that this Court is not competent to assess without expert guidance from the Commission, and we have been given none. Lacking this, I am unwilling to accept at this juncture the position of either party to this litigation. I think the Court should decline to pass upon these cases until the Commission has first illumined the regulatory problems involved through an appropriate exercise of its rule-making powers.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe complexity and elusiveness of the matters with which we are asked to deal are best exposed from the vantage point of this Court by considering some of the questions to which allocation contracts in varying contexts give rise.\n\nThe Commission has, at least until this case, accepted the proposition that a single supplier to a pipeline may allocate by contract between the amount of gas used for jurisdictional purposes and the amount used nonjurisdictionally. For example, in City of Hastings v. Federal Power Comm'n, 221 F.2d 31, a pipeline company sold gas to the city through one pipeline under two contracts, one covering the gas to be resold by the city, and the other gas to be used by the city in its own plants. Although the gas was mingled in the common pipeline, the allocation was approved, and the latter gas was, without more, considered not subject to Commission regulation. A similar situation was presented in United States v. Public Utilities Comm'n of California, \n345 \nU.S. 295\n, where a power company sold electricity to the Navy for \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 373]\n\u00a0\n use in its power plants and also for resale to dependent families. The absence of any allocation was fatal in that case, but the Court recognized that a different question would be presented if there had been two separate transactions. \n345 \nU.S., at 316\n-318.\n\nThe result does not change when two or more suppliers are involved, provided that the allocation of nonjurisdictional gas is prorated among all of the suppliers. For example, if a pipeline company consumed 30% of its total volume of gas in its own plants, and sold 10% of the total volume in the State of production, each supplier could allocate 40% of its gas supply to nonjurisdictional use. Such was essentially the case in North Dakota v. Federal Power Comm'n, 247 F.2d 173, where the allocation was upheld with Commission approval. If these cases are accepted by the Court, two corollaries follow: since gas is a fungible commodity, the mingling of gas does not alone render ineffective for purposes of Commission jurisdiction the allocation contracts, although the molecular identification of the nonjurisdictional gas is destroyed; and the fact that the prices paid for nonjurisdictional gas\n2\n may affect the rate base for the jurisdictional gas, is also not a critical factor at this stage.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 374]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe issue now before the Court arises only when some suppliers are allocating part or all of their gas to nonjurisdictional use, but others are not. This issue could arise commonly in two contexts: if existing suppliers were allocating pro rata, and new suppliers were added which did not allocate, the addition of the new suppliers might be thought not to destroy the validity of the existing allocation contracts since the new suppliers might be satisfying an increase in the demand for jurisdictional gas.\n4\n The converse situation is presented in this case, where the new suppliers are attempting to allocate, and existing suppliers are not. One possible test in such cases might be to determine the source of the demand for the gas supplied to El Paso by Houston and Lo-Vaca. To modify the argument used by respondents, if a separate pipeline were constructed from the Coquat station (at which the gas enters the El Paso system) to the point along El Paso's system where the outflow will increase, would the sale be jurisdictional or not? If in fact El Paso has formerly been using the same amount of gas in its compressors that it intends to use in the future, then the purpose of the Lo-Vaca allocation will be merely to release for interstate sale - to satisfy the interstate demand - gas from other suppliers which formerly was used for nonjurisdictional purposes.\n\nThe record before us does not answer the question put. There is some indication that El Paso intends to construct new compressor plants, and may have to use more nonjurisdictional gas at its existing plants to handle the added gas received from Lo-Vaca under the unrestricted contract. Such a use would satisfy a nonjurisdictional demand. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 375]\n\u00a0\n However, there is also evidence that in fact El Paso's consumption for nonjurisdictional purposes will remain constant, and that Lo-Vaca's supplies will be used to satisfy an increased demand from interstate consumers. The fact that Lo-Vaca gas purportedly replaces the compressor gas supplies formerly furnished by other suppliers, thus releasing that gas for interstate resale, should not defeat Commission jurisdiction under this analysis.\n\nAnother possible standard which suggests itself would be to determine the probable percentages of gas from each supplier which will be used for nonjurisdictional purposes, and only permit each supplier to allocate by contract to nonjurisdictional use his pro rata share of the total estimated nonjurisdictional gas. For example, if we suppose a pipeline running from the Gulf coast of Texas through New Mexico into California, as does the El Paso system, then each supplier should determine what percentage of the total volume of gas flowing west from the point of its input will be ultimately used for a nonjurisdictional purpose. It would then be mathematically probable that his gas would be used for nonjurisdictional purposes in the same percentage, and he could allocate that amount by contract, subject to change should new supplies be added to the system.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nI recognize, of course, that there may be pitfalls in both of these possible methods, and that there may be other formulae that are preferable to either. I have ventured \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 376]\n\u00a0\n them only as support for my belief that the Commission's molecular theory, which in the name of protecting the Commission's jurisdiction in reality involves a judicial expansion of its authority, should not be accepted until the Commission, after due exploration in a rule-making proceeding, is able to satisfy this Court that no other feasible method - more particularly no modification of the respondents' contract-allocation theory - exists that would better fit the boundaries of the Commission's jurisdiction as fixed by Congress.\n\nIt is undoubtedly true that normally an administrative agency may decide for itself whether to proceed in a given field of its regulatory functions through the promulgation of general rules\n6\n or by the process of case-by-case adjudication.\n7\n This Commission from the outset has usually proceeded, with the Court's approval,\n8\n in developing its procedures by the adjudicatory process. Nevertheless, there are good reasons why the rule-making power appears to be the more promising avenue of approach in this instance. First, the adjudicatory process has not yielded any satisfactory basic principle to serve as a point of departure for judicial assessment of cases of this kind, or indeed for a consistent administrative approach;\n9\n even in this litigation the Commission's position is far from clear as to what room, if any, there may be for restrictive allocation contracts. Second, the gas industry is entitled to know the fundamental ground rules by which it should \n\n[379 \nU.S. 366, 377]\n\u00a0\n conduct itself in this regard with some degree of predictability, as witness the situation of these respondents whose good faith in the transactions giving rise to this litigation has not been impugned in any way. Third, that unlike the line of cases in which agency jurisdiction is conceded,\n10\n here the Commission should not be permitted to adopt a theory which expands its jurisdiction beyond statutory limits\n11\n without full hearings and the formulation of a rule interpreting its jurisdiction in this area which conforms to the jurisdictional limits of 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act. Fourth, because these matters are fraught with technical \"perplexities, both geological and economic,\" Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., \n311 \nU.S. 570, 574\n, the informed expertise of the Commission is a necessary adjunct to satisfactory judicial resolution of particular cases. \"Had the Commission, acting upon its experience and peculiar competence, promulgated a general rule of which its order here was a particular application, the problem for our consideration would be very different.\" Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80, 92\n. The courts have a right to the informed judgment of the Commission before acting further in this presently opaque area.\n\nI would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings after the promulgation of interpretive rules to cover this, and like cases.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Elman, Comment, Rulemaking Procedures in the FTC's Enforcement of the Merger Law, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 385 (1964).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Court's opinion, ante, p. 370. In fact, the price charged by Lo-Vaca for its nonjurisdictional gas is exactly the same as the price established for its concededly jurisdictional sale, and the Houston sale is for a price lower than either of the Lo-Vaca sales.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Both Lo-Vaca and El Paso are constructing pipelines to connect with the El Paso system at its Coquat station, and both must obtain Commission certification under 7 of the Natural Gas Act in order to construct such pipelines. The Commission could take many of the factors presented in this case into account when ruling on the applications, see Federal Power Comm'n v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., \n365 \nU.S. 1\n. The Commission could also take into account the reasonableness of the prices charged for nonjurisdictional gas should El Paso apply for a rate increase on its jurisdictional sales.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 334 F.2d 404 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1964), cert. pending, No. 585, this Term, where the suppliers in the North Dakota case, supra, had been allocating, and the pipeline then added new suppliers which did not allocate. The Court of Appeals upheld the allocation contracts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Corrections would have to be made, of course, where gas is withdrawn for intrastate consumption from a trunk line before the gas is mingled with the interstate system. Such gas would all be attributed to the suppliers feeding the trunk line, and this gas would not be used in computing the total percentages. Cf. Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of Pennsylvania, \n270 \nU.S. 550\n. This method of allocation would only operate with natural gas, which flows in one direction only; different considerations would be applicable were we dealing with electric power, which can flow in both directions along a system.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See United States v.

The case also involves the question whether, having passed such a law, valid on its face, the State can prosecute offenders in its own courts or whether United States courts have power to enjoin all state prosecutions merely because of a charge that the law is unconstitutional on its face, without first determining the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nEvery person who has the slightest information about what is going on in this country can understand the importance of these issues. The summary disposition the Court makes of this case fails properly to enlighten state or federal courts or the people who deserve to know what are the rights of the people, the rights of affected groups, the rights of the Federal Government, and the rights of the States in this field of activities which encompasses some of the most burning, pressing and important issues of our time. There are many earnest, honest, good people in this Nation who are entitled to know exactly how far they have a constitutional right to go in using the public streets to advocate causes they consider just. State officials are also entitled to the same information. The Court has already waited entirely too long, in my judgment, to perform its duty of clarifying these constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 743]\n\u00a0\n issues.\n1\n These issues are of such great importance that I am of the opinion that before this Court relegates the States to the position of mere onlookers in struggles over their streets and the accesses to their public buildings, this Court should at least write an opinion making clear to the States and interested people the boundaries between what they can do in this field and what they cannot. Today's esoteric and more or less mysterious per curiam order gives no such information.\n\nThis action was brought by and on behalf of picketers and demonstrators in Mississippi, some of whom have charges now pending against them which were brought in the Mississippi state courts\n2\n for violating a Mississippi statute which provided:\n\n \"It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert with others, to engage in picketing or mass demonstrations in such a manner as to obstruct or interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any public premises, State property, county or municipal courthouses, city halls, office buildings, jails, or other \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 744]\n\u00a0\n public buildings or property owned by the State of Mississippi or any county or municipal government located therein or with the transaction of public business or administration of justice therein or thereon conducted or so as to obstruct or interfere with free use of public streets, sidewalks or other public ways adjacent or contiguous thereto.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n Their complaint in the United States District Court asked that the Governor of Mississippi and other state officials be enjoined from enforcing the statute against them and others. The complaint alleged that the law was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the plaintiffs and persons similarly situated because the language of the statute was so vague and ambiguous that a person of ordinary intelligence could not understand it, and so broad and sweeping in its terms that it could be used, had been used, and would be used, to harass and persecute the plaintiffs and others, not merely for blocking streets and doors and passageways, but also for simply picketing and demonstrating, activities which this statute does not prohibit.\n4\n They alleged in addition that the Mississippi Legislature actually passed the law to discourage picketers and demonstrators from protesting against state denial of voting rights to Negroes. The District Court majority found as a fact on the evidence stipulated by the parties that neither the plaintiffs nor anyone else had been interfered with for simply picketing and demonstrating,\n5\n and also found that\n\n\"on the occasions in suit when some of the plaintiffs were arrested and charged with violating this Act. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 745]\n\u00a0\n that such persons deliberately and intentially [sic] blocked the sidewalk and one of the entrances to the county courthouse in Forest County, Mississippi, by walking so close together as to make use of such entrance and exit to and from said county courthouse by the officials and business visitors impossible.\"\n\n\n The District Court held that no serious claim could be made that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or too broad on its face, and therefore refused to issue an injunction forbidding the prosecution of offenses under that law. And having found from the evidence that there had been no harassment of the plaintiffs, except as harassment could be said to exist in the ordinary enforcement of any valid law, the court refused to enjoin the state officials from enforcing the law against them and others, and dismissed the complaint.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIf, as I believe, the Mississippi statute is not unconstitutional on its face, then the District Court in dismissing the complaint and leaving the trials to the state courts acted in accordance with an unbroken line of this Court's cases going back to the early days of this country. See, e. g., Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n; Watson v. Buck, \n313 \nU.S. 387\n; Beal v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 45\n; Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89\n; Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240\n. It is true that Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, held that state officials could be enjoined from harassing people by starting multitudinous criminal prosecutions against them where severe \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 746]\n\u00a0\n cumulative punishments might accrue before the constitutionality of the state law involved could be tested. In the absence of some such extraordinary situation, however, this Court has uniformly held that federal courts should refrain from interfering with enforcement of state criminal laws. Thus in Douglas v. City of Jeannette, supra, this Court found no reason to permit a federal court to enjoin a state criminal proceeding even though the statute involved was the same day declared unconstitutional in a similar application. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court in its cryptic per curiam order directs that \"On remand, the District Court should first consider whether 28 U.S.C. 2283 (1958 ed.) bars a federal injunction in this case . . . .\" But the District Court has already considered 2283\n8\n and at the very beginning of its opinion stated that 2283\n\n\". . . is not jurisdictional, but expresses very clearly and definitely the policy and thinking of Congress. Such a statute has been on the books for many years and still stands in the above quoted form. Certainly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 747]\n\u00a0\n there are times and occasions which are exceptional, when it is proper for the Court to enjoin the prosecution of a criminal case, but the facts of this case and of this record do not approach such a situation.\" ___ F. Supp., at ___.\n\n\n The appellants argue that 28 U.S.C. 2283, which bars injunctions against actions already instituted in state courts, is not applicable here because the pending prosecutions were removed and the remand orders have been stayed, and because in this class action \"The basic relief sought in the complaint is the enjoining of the prospective enforcement of the state statute . . . .\" The question of applicability of 2283 is here on appeal, and if the Court is uncertain about that statute's application here it has the duty to decide the question now and not remand to the lower court which has already decided it.\n\nThe Court's exceedingly brief order directs the District Court on remand, if 2283 does not bar this action, to \"determine whether relief is proper in light of the criteria set forth in Dombrowski\" v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S. 479\n. Apparently the Court means to indicate that this recent decision created a new rule authorizing federal courts to enjoin state officers from enforcing state laws even though clearly and narrowly drawn to forbid picketers and demonstrators from obstructing street traffic and blocking the entrances of public buildings. The Court by citing Dombrowski seems to be indicating the existence of such a rule, since it would be a futile gesture to remand the case to the District Court merely to have it state formally what it said in dismissing under the Jeannette rule before: that \"There is no basis of fact in this record or by a reasonable construction of the statute by which its constitutionality could be doubted.\" Since the District Court has expressed its view that the statute is constitutional on its face and has found in addition that there has been no unlawful harassing application of it, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 748]\n\u00a0\n there is no reason for us to remand the case to the District Court unless this Court wants either to upset the District Court's findings of fact or to order the District Court to hold, as this Court held about a subversive activities statute in Dombrowski, that the statute challenged is also unconstitutional on its face.\n\nI did not participate in Dombrowski, but I do not think it is applicable here. Dombrowski did approve federal district court injunctions to prevent state officers from enforcing a state statute alleged and found to be void on its face as a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments on the ground that over breadth made it susceptible of sweeping and improper application abridging freedom of expression, where it was also alleged that the statute was part of a plan \"to employ arrests, seizures, and threats of prosecution\" under the statute in a way that would discourage the complainants and their supporters from asserting and attempting to vindicate their constitutional rights. This Court in Dombrowski held, as I read the opinion, that an injunction against any enforcement of any kind of the state statute (as distinguished from an order enjoining state officers from committing lawless acts) could issue there only because (1) there were threats of prosecutions purely to harass, with no hope of ultimate success, (2) the law was challenged as, and found to be on its face, an \"overly broad and vague regulation of expression,\" and (3) \"no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statute in a single prosecution . . . .\" Crucial to the holding in Dombrowski that any enforcement whatever of the statute should be enjoined was this Court's finding that the statute involved was unconstitutional on its face. This is clearly shown by the Court's statement that:\n\n\"[A]bstention serves no legitimate purpose where a statute regulating speech is properly attacked on its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 749]\n\u00a0\n face, and where, as here, the conduct charged in the indictments is not within the reach of an acceptable limiting construction readily to be anticipated as the result of a single criminal prosecution and is not the sort of `hard-core' conduct that would obviously be prohibited under any construction.\" \n380 \nU.S., at 491\n-492. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Dombrowski also indicate to me that there might be cases in which state or federal officers, acting under color of a law which is valid, could be enjoined from engaging in unlawful conduct which deprives persons of their federally guaranteed statutory or constitutional rights. Compare 17 Stat. 13, 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1958 ed.). Stating these bases for permitting injunction against all enforcement in Dombrowski, most of which bases are not present here, is enough without more to show that Dombrowski cannot control the decision in this case. Here there is no allegation of improper conduct by law enforcement officers, and in fact, there is a specific finding to the contrary. And certainly the one unquestionably indispensable ingredient of Dombrowski required for a blanket injunction on enforcement - a finding that the statute is unconstitutionally vague or broad on its face - is absent here unless the Court is convinced, without even hearing argument, that this Mississippi statute is unconstitutional on its face as an infringement on constitutionally protected expression.\n\nI think that no such claim of unconstitutionality on its face can possibly be maintained. What the Mississippi statute forbids is so clear that any person of ordinary intelligence can or should understand it. I find it hard to take seriously a vagueness argument, since I doubt that there is a fourth grade schoolboy in this country who would not understand that the statute forbids him. either alone or with others, to block or obstruct ingress and egress to and from Mississippi public buildings (here \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 750]\n\u00a0\n a courthouse) and to obstruct free use of the streets adjacent to those public properties. Nor is the statute overly broad in what it covers. It does not even undertake to forbid or regulate picketing or demonstrating on the streets (as I think it could - see Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 575\n (concurring opinion); Labor Board v. Fruit & Vegetable Packers, \n377 \nU.S. 58, 76\n (concurring opinion)). It simply modestly provides that those who carry on such activities shall do so in a way that will not obstruct others who want to use the streets to travel or want to go in or out of a public building. The Mississippi statute is narrowly and precisely drawn, patently designed to accomplish this objective. Thus it fits this Court's often-repeated description of the kind of law which should be drawn in the State's exercise of its generally unquestioned constitutional power to regulate picketing and street activities. See, e. g., Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 554\n-555; Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 105\n; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n-161. Far from questioning the power of States to regulate conduct on the streets and in public buildings, this Court said in Schneider v. State, supra, at 160:\n\n \"Municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, have the duty to keep their communities' streets open and available for movement of people and property, the primary purpose to which the streets are dedicated. So long as legislation to this end does not abridge the constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature, it may lawfully regulate the conduct of those using the streets. For example, a person could not exercise this liberty by taking his stand in the middle of a crowded street, contrary to traffic regulations, and maintain his position to the stoppage of all traffic . . . .\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 751]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n It would seem inconsistent with our whole federal system to say that the Federal Constitution somehow takes away from States and their subdivisions the general power to control their streets and ingress and egress to and from their public buildings and other public properties. Such state control would have to be exercised consistently with special federal constitutional guarantees, such as the right not to be discriminated against on account of race, color or religion; but the statute here does not, on its face, draw any such invidious discriminations and the statute is attacked on its face. And of course Mississippi has no less power over its public buildings and streets than does any other State.\n\nThe Mississippi statute is in many respects like one that this Court sustained a few months ago against a challenge that it was void for vagueness on its face, and that it was an unjustified restriction upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. That statute, modeled after an Act of Congress passed in 1950, 64 Stat. 1018, 18 U.S.C. 1507 (1958 ed.) made it an offense in Louisiana to picket or parade in or near a courthouse with an intent of interfering with or obstructing or impeding the administration of justice. The Court's opinion stated:\n\n\"The conduct which is the subject of this statute - picketing and parading - is subject to regulation even though intertwined with expression and association.\" Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 563\n.\n\n\n And in a companion case, decided the same day, this Court stated: \"Governmental authorities have the duty and responsibility to keep their streets open and available for movement.\" Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 554\n-555. \"A group of demonstrators,\" this Court said, \"could not insist upon the right to cordon off a street, or entrance to a public or private building, and allow no one to pass who \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 752]\n\u00a0\n did not agree to listen to their exhortations.\" Id., at 555. The Court also emphasized in that same case that the \"control of travel on the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to insure\" \"public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy.\" Id., at 554. It is true that we have only recently held that Mississippi must not deny the constitutional right of Negroes to register and vote. United States v. Mississippi, \n380 \nU.S. 128\n. But this, of course, does not mean that no good or valid law could come out of the State of Mississippi. We should without hesitation condemn as unconstitutional discriminatory voting laws of Mississippi or of any other State. We should with equal firmness, however, approve a law which on its face is designed merely to carry out the State's responsibility to protect people who want to get into and out of the State's public buildings and to move along its highways freely without obstruction.\n\nI cannot believe for one moment that this Court in Dombrowski intended to authorize federal injunctions completely suspending all enforcement of a constitutionally valid state criminal law merely because state defendants allege that state officials are about to harass them by doing no more than enforcing that valid law against them in the state courts. If Dombrowski held any such thing, I think the quicker that case is reconsidered in order to give it a \"limiting construction\" the better it will be for the courts, the States, the United States and the people in this country who want to live in an atmosphere of peace and quiet. Creating new hurdles to the conviction of people who violate valid laws cannot be ranked as one of the most pressing and exigent needs of the times, to say the least. Perhaps at no time in the Nation's history has there been a greater need to make clear to all that the United States Constitution does not render States impotent to require people permitted to advocate views and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 753]\n\u00a0\n air grievances on the streets to do so without obstructing the use of those streets by those who want to use them to move from place to place - the primary use for which all the people pay taxes to build and maintain streets.\n\nThe record in this case tells us that there are probably hundreds of cases like these in one State alone. It is not difficult to foresee that reversal of the District Court's denial of injunction here will be a signal and invitation for many, many more efforts to tie the hands of state officials in many more States on charges that threatened prosecutions under valid laws are prompted by a desire to harass. Much has been said of late about the threat to prompt and efficient administration of justice from the increasing work load of our United States courts.\n9\n If that is a valid argument in deciding cases, it is not amiss to point out that the rule which the Court implicitly adopts here is bound to bring an ever-increasing number of cases into federal courts, where state prosecutions will be enjoined until a federal court can first weigh the motives of state officials in instituting prosecutions. This of course means more and more delays between the arrests of people accused of violating state laws and their trials. The law's delays - which many believe are really a guilty man's most effective defense - are bound to be multiplied beyond measure. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that this is a big country - too big to expect the Federal Government to take over the creation and enforcement of local criminal laws throughout the country. The Nation was not formed with any such purpose in mind. It is wise and right and in conformity with the national governmental plan for federal courts to be vigilant and alert to protect federally guaranteed rights. But we put too much strain on the federal courts if we bodily transfer \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 754]\n\u00a0\n from state- to federal-court jurisdiction what is, in effect, the initial step in the trial of persons charged with violating state or local criminal laws which are far from being unconstitutional on their face. The Federal Constitution certainly does not require us to do it and, in my judgment, forbids it. I would affirm the District Court's judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] House Bill No. 546, Gen. Laws of Miss. 1964, c. 343.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Bell v. Maryland, \n378 \nU.S. 226, 242\n (opinion of DOUGLAS, J.); id., at 318 (BLACK, J., dissenting); Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, \n379 \nU.S. 306, 318\n (BLACK, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We are informed that after the decision of the District Court in the present case, 170 of the state-court defendants removed their prosecutions to a federal district court, purportedly under authority of 28 U.S.C. 1443 (1958 ed.). The Federal District Court ordered the cases remanded to the state courts. The Court of Appeals stayed the remand orders, and an appeal from those orders is now pending before the Fifth Circuit. Hartfield v. Mississippi, No. 21811; Anderson v. Mississippi, No. 21813; Carmichael v. City of Greenwood, No. 22289. It can be assumed that if appellants are unsuccessful in the Fifth Circuit they will seek review in this Court, which will take at least another year. Today's decision appears to add more devices to the collection of delaying tactics by which state criminal defendants may use collateral litigation in the federal courts to prevent their prosecutions in state courts from coming to trial for many years, if ever.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] House Bill No. 546, Gen. Laws of Miss. 1964, c. 343.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The complaint alleged that the statute violated the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"The Court, therefore, further finds as a fact that the State of Mississippi is prosecuting the plaintiffs in the state court under said picketing statute in good faith, and is fully entitled under the law to do so to conclusion of such prosecution . . . .\" ___ F. Supp., at ___.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] We understand from the District Court's opinion and conclusions of law that it did not dismiss the complaint on the ground that it thought it necessary to have the state courts construe the statute, but rather on the ground that having found the statute constitutional it dismissed in order for the criminal cases to be tried in the state courts. Moreover, whatever the reasons assigned for dismissal by the District Court, it is well established that an appellee in whose favor a judgment has been rendered is entitled to an affirmance on any proper ground.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In an opinion joined by MR. JUSTICE CLARK denying a petition for habeas corpus in similar circumstances, I stated:\n\n\"This petition for habeas corpus is denied because the factual allegations fall far short of showing that there are not Mississippi state processes available by appeal or otherwise for Petitioner to challenge her state conviction, which processes would effectively protect her constitutional rights, particularly since any denial of such rights by the highest court of a State can be remedied by appropriate appellate proceedings in the Supreme Court of the United States. See 28 U.S. Code, Sections 2241, 2254 and 1257.\" Application of Wyckoff, 6 Race Rel. L. Rep. 786, 794, discussed in Brown v. Rayfield, 320 F.2d 96, 98-99 (C.

Nebraska, ante, pp. 337, 340 (concurring opinions); Linkletter v. Walker, ante, p. 618.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.\n\nI dissent from the per curiam remand of this case on the authority of Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S. 479\n, for while I joined the opinion of the Court in Dombrowski, I do not think it is applicable here.\n\nThe appellants in Dombrowski attacked numerous and sundry provisions of Louisiana's Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and the Communist Propaganda Control Law on the ground that the statutes \"violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees securing freedom of expression, because overbreadth makes them susceptible of sweeping and improper application abridging those rights.\" \n380 \nU.S. 479, 482\n. There was also an allegation of threats to enforce these sweeping provisions as part of a \"plan to employ arrests, seizures, and threats of prosecution under color of the statutes to harass\" the appellants and to discourage their protected activities. The lower court denied relief on the ground that these allegations did not present a case of threatened irreparable injury to constitutional rights warranting the intervention of a federal court. We reversed. The Court, at the outset, fully and explicitly accepted the teaching of the cases \"that federal interference with a State's good-faith administration of its criminal laws is peculiarly inconsistent with our federal framework\" and that \"the mere possibility of erroneous initial application of constitutional standards will \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 755]\n\u00a0\n usually not amount to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state proceedings.\" \n380 \nU.S., at 484\n-485. Without questioning the rule that the possible invalidity of a state statute is not itself ground for equitable relief, Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, or the imminence of prosecution under such a statute, since no person is immune from prosecution in good faith for alleged criminal acts, Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157, 163\n-164, we held that there was a sufficient showing of threatened irreparable injury to federal rights, which could not be dissipated by a particular prosecution, to warrant equitable intervention by a federal court. What was controlling on both the exercise of equitable power and the abstention issue was the depiction of a \"situation in which defense of the State's criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitutional rights.\" \n380 \nU.S., at 485\n. The situation depicted here does not contain the elements which were operative in Dombrowski\n\nDombrowski did not hold that the traditional equitable limitations on a federal court's power to enjoin imminent or pending criminal proceedings are relaxed whenever a statute is attacked as void on its face or as applied in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Rather that case makes clear that two particular kinds of challenges to state criminal statutes warrant extraordinary intervention in a State's criminal processes. They are planned prosecutorial misuse of a statute regulating freedom of expression and a vagueness attack on such a statute. Where threats of enforcement are without any expectation of conviction and are \"part of a plan to employ arrests, seizures, and threats of prosecution under color of the statutes to harass,\" it is obvious that defense in a state criminal prosecution will not suffice to avoid irreparable injury. The very prosecution is said to be a part of the unconstitutional scheme and the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 756]\n\u00a0\n scheme, including future use of the statutes, is quite irrelevant to the prosecution in the state courts. Similarly where a plethora of statutory provisions are assailed as invalidly vague, uncertain or overbroad, with a consequent reach into areas of expression protected by the First Amendment, and such provisions are not susceptible of clarifying construction under the impact of one case, defense in the state prosecution cannot remove the unconstitutional vice of vagueness. For \"those affected by a statute are entitled to be free of the burdens of defending prosecutions, however expeditious, aimed at hammering out the structure of the statute piecemeal, with no likelihood of obviating similar uncertainty for others.\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S., at 491\n. To relegate the party to defense in a state proceeding would be likely to leave standing a statute susceptible of having a severe in terrorem effect on expression, even if one prosecuted under such a statute is not convicted. It is this reasoning that accounts for relaxation of the abstention doctrine where sweeping and unclear statutes are attacked on their face, as in Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, a case quite pertinent to the rationale of Dombrowski.\n\nHere there is no more harassment alleged than that ordinarily and necessarily entailed by a criminal prosecution based on a good faith belief that the defendants have violated a statute. Although it is said that the statute is aimed at demonstrations, and that the prosecutions interfere with them, these allegations do not charge a misuse of the statute. Indeed, the petitioners allege that the picketing said to be unlawful under it was peaceful and nonobstructive, and the State claims quite the contrary. This issue is at the core of the criminal trial and to decide it in a federal court represents a wholly duplicative adjudication of an ordinary factual matter in dispute in a state criminal trial. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 757]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor do I think that any substantial claim of vagueness or overbroadness can be made about the statute here at issue.\n1\n Its provisions are these:\n\n \"It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert with others, to engage in picketing or mass demonstrations in such a manner as to obstruct or interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any public premises, State property, county or municipal courthouses, city halls, office buildings, jails, or other public buildings or property owned by the State of Mississippi or any county or municipal government located therein or with the transaction of public business or administration of justice therein or thereon conducted or so as to obstruct or interfere with free use of public streets, sidewalks or other public ways adjacent or contiguous thereto.\"\n\n\n To me the terms \"obstruct\" and \"interfere\" raise no issues of vagueness or overbreadth such as were considered to be present in Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, and Dombrowski, \n380 \nU.S. 479\n, for the terms are neither unclear nor open-ended. The statute does not deal with belief or expression as such - it does not ban all forms of picketing, Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n; Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559\n - but rather with obstructions to and interferences with ingress or egress to and from public buildings and the sidewalks and streets contiguous thereto, assuredly permissible subjects of state regulation. Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 554\n. The statute does \"aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of state control,\" Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 97\n, and does not leave one to guess at where fanciful possibility ends and intended coverage begins. Cf. Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 373\n-375. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 758]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe constitutional challenge to this statute which thus emerges is, in my view, an assertion that the type of conduct covered by the clear terms of the statute, obstructive picketing at public buildings, for example, cannot constitutionally be proscribed. Whether the attack is made on the face of the statute or as applied is beside the point, for in neither case would there be those special circumstances which Dombrowski requires to sanction federal intervention into a State's criminal processes. Whatever \"criteria\" Dombrowski contains, they do not indicate that in this situation the ordinary rule barring injunctive relief against state criminal prosecutions should be waived.\n\n\"[T]he mere possibility of erroneous initial application of constitutional standards will usually not amount to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state proceedings,\" and what is required for extraordinary intervention is a \"situation in which defense of the State's criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitutional rights.\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S. 479, 484\n-485. In Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n, the Court denied injunctive relief against threatened application of a city ordinance to constitutionally protected religious solicitation, \"since the lawfulness or constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on which the prosecution is based may be determined as readily in the criminal case as in a suit for an injunction.\" \n319 \nU.S., at 163\n. The constitutional challenge to this Mississippi statute, unlike the attack on the statutes in Dombrowski v. Pfister and Baggett v. Bullitt, but indistinguishable from that in Douglas v. City of Jeannette, does not entail \"extensive adjudications, under the impact of a variety of factual situations.\" Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 378\n, to bring it within constitutional bounds. This is not a case where \"no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle \n\n[381 \nU.S. 741, 759]\n\u00a0\n for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution.\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S., at 491\n.\n\n\n In these circumstances it is difficult to see what hazards to federal rights are posed by requiring one to follow orderly proceedings in the state courts. Numerous cases establish that the possible invalidity of a statute, or the imminence of a prosecution under it, itself will not suffice to warrant intervention. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n; Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240\n; Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89\n; Beal v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 45\n; Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n. Dombrowski v. Pfister is not to the contrary.\n\nIt is obvious, however, that several of my Brethren find more guidance in Dombrowski than I do and more than I think a district judge can find in either that case or this unrevealing per curiam remand, which ignores the differences between this case and Dombrowski. The issues are important and of immediate concern and I would note probable jurisdiction and set this case down for argument.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] House Bill No. 546, Gen.

Held: A State can impose reasonable residence requirements for voting but it cannot, under the Equal Protection Clause, deny the ballot to a bona fide resident merely because he is a member of the armed services.

Peticolas.\n\nHawthorne Phillips, First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, and Mary K. Wall, Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause for respondents. With them on the brief was Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of Texas.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA provision of the Texas Constitution prohibits \"[a]ny member of the Armed Forces of the United States\" who moves his home to Texas during the course of his military duty from ever voting in any election in that State \"so long as he or she is a member of the Armed Forces.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n The question presented is whether this provision, as construed by the Supreme Court of Texas in the present case,\n2\n deprives the petitioner of a right secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Texas decided that it does not and refused to issue a writ of mandamus ordering petitioner's local election officials to permit him to vote, two Justices dissenting. 378 S. W. 2d 304. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\nThe petitioner, a sergeant in the United States Army, entered the service from Alabama in 1946 at the age of 18. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n The State concedes that he has been domiciled in Texas since 1962, and that he intends to make his home there permanently. He has purchased a house in El Paso where he lives with his wife and two children. He is also the proprietor of a small business there. The petitioner's post of military duty is not in Texas, but at White Sands, New Mexico. He regularly commutes from his home in El Paso to his Army job at White Sands. He pays property taxes in Texas and has his automobile registered there. But for his uniform, the State concedes that the petitioner would be eligible to vote in El Paso County, Texas.\n\nTexas has unquestioned power to impose reasonable residence restrictions on the availability of the ballot. Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621\n. There can be no doubt either of the historic function of the States to establish, on a nondiscriminatory basis, and in accordance with the Constitution, other qualifications for the exercise of the franchise. Indeed, \"[t]he States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised.\" Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., \n360 \nU.S. 45, 50\n. Compare United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651\n. \"In other words, the privilege to vote in a State is within the jurisdiction of the State itself, to be exercised as the State may direct, and upon such terms as to it may seem proper, provided, of course, no discrimination is made between individuals in violation of the Federal Constitution.\" Pope v. Williams, supra, at 632.\n\nThis Texas constitutional provision, however, is unique.\n3\n Texas has said that no serviceman may ever \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n acquire a voting residence in the State so long as he remains in service. It is true that the State has treated all members of the military with an equal hand. And mere classification, as this Court has often said, does not of itself deprive a group of equal protection. Williamson \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483\n. But the fact that a State is dealing with a distinct class and treats the members of that class equally does not end the judicial inquiry. \"The courts must reach and determine the question whether the classifications drawn in a statute are reasonable in light of its purpose. . . .\" McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184, 191\n.\n\nIt is argued that this absolute denial of the vote to servicemen like the petitioner fulfills two purposes. First, the State says it has a legitimate interest in immunizing its elections from the concentrated balloting of military personnel, whose collective voice may overwhelm a small local civilian community. Secondly, the State says it has a valid interest in protecting the franchise from infiltration by transients, and it can reasonably assume that those servicemen who fall within the constitutional exclusion will be within the State for only a short period of time.\n\nThe theory underlying the State's first contention is that the Texas constitutional provision is necessary to prevent the danger of a \"takeover\" of the civilian community resulting from concentrated voting by large numbers of military personnel in bases placed near Texas towns and cities. A base commander, Texas suggests, who opposes local police administration or teaching policies in local schools, might influence his men to vote in conformity with his predilections. Local bond issues may fail, and property taxes stagnate at low levels because military personnel are unwilling to invest in the future of the area. We stress - and this a theme to be reiterated - that Texas has the right to require that all military \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n personnel enrolled to vote be bona fide residents of the community. But if they are in fact residents, with the intention of making Texas their home indefinitely, they, as all other qualified residents, have a right to an equal opportunity for political representation. Cf. Gray v. Sanders, \n372 \nU.S. 368\n. \"Fencing out\" from the franchise a sector of the population because of the way they may vote is constitutionally impermissible. \"[T]he exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions,\" Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, cannot constitutionally be obliterated because of a fear of the political views of a particular group of bona fide residents. Yet, that is what Texas claims to have done here.\n\nThe State's second argument is that its voting ban is justified because of the transient nature of service in the Armed Forces.\n4\n As the Supreme Court of Texas stated: \"Persons in military service are subject at all times to reassignment, and hence to a change in their actual residence . . . they do not elect to be where they are. Their reasons for being where they are . . . cannot be the same as [those of] the permanent residents.\" 378 S. W. 2d, at 306. The Texas Constitution provides that a United States citizen can become a qualified elector if he has \"resided in this State one (1) year next preceding an election and the last six (6) months within the district or county \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n in which such person offers to vote.\" Article VI, 2, Texas Constitution. It is the integrity of this qualification of residence which Texas contends is protected by the voting ban on members of the Armed Forces.\n\nBut only where military personnel are involved has Texas been unwilling to develop more precise tests to determine the bona fides of an individual claiming to have actually made his home in the State long enough to vote. The State's law reports disclose that there have been many cases where the local election officials have determined the issue of bona fide residence. These officials and the courts reviewing their actions have required a \"freely exercised intention\" of remaining within the State, Harrison v. Chesshir, 316 S. W. 2d 909, 915. The declarations of voters concerning their intent to reside in the State and in a particular county is often not conclusive; the election officials may look to the actual facts and circumstances. Stratton v. Hall, 90 S. W. 2d 865, 866. By statute,\n5\n Texas deals with particular categories of citizens who, like soldiers, present specialized problems in determining residence. Students at colleges and universities in Texas, patients in hospitals and other institutions within the State, and civilian employees of the United States Government may be as transient as military personnel. But all of them are given at least an opportunity to show the election officials that they are bona fide residents.\n\nIndeed, Texas has been able, in other areas, to winnow successfully from the ranks of the military those whose residence in the State is bona fide. In divorce cases, for example, the residence requirement for jurisdictional purposes, like the requirement for the vote, is one year in the State and six months in the forum county. The Texas courts have held that merely being stationed within the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 96]\n\u00a0\n State may be insufficient to show residence, even though the statutory period is fulfilled. Even a declared intention to establish a residence may be not enough. \"However, the fact that one is a soldier or sailor does not deprive him of the right to change his residence or domicile and acquire a new one.\" Robinson v. Robinson, 235 S. W. 2d 228, 230.\n\nWe deal here with matters close to the core of our constitutional system. \"The right . . . to choose,\" United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 314\n, that this Court has been so zealous to protect, means, at the least, that States may not casually deprive a class of individuals of the vote because of some remote administrative benefit to the State. Oyama v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 633\n. By forbidding a soldier ever to controvert the presumption of nonresidence, the Texas Constitution imposes an invidious discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \"[T]here is no indication in the Constitution that . . . occupation affords a permissible basis for distinguishing between qualified voters within the State.\" Gray v. Sanders, \n372 \nU.S. 368, 380\n.\n\nWe recognize that special problems may be involved in determining whether servicemen have actually acquired a new domicile in a State for franchise purposes. We emphasize that Texas is free to take reasonable and adequate steps, as have other States,\n6\n to see that all applicants for the vote actually fulfill the requirements of bona fide residence. But this constitutional provision goes beyond such rules. \"[T]he presumption here created is . . . definitely conclusive - incapable of being overcome by proof of the most positive character.\" Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 324\n. All servicemen not residents of Texas before induction come within the provision's sweep. Not one of them can ever vote in Texas, no matter how \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 97]\n\u00a0\n long Texas may have been his true home. \"[T]he uniform of our country . . . [must not] be the badge of disfranchisement for the man or woman who wears it.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Texas Constitution, Art. VI, 2: \"Any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or component branches thereof, or in the military service of the United States, may vote only in the county in which he or she resided at the time \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n of entering such service so long as he or she is a member of the Armed Forces.\" The constitutional provision has been implemented by Article 5.02 of the Election Code of Texas which provides, in part: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or component branches thereof who is on active duty in the military service of the United States may vote only in the county in which he or she resided at the time of entering such service so long as he or she is a member of the Armed Forces. This restriction applies only to members of the Armed Forces who are on active duty, and the phrase `time of entering such service' means the time of commencing the current active duty. A re-enlistment after a temporary separation from service upon termination of a prior enlistment shall not be construed to be the commencement of a new period of service, and in such case the county in which the person resided at the time of commencing active service under the prior enlistment shall be construed to be the county of residence at the time of entering service.\" In Mabry v. Davis, 232 F. Supp. 930 (D.C. W. D. Texas 1964), a three-judge court recently declared this same provision unconstitutional as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The self-evident purpose of the amendment to the Constitution was to prevent a person entering military service as a resident citizen of a county in Texas from acquiring a different voting residence in Texas during the period of his military service, and to prevent a person entering military service as a resident citizen of another state from acquiring a voting residence in Texas during the period of military service.\" 378 S. W. 2d 304, 305. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] While many States have rules which prescribe special tests for qualifying military personnel for the vote, none goes so far as completely \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n to foreclose from the franchise all servicemen who were nonresidents before induction. One other State, Nevada, has a provision which on its face seems as prohibitory as Art. VI, 2, of the Texas Constitution. The Nevada Constitution provides that: \"The right of suffrage shall be enjoyed by all persons, otherwise entitled to the same, who may be in the military or naval service of the United States; provided, the votes so cast shall be made to apply to the county and township of which said voters were bona fide residents at the time of their entry into such service . . . .\" Nev. Const., Art. 2, 3. (Emphasis supplied.) But the Attorney General of Nevada has recently interpreted this provision to mean that servicemen such as petitioner can establish a voting residence in the State if they show their intent to remain by \"clear and unequivocal evidence.\" Op. Atty. Gen. Nev. 194, 197 (1961-1962). Under the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955, 69 Stat. 584, the Department of Defense collects and distributes to military personnel an analysis of state voter qualifications as applied to servicemen. The 1964 report states: \"For voting purposes the legal residence of members of the Armed Forces is generally the State from which they entered military service. This home State remains as the only State in which a person in the Armed Forces has the legal right to vote unless certain conditions are met. Almost all States except Texas will permit persons in the Armed Forces to acquire a new voting residence within their jurisdiction. When this is accomplished, voting rights in the old State of residence are lost.\" Voting Information 1964, Department of Defense, p. x. Constitutional and statutory provisions of other States which treat the military specially, do not absolutely prohibit any opportunity to prove residence. The Georgia Constitution, for example, provides that no member of the Armed Forces \"shall acquire the rights of an elector by reason of being stationed on duty in this State.\" Georgia Const., 2-702; see Indiana Const., Art. 2, 3; Oregon Const., Art. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n II, 5; Alabama Code, Tit. 17, 17. Other States distinguish between servicemen who live on the base, and those who have acquired homes in the community. Cf. Restatement, Conflict of Laws 21, Comment c.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The constitutional provision at issue in this case seems designed more as a rule prohibiting a serviceman from ever acquiring a voting residence than a disqualification from the franchise. Prior to 1954, Art. VI, 1, of the Texas Constitution included among the \"classes of persons . . . not . . . allowed to vote in this State\": \"5. All soldiers, marines and seamen employed in the service of the Army or Navy of the United States.\" This clause was eliminated, according to the annotator's notes, to \"confer the privilege to vote upon members of the regular establishment of the Armed Forces.\" 9 Vernon's Texas Civ. Stat. 19 (1964 Supp.). The 1954 constitutional amendment, involved in this case, was added to the section which establishes residence qualifications for voters.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 9 Vernon's Tex. Civ. Stat. (Election Code) Art. 5.08.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See note 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Message of Governor Ellis Arnall to General Assembly of Georgia, p. 5 (January 3, 1944).\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAnyone not familiar with the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, the history of that Amendment, and the decisions of the Court in this constitutional area, would gather from today's opinion that it is an established constitutional tenet that state laws governing the qualifications of voters are subject to the limitations of the Equal Protection Clause. Yet any dispassionate survey of the past will reveal that the present decision is the first to so hold.\n\nIn making this holding the Court totally ignores, as it did in last Term's reapportionment cases, Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n (and companion cases), all the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and the course of judicial decisions which together plainly show that the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to touch state electoral matters. See my dissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, at 589. If that history does not prove what I think it does, we are at least entitled to be told why. While I cannot express surprise over today's decision after the reapportionment cases, which though bound to follow I continue to believe are constitutionally indefensible, I can and do respectfully, but earnestly, record my protest \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 98]\n\u00a0\n against this further extension of federal judicial power into the political affairs of the States. The reapportionment cases do not require this extension. They were concerned with methods of constituting state legislatures; this case involves state voter qualifications. The Court is quite right in not even citing them.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nI deplore the added impetus which this decision gives to the current tendency of judging constitutional questions \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 99]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of abstract \"justice\" unleashed from the limiting principles that go with our constitutional system. Constitutionally principled adjudication, high in the process of which is due recognition of the just demands of federalism, leaves ample room for the protection of individual rights. A constitutional democracy which in order to cope with seeming needs of the moment is willing to temporize with its basic distribution and limitation of governmental powers will sooner or later find itself in trouble.\n\nFor reasons set forth at length in my dissent in Reynolds, I would dismiss the complaint in this case for failure to state a claim of federal right.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nI also think this decision wrong even on the Court's premise that it is free to extend the Equal Protection Clause so as to reach state-established voter qualifications. The question here is simply whether the differentiation in voting eligibility requirements which Texas has made is founded on a rational classification. In judging this question I think that the dictates of history, even though the Court has seen fit to disregard them for the purpose of determining whether it should get into the matter at all, should cause the Court to take a hard look before striking down a traditional state policy in this area as rationally indefensible.\n\nEssentially the Texas statute establishes a rule that servicemen from other States stationed at Texas bases are to be treated as transients for voting purposes. No one disputes that in the vast majority of cases Texas' view of things accords with fact. Although it is doubtless true that this rule may operate in some instances contrary to the actual facts, I do not think that the Federal Constitution prevents the State from ignoring that possibility in the overall picture. In my opinion Texas \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 100]\n\u00a0\n could rationally conclude that such instances would likely be too minimal to justify the administrative expenditure involved in coping with the \"special problems\" (ante, p. 96) entailed in winnowing out the bona fide permanent residents from among the transient servicemen living off base and sending their children to local schools.\n\nBeyond this, I think a legitimate distinction may be drawn between those who come voluntarily into Texas in connection with private occupations and those ordered into Texas by military authority. Residences established by the latter are subject to the doubt, not present to the same degree with the former, that when the military compulsion ends, so also may the desire to remain in Texas.\n\nAnd finally, I think that Texas, given the traditional American notion that control of the military should always be kept in civilian hands, emphasized in the case of Texas by its own special historical experience,\n2\n could \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 101]\n\u00a0\n rationally decide to protect state and local politics against the influences of military voting strength by, in effect, postponing the privilege of voting otherwise attaching to a service-acquired domicile until the serviceman becomes a civilian and by limiting Texan servicemen to voting in the counties of their original domicile.\n3\n Such a policy on Texas' part may seem to many unduly provincial in light of modern conditions, but it cannot, in my view, be said to be unconstitutional.\n\nThus, whether or not this Court has subject matter jurisdiction in this case, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas should not be disturbed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] None of the cases on which the Court does rely lends any support to its decision. In Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621\n, the Court upheld a Maryland statute which required voters to have been registered in the State for at least a year. The Court said of the right to vote: \"It is not a privilege springing from citizenship of the United States. . . . It may not be refused on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude, but it does not follow from mere citizenship of the United States. In other words, the privilege to vote in a State is within the jurisdiction of the State itself, to be exercised as the State may direct, and upon such terms as to it may seem proper, provided, of course, no discrimination is made between individuals in violation of the Federal Constitution [obviously referring to the Fifteenth and not the Fourteenth Amendment]. . . . The question whether the conditions prescribed by the State might be regarded by others as reasonable or unreasonable is not a Federal one.\" \n193 \nU.S., at 632\n-633. Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., \n360 \nU.S. 45\n, upheld the literacy test applied in North Carolina against an attack made on its face. The Court noted that: \"Of course a literacy test, fair on its face, may be employed to perpetuate that discrimination which the Fifteenth Amendment was designed to uproot.\" \n360 \nU.S., at 53\n. (Emphasis added.) Gray v. Sanders, \n372 \nU.S. 368\n, struck down Georgia's county-unit system for counting votes in a party primary election for the nomination of a United States Senator. It did not deal with voter qualifications. United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n, dealt with stuffing ballot boxes, and Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651\n, with intimidation of Negroes attempting to vote. Neither dealt with voter qualifications. None of the other federal cases cited by the Court was concerned in any way with voting.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The 1837 election law of the Republic of Texas, 9, provided \"That regular enlisted soldiers, and volunteers for during the war, shall not be eligible to vote for civil officers.\" 2 Laws of Republic of Texas, p. 8, in 1 Gammel, Laws of Texas, p. 1350. \"This provision was no doubt inspired by the mutinous conduct of the nonresident volunteers who had been recruited in the United States after the Battle of San Jacinto. They had defied the provisional government and on one occasion in July, 1836, had sent an officer to arrest President David G. Burnett and his cabinet to bring them to trial before the army. They had continued their rebellious conduct after Sam Houston became the first president under the Constitution of 1836. It was not until May, 1837, that Houston was able to dissolve the army and eliminate this threat to civil authority. This provision disfranchising soldiers in the regular army was placed in the 1845 Constitution of the State of Texas and has remained in each succeeding constitution. It was modified in 1932 to exempt the National Guard and reserve and retired officers and men.\" McCall, History of Texas Election Laws, 9 Vernon's Ann. Tex. Civ. Stat., pp. XVII-XVIII (1952). Other States which had similar provisions in their early constitutions included Alabama, Const. of 1819, Art. III, 5; Arkansas, Const. of 1836, Art. IV, 2; Indiana, Const. of 1816, Art. VI, 1: Louisiana, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 89, 101]\n\u00a0\n Const. of 1845, Art. 12; Missouri, Const. of 1820, Art. III, 10; South Carolina, Const. of 1790 (as amended in 1810), Art.

Meyer, Attorney General.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nPetitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, alleging that he was unconstitutionally denied the assistance of counsel when he entered a plea of guilty in that court to a charge of burglary. The trial court dismissed the petition without a hearing, and filed no opinion. The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed. 177 Neb. 404, 129 N. W. 2d 107. The Supreme Court's opinion recognized that petitioner's allegations, if true, would establish a violation of the Federal Constitution. 177 Neb., at 410, 129 N. W. 2d, at 111. The Supreme Court held, however, that, in Nebraska, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 337]\n\u00a0\n \"Habeas corpus is not available to discharge a prisoner from a sentence of penal servitude if the court imposing it had jurisdiction of the offense and of the person charged with the crime, and the sentence was within the power of the court.\" 177 Neb., at 412, 129 N. W. 2d, at 112. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 958\n, to decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the States afford state prisoners some adequate corrective process for the hearing and determination of claims of violation of federal constitutional guarantees.\n\nAfter certiorari was granted, the Nebraska Legislature enacted a statute providing a postconviction procedure. Neb. Leg. Bill 836, Seventy-fifth Session, effective April 12, 1965. On its face, the statute provides for a hearing of petitions such as this one, alleging denial of federal constitutional rights. Therefore, the judgment is vacated and the cause remanded to the Nebraska Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of the supervening statute.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK, concurring.\n\nAs the Court points out, we granted certiorari in this case \"to decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the States afford state prisoners some adequate corrective process for the hearing and determination of claims of violation of federal constitutional guarantees.\" Happily, Nebraska in the interim has adopted just such a procedure thus obviating the necessity of our passing upon the question.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that as early as 1949 this Court in Young v. Ragen, \n337 \nU.S. 235\n, articulated the principle that the States must afford prisoners some \"clearly defined method by which they may raise claims of denial of federal rights.\" Id., at 239. But compare Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n (1935). In stating \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 338]\n\u00a0\n that proposition the Court noted: \"The doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies, to which this Court has required the scrupulous adherence of all federal courts . . . presupposes that some adequate state remedy exists. We recognize the difficulties with which the Illinois Supreme Court is faced in adapting available state procedures to [this] requirement . . . . Nevertheless, that requirement must be met.\" Young v. Ragen, supra, at 238-239.\n\nThereafter, the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act was adopted.\n1\n It was followed by passage of a statute in North Carolina in 1951 which was \"modeled\" on the Illinois Act.\n2\n Miller v. State, 237 N.C. 29, 51, 74 S. E. 2d 513, 528 (1953). Nebraska is the seventh State to adopt such a statute since Young v. Ragen, supra.\n3\n There exists in some States a wide variety of procedural techniques that have been used to deal with due process attacks on criminal convictions, i. e., basic common-law remedies such as habeas corpus, coram nobis and delayed motions for new trial. But the great variations in the scope and availability of such remedies result in their being entirely inadequate.\n\nAs a consequence there has been a tremendous increase in habeas corpus applications in federal courts. Indeed, in the Supreme Court alone they have increased threefold in the last 15 years. This has brought about much public \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 339]\n\u00a0\n agitation and debate over proposed limitations of the habeas corpus jurisdiction of federal courts. The necessity for such proposals has been based on various grounds, including that of federal-state comity; inordinate delay in the administration of criminal justice in the state courts; and the heavy burden on the federal judiciary. None of these will survive careful scrutiny.\n\nStrangely enough there has been little light thrown on the necessity for more effective postconviction remedies in the States. In 1958 the Burton Committee\n4\n reported out a preliminary draft of findings in which it stated\n\n\"that the law of state post-conviction process in many states was wholly inadequate to cope with the demands now being placed upon it. In some jurisdictions prisoners were altogether precluded from direct access to the courts. [Cochran v. Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255\n (1942); Dowd v. Cook, \n340 \nU.S. 206\n (1951).] . . . In many more, the procedures recognized by state law failed to provide genuine opportunities for testing constitutional issues of the most numerous and important types. The result was that prisoners often failed to obtain hearings on their allegations in the state courts. This, in turn, increased the number of petitions in state and federal courts and was generally productive of frustrations in all persons concerned with the process.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n Believing that the practical answer to the problem is the enactment by the several States of postconviction \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 340]\n\u00a0\n remedy statutes I applaud the action of Nebraska. This will enable prisoners to \"air out\" their claims in the state courts and will stop the rising conflict presently being generated between federal and state courts. This has proven true in Illinois where it is reported that federal applications from state prisoners dropped considerably after its Act was adopted. I understand that the Illinois Legislature is now considering the enlargement of the five-year limitations period of its present Act to a 20-year period. The consensus is that this will solve the problem entirely in Illinois, which was originally the \"sore spot\" of the Nation in this regard.\n\nI hope that the various States will follow the lead of Illinois, Nebraska, Maryland, North Carolina, Maine, Oregon and Wyoming in providing this modern procedure for testing federal claims in the state courts and thus relieve the federal courts of this ever-increasing burden.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ill.

In August 1958 it circulated a preliminary draft of a study entitled Effective State Post-Conviction Procedures - Their Nature and Essentialities, which was prepared by the Seminar in Criminal Procedure of the University of Chicago Law School under the direction of Professor Francis A. Allen.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id., at 2-3.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.\n\nThe petitioner entered his plea of guilty on April 18, 1963, one month after this Court's decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n, holding the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel applicable to state prosecutions by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n1\n The Nebraska \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 341]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court followed prior Nebraska decisions in holding that, in a habeas corpus action brought by a convicted prisoner, judicial inquiry is limited to the jurisdiction of the convicting court over the offense and over the person of the accused, and to the question whether the sentence imposed was within the power of the court.\n2\n The State conceded in its response to the petition for certiorari that habeas corpus was unavailable to hear petitioner's claim and that petitioner had no other remedy in the state courts.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nOn oral argument, counsel appointed for petitioner, see \n379 \nU.S. 995\n, conceded the relevancy of the new Nebraska postconviction procedure,\n4\n but contended that petitioner \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n was nevertheless entitled to a declaration that he had been unconstitutionally denied a hearing by the Nebraska courts, and to a reversal of the judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court and a mandate directing that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n by some procedure the petitioner's claim be adequately adjudicated.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner concedes that the Court's practice has been to remit prisoners to their federal habeas corpus remedy. See, e. g., Jennings v. Illinois, \n342 \nU.S. 104\n. But he contends \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n that substituting federal for state corrective process, instead of directing the State itself to meet its obligation, is a disservice to sound principles of federalism.\n6\n He points to the vast increase in the number of federal habeas corpus applications by state prisoners as evidence that lack of adequate state procedures has put an intolerable strain on the federal writ and has brought about mounting friction between state and federal courts. See Henry v. Mississippi, \n379 \nU.S. 443, 453\n. In short, he contends that if the evolution in the coverage of the Fourteenth Amendment and in the scope of federal habeas corpus, see Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391\n, is not to pull the federal judiciary increasingly into state criminal administration, the States must provide broader procedures more hospitable to federal constitutional claims.\n\nThe desirability of minimizing the necessity for resort by state prisoners to federal habeas corpus is not to be denied. Our federal system entrusts the States with primary responsibility for the administration of their criminal laws. The Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause make requirements of fair and just procedures an integral part of those laws, and state procedures should ideally include adequate administration of these guarantees as well.\n7\n If, by effective corrective processes, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 345]\n\u00a0\n the States assumed this burden, the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. 2254 (1958 ed.) would clearly promote state primacy in the implementation of these guarantees. Of greater importance, it would assure not only that meritorious claims would generally be vindicated without any need for federal court intervention, but that nonmeritorious claims would be fully ventilated, making easier the task of the federal judge if the state prisoner pursued his cause further. See Townsend v. Sain, \n372 \nU.S. 293, 312\n-318. Greater finality would inevitably attach to state court determinations of federal constitutional questions, because further evidentiary hearings on federal habeas corpus would, if the conditions of Townsend v. Sain were met, prove unnecessary.\n\nNone can view with satisfaction the channeling of a large part of state criminal business to federal trial courts. If adequate state procedures, presently all too scarce,\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 346]\n\u00a0\n were generally adopted, much would be done to remove the irritant of participation by the federal district courts in state criminal procedure. The 1954 Report of the Special Committee on Habeas Corpus of the Conference of Chief Justices pointed the way in urging that \"State statutes should provide a postconviction process at least as broad in scope as existing Federal statutes under which claims of violation of constitutional right asserted by State prisoners are determined in Federal courts under the Federal habeas corpus statutes,\" and recommending provisions for hearing, a record, fact findings and conclusions of law. H. R. Rep. No. 1293, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7 et seq.\n\nThese are similar to other suggestions of desirable attributes of a state postconviction procedure which should reduce the necessity for exercise of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction.\n9\n The procedure should be swift and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 347]\n\u00a0\n simple and easily invoked. It should be sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all federal constitutional claims. In light of Fay v. Noia, supra, it should eschew rigid and technical doctrines of forfeiture, waiver, or default. See Douglas v. Alabama, \n380 \nU.S. 415, 422\n-423; Henry v. Mississippi, supra. It should provide for full fact hearings to resolve disputed factual issues, and for compilation of a record to enable federal courts to determine the sufficiency of those hearings. Townsend v. Sain, supra. It should provide for decisions supported by opinions, or fact findings and conclusions of law, which disclose the grounds of decision and the resolution of disputed facts. Provision for counsel to represent prisoners, as in 4 of the Nebraska Act, would enhance the probability of effective presentation and a proper disposition of prisoners' claims.\n\nBut there is no occasion in this case to decide whether due process requires the States to provide corrective process. The new statute on its face is plainly an adequate corrective process. Every consideration of federalism supports our conclusion to afford the Nebraska courts the opportunity to say whether that process is available for the hearing and determination of petitioner's claim.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition for habeas corpus reads:\n\n\"Petitioner, Paul Vernon CASE, was sentenced to five (5) years in the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex on May 3, 1963, A. D.\n\n\n\"Petitioner was `fast talked' and forcibly coerced into waiving his rights (U.S. Constitutional Rights) to have advice and counsel; to have a Preliminary Hearing, and to plead not-guilty.\n\n\n\"Mr. William D. Blue told Petitioner he, Petitioner, would be charged with being `An Habitual Criminal' if he did not waive these rights. He, Petitioner was held in Solitary Confinement in City Jail, until such time as he would agree - under cruel and unusual circumstances.\n\n\n\"The basic rights waived by this Petitioner are guaranteed him under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and are so \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 341]\n\u00a0\n fundamental and essential to a fair trial that they are made obligatory upon the States, All states, by way of the Fourteenth Amendment. For reference see Gideon vs. Wainwright in the U.S. Supreme Court. October 1962, Term, No. 155; all Justices concurring.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Jackson v. Olson, 146 Neb. 885, 893-894, 22 N. W. 2d 124, 129-130; In re Dunn, 150 Neb. 669, 35 N. W. 2d 673; Hawk v. Olson, 145 Neb. 306, 16 N. W. 2d 181, rev'd \n326 \nU.S. 271\n, on remand, 146 Neb. 875, 22 N. W. 2d 136.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The response stated: \"For all practical purposes, there is no collateral remedy available in the Nebraska courts to a state prisoner who alleges that a violation of his federal constitutional rights occurred in connection with his conviction and whose claim has not yet been considered by the state courts, unless the prisoner's claim is predicated upon a lack of jurisdiction of the sentencing court over the offense or over the person of the accused.\"\n\nIn addition to this concession that the State provided no remedy whatever, petitioner cites Carlsen v. State, 129 Neb. 84, 261 N. W. 339, as authority for the unavailability of coram nobis; Neb. Rev. Stat. 29-2103 (1964 Reissue), as barring a motion for a new trial; and Neb. Rev. Stat. 25-1912 (1964 Reissue), as barring an appeal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The new statute, Neb. Leg. Bill 836, 75th Session, effective April 12, 1965, provides:\n\n\"Sec. 1. A prisoner in custody under sentence and claiming a right to be released on the ground that there was such a denial or infringement of the rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Constitution of this state or the Constitution \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, may file a verified motion at any time in the court which imposed such sentence, stating the grounds relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the sentence.\n\n\n\"Unless the motion and the files and records of the case show to the satisfaction of the court that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the county attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that there was such a denial or infringement of the rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States, the court shall vacate and set aside the judgment and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial as may appear appropriate. Proceedings under the provisions of this act shall be civil in nature. Costs shall be taxed as in habeas corpus cases.\n\n\n\"A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner, whether or not a hearing is held. Testimony of the prisoner or other witnesses may be offered by deposition. The court need not entertain a second motion or successive motions for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\n\n\n\"Sec. 2. An order sustaining or overruling a motion filed under the provisions of this act shall be deemed to be a final judgment, and an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court therefrom as provided for in appeals in civil cases; Provided, that a prisoner may in the discretion of the Supreme Court upon application to the court be released on such recognizance as the Supreme Court shall fix pending the determination of the appeal.\n\n\n\"Sec. 3. The remedy provided by this act is cumulative and is not intended to be concurrent with any other remedy existing in the courts of this state. Any proceeding filed under the provisions of this act which states facts which if true would constitute grounds for relief under another remedy shall be dismissed without prejudice.\n\n\n\"Sec. 4. The district court may appoint an attorney or attorneys, not exceeding two, to represent the prisoners in all proceedings under the provisions of this act and fix their compensation as provided in section 29-1803, Reissue Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1943.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The petitioner states in his brief:\n\n\"At this stage of the litigation the Court need not pass on the steps to be taken if the Nebraska court should fail to comply with a mandate requiring corrective process for petitioner. It might be suggested, however, that the problem essentially is no different from actual or potential disobedience of the mandate in many other cases remanded by this Court. If on the remand Nebraska failed to make corrective process available, petitioner could return here with a fresh petition for certiorari. This Court could then order petitioner's discharge from custody. That is the ultimate sanction behind the due process requirement of state corrective process. See Dowd v. Cook, \n340 \nU.S. 206, 209\n-10.\"\n\n\n In support of this contention, the petitioner argues that the Supremacy Clause and the fundamental Fourteenth Amendment right to a hearing constitutionally require the States to afford corrective judicial process to remedy federal constitutional defects in their criminal prosecutions, citing Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 335\n; Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 91\n; Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103, 113\n; New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, \n318 \nU.S. 688, 690\n; Carter v. Illinois, \n329 \nU.S. 173, 175\n-176; Foster v. Illinois, \n332 \nU.S. 134, 139\n; Taylor v. Alabama, \n335 \nU.S. 252, 272\n (concurring opinion); Young v. Ragen, \n337 \nU.S. 235, 238\n-239. In addition to the cases cited involving criminal convictions, petitioner cites as other applications of the general principle General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211, 228\n; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n; Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17\n; McKnett v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 230\n; Testa v. Katt, \n330 \nU.S. 386\n. He also argues that, since Nebraska allowed habeas corpus to attack convictions for jurisdictional defects based on Nebraska law, the Nebraska Supreme Court unconstitutionally discriminated against federal law by refusing habeas corpus for jurisdictional defects based on the Fourteenth Amendment. For the proposition that a State may not discriminate against rights arising under federal laws, petitioner cites McKnett v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., supra, and Testa v. Katt, supra, and for the proposition that an unconstitutional denial of counsel is a jurisdictional defect relies on Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Petitioner refers to Young v. Ragen, supra, where, in vacating the denial of state habeas corpus, the Court said: \"If there is now no post-trial procedure by which federal rights may be vindicated in Illinois, we wish to be advised of that fact upon remand of this case.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 239\n. He also cites Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368\n; Boles v. Stevenson, \n379 \nU.S. 43\n; Henry v. Mississippi, \n379 \nU.S. 443\n; and Note, Effect of the Federal Constitution in Requiring State Post-Conviction Remedies, 53 Col. L. Rev. 1143 (1953).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Dean Griswold of the Harvard Law School, in an address, \"The States and Criminal Law,\" given on May 13, 1965, to the Cleveland Bar Association, said:\n\n\"For, after all, the basic responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law remains with the States. The States are, or should be, as much concerned with high standards as is the Federal government. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 336, 345]\n\u00a0\n The States should, in my view, welcome the determinations of the Supreme Court that the high standards prescribed by our Federal Constitution are to be taken seriously and should be enforced. What is needed now is for the States to accept this responsibility, and to adopt means to carry it out. With proper explanation and understanding, this can, I believe, be done without impairing our enforcement of the criminal law. When the States do fully meet this responsibility, we will all be better off, and we will more nearly have realized the potentialities of our Great Federal form of Government.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, 9B Uniform Laws Ann. 352-359, designed to provide adjudication of federal claims, has had but slight influence in the States. Arkansas adopted the Uniform Act in 1957, but repealed it two years later. 2 Acts of Arkansas (1959) 1160-1161. Six States in addition to Nebraska have adopted their own statutes. Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 38, 122-1 to 122-7 (1963); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., c. 126, 1-A to 1-G (Supp. 1963); Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, 645A to 645J (Supp. 1964); N.C. Gen. Stat. 15-217 to 15-222 (Supp. 1963); Ore. Rev. Stat. 138.510-138.680 (1963); Wyo. Stat. Ann. 7-408.1 to 7-408.8 (1963 Cum. Supp.). Procedures have been adopted by rule of court in six States. Alaska Sup. Ct. Rule 35 (b); Del. Super. Ct. Crim.

Some state courts are apparently broadening existing post-conviction remedies by judicial construction. See, e. g., People v. Huntley, 15 N. Y. 2d 72, 204 N. E. 2d 179 (1965); State ex rel. Banach v. Boles, 147 W. Va. 850, 858, 131 S. E. 2d 722, 728 (1963); Hunt v. Warden, 335 F.2d 936, 941-942 (C. A. 4th Cir.) (discussing the expanding Maryland remedy). See also the views expressed in People v.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nAn examination of the proceedings in this case convinces us that a summary disposition of this matter is not appropriate.\n\nIn 1955 the Government brought an antitrust action against appellant Columbia, appellant Community Concerts. Inc. (Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary), and two corporations whose successor is appellee Summy-Birchard, Inc.\n*\n Columbia and Summy-Birchard manage professional concert artists, and their affiliates, Community and the Civic Concert Service division of Summy-Birchard, are \"concert services,\" organizing and maintaining \n\n[381 \nU.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n local nonprofit \"audience associations\" throughout the country which sponsor concert series. Normally an audience association pays an artist an established fee set by the artist and his manager, out of which the artist's manager retains a share and the concert service also retains a share known as the \"margin.\" The Government's complaint charged a conspiracy to monopolize the business of managing and booking concert artists and the business of forming and maintaining audience associations.\n\nOn October 20, 1955, a consent decree was entered by the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the terms of which provide that the managing companies must make their artists available to all concert services at the same rate and that the concert services must make performers available to audience associations without reference to the management of the artists. Paragraph VI (D) of the decree requires that each defendant make available \"to any financially responsible concert service any artist managed by such defendant and reasonably available for the desired performance, at the same margin allowed to the defendant or its affiliate concert service by that artist for a performance for the same fee.\"\n\nColumbia's standard contract with concert services contains a provision, which Columbia argues is required by a collective bargaining agreement among managers and the concert artists' union, prohibiting a concert service from booking an engagement at less than the artist's established fee without the consent of the artist. After Summy-Birchard protested against signing contracts containing this provision on the ground that it constituted illegal resale price maintenance, Columbia petitioned the District Court on July 18, 1963, for a construction of the 1955 consent decree, alleging in part that the decree specifically sanctioned this contract provision and thus insulated it from attack by a party to the decree. The Government and Summy-Birchard were joined as parties. The \n\n[381 \nU.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n District Court held that this contract provision prevented competition among concert services, for it required all of them to be paid the same \"margin\" for each artist, and concluded that such a provision was illegal. After re-argument, the District Court reaffirmed its prior opinion and stated in its final order:\n\n\"The provision in Columbia's contract . . . that each engagement before an audience association shall be performed at the artist's established fee constitutes illegal resale price maintenance and is a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1). To the extent that the Final Judgment operates to allow Columbia to set such resale prices, it is illegal and void as contrary to the Sherman Act. and any continued reliance by Columbia upon such portion or portions of the Final Judgment will not be construed by the Court to be in any way valid.\"\n\n\n Columbia appeals from this judgment claiming that it constitutes a modification of the 1955 consent decree and that the District Court is without power to modify the decree without Columbia's agreement.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn our view there is substance to Columbia's contention that the District Court modified the 1955 consent decree. As we read the District Court's opinion, that court held that the 1955 decree affirmatively sanctioned the use of the contract provision, and then went on to modify the decree, invalidating that portion of the decree which permitted Columbia to include the provision at issue in its contracts. The District Judge stated in his original opinion:\n\n \"The scheme of the concert service business conducted by Community and the Civic division of Summy-Birchard which is embodied in the decree \n\n[381 \nU.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n clearly envisions that the artist or his manager will be able to control the ultimate price paid by the `consumer'  - audience association, impresario, or whoever assumes the risk of `producing' a show. Were this not so, the definition of `margin' in the decree would be meaningless. Since this court by its decree  - albeit a consent order - has sanctioned pro tanto this structuring of the industry, it should not be slow to consider charges of illegality against the system.\"\n\n\n The District Judge suggested that Summy-Birchard's answer might be treated as a \"petition for declaratory judgment\" or a \"petition for modification.\" After discussing whether or not the contract provision constituted resale price maintenance, he concluded by stating:\n\n \"Thus, insofar as the decree-imposed requirement of margin operates to allow Columbia to set resale prices, the decree is illegal and void as contrary to the letter and policy of the Sherman Act, and this court will not construe Columbia's continued reliance upon that portion of the decree to be in any way valid.\"\n\n\n The District Judge characterized what he had done as \"[i]nvalidation of . . . part of the consent decree.\" The District Court's opinion on rehearing states, \"The opinion of November 19 is accordingly reaffirmed,\" and the judgment of the District Court, set out above, states that \"[t]o the extent that the Final Judgment operates to allow Columbia to set such resale prices, it is illegal and void as contrary to the Sherman Act.\" In our view the language of the opinion and judgment of the District Court conclusively shows that the court modified the 1955 consent decree despite Columbia's opposition to such modification.\n\nWe believe that the modification of a previously entered consent decree under the circumstances present here raises \n\n[381 \nU.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n substantial questions of law. This Court has held that a consent decree ordinarily may not be modified without the consent of the parties involved. In United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106\n,119, Mr. Justice Cardozo stated for the Court: \"Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned.\" See United States v. International Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693\n; Ford Motor Co. v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 303\n. While the Court has allowed modifications in consent decrees upon occasion, see Chrysler Corp. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 556\n; cf. Hughes v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 353\n, a showing of changed circumstances is usually necessary. Whether a modification of the consent decree was proper in this case, where no changed circumstances were claimed, should not be determined by this Court summarily. Additionally, the District Court's determination that Columbia's contract provision constitutes resale price maintenance prohibited by the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209. raises substantial issues of antitrust law which we believe also ought to be briefed and argued.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nApart from what has already been said, there is another reason why this case should not be dealt with summarily. If the District Court's action is not viewed as a modification of the decree, but rather as a determination that the decree neither specifically sanctioned nor prohibited Columbia's contract provision, the court's judgment must be viewed as a declaratory judgment that Columbia's conduct violated the Sherman Act. In that event no appeal lies to this Court, for the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended. 15 U.S.C. 29, allows direct appeals to this Court only in civil actions \"wherein the United States is complainant.\" If appellant is appealing from a declaratory \n\n[381 \nU.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n judgment, this case should be transferred to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. If the Court is holding by its action that the case is properly here because of the fact that the 1955 action was commenced by the Government, then the case raises substantial questions as to the scope of the Expediting Act which should be resolved only after plenary consideration. See Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting, Inc. v. ASCAP, \n375 \nU.S. 39\n.\n\nWe would therefore \"postpone jurisdiction\" and set the case for argument.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Summy-Birchard is successor to both the National Concert and Artists Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Civic Concert Services, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER v. BROWN(1965)\nNo. 63\nArgued: March 3, 1965Decided: April 27, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent Brown, members of his family and three others, who owned substantially all the stock of a lumber milling company, of which Brown was president, sold their stock to a tax-exempt charitable organization (Institute) for $1,300,000. Institute paid $5,000 down from the company's assets. Concomitantly with the transfer, Institute liquidated the company and leased its assets for five years to a new corporation (Fortuna), formed and wholly owned by respondent's attorneys, which agreed to pay Institute 80% of the operating profits before taxes and depreciation, Institute to apply 90% of such payments (amounting to 72% of the net profits of the business) to a $1,300,000 noninterest-bearing note Institute gave the respondents which was secured by mortgages and assignments of the assets leased to Fortuna. The entire balance of the note was payable if payments thereon failed to total $250,000 over any consecutive two years. The foregoing transaction, consummated in February 1953, was effected pursuant to agreement between respondents, Institute, and other interested parties. Fortuna operated the business with practically the same personnel (including Brown as general manager up to his resignation over a year and a half later) until 1957, when Fortuna's operations ended with a severe decline in the lumber market. Respondents did not repossess under their mortgages but agreed that the properties be sold, with Institute receiving 10% of the $300,000 proceeds and the respondents the balance. In their federal income tax returns respondents showed the payments remitted to them out of the profits of the business as capital gains. Petitioner asserted that such payments were taxable as ordinary income under the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Court upheld respondents' position, concluding that the transfer to the Institute of respondents' stock was a bona fide sale. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n\nHeld:\n\n 1. The transaction constituted a bona fide sale under local law, the Institute having acquired title to the company stock and, by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n liquidation, to all the assets in return for its promise to pay over money from the operating profits. P. 569.\n\n\n 2. The transaction also constituted a sale within the meaning of 1222 (3) of the Internal Revenue Code defining a capital gain as gain from the sale of a capital asset. Pp. 570-573.\n\n\n  (a) The fact that payment was made from business earnings did not divest the transaction of its status as a sale, which is a transfer of property for a fixed monetary price or its equivalent. Pp. 570-572.\n\n\n  (b) The sales price in the arm's-length transaction between respondents and the Institute, as the Tax Court found, was within a reasonable range in light of the company's earnings history and the adjusted net worth of its assets. P. 572.\n\n\n  (c) There had been an appreciation in value of the company's property accruing over a period of years which respondents could have realized at capital gains rates on a cash sale of their stock. Pp. 572-573.\n\n\n 3. It does not follow from the fact that there was no risk-shifting from seller to buyer that the transaction constituted not a sale but a device to collect future earnings at capital gains rates for which the price set was excessive. Pp. 573-577.\n\n\n (a) The Tax Court did not find the price excessive. P. 573.\n\n\n (b) The petitioner offered no evidence to show that an excessive price resulted from the lack of risk-shifting. Pp. 573-574.\n\n\n (c) Accelerated payment of the purchase price resulted from the deductibility of the rents payable by Fortuna which were not taxable to the Institute, thus constituting an advantage to the seller desiring the balance of the purchase price paid off rapidly. P. 574.\n\n\n (d) Risk-shifting has not previously been deemed essential to the concept of sale for tax purposes. Pp. 574-575.\n\n\n (e) The transaction here is not analogous to case involving a transfer of mineral deposits in exchange for a royalty from the minerals produced, the mineral-extracting business being viewed as an income-producing operation and not as a conversion of capital investment.

The Treasury Department itself has noted the availability of capital gains treatment on the sale of capital assets where the seller \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n retained an interest in the income produced by the assets.

Brown.\n\nWilliam H. Kinsey argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were James R. Moore, James A. Larpenteur, Jr., and Robert T. Mautz.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging affirmance, were filed by Arthur A. Armstrong for West Los Angeles Institute for Cancer Research. and by Dana Latham, John H. Hall, Joseph D. Peeler and John E. Scheifly.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1950, when Congress addressed itself to the problem of the direct or indirect acquisition and operation of going businesses by charities or other tax-exempt entities, it was recognized that in many of the typical sale and lease-back transactions, the exempt organization was trading on and perhaps selling part of its exemption. H. R. Rep. No. 2319, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 38-39; S. Rep. No. 2375, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 31-32. For this and other reasons the Internal Revenue Code was accordingly amended in several respects, of principal importance for our purposes by taxing as \"unrelated business income\" the profits earned by a charity in the operation of a business, as well as the income from long-term leases of the business.\n1\n The short-term lease, however, of five years or \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n less, was not affected and this fact has moulded many of the transactions in this field since that time, including the one involved in this case.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commissioner, however, in 1954, announced that when an exempt organization purchased a business and leased it for five years to another corporation, not investing its own funds but paying off the purchase price with rental income, the purchasing organization was in danger of losing its exemption; that in any event the rental income would be taxable income; that the charity might be unreasonably accumulating income; and finally, and most important for this case, that the payments received by the seller would not be entitled to capital gains treatment. Rev. Rul. 54-420. 1954-2 Cum. Bull. 128.\n\nThis case is one of the many in the course of which the Commissioner has questioned the sale of a business concern to an exempt organization.\n3\n The basic facts are undisputed. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n Clay Brown, members of his family and three other persons owned substantially all of the stock in Clay Brown & Company, with sawmills and lumber interests near Fortuna, California. Clay Brown, the president of the company and spokesman for the group. was approached by a representative of California Institute for Cancer Research in 1952. and after considerable negotiation the stockholders agreed to sell their stock to the Institute for $1,300,000, payable $5,000 down from the assets of the company and the balance within 10 years from the earnings of the company's assets. It was provided that simultaneously with the transfer of the stock, the Institute would liquidate the company and lease its assets for five years to a new corporation, Fortuna Sawmills, Inc., formed and wholly owned by the attorneys for the sellers.\n4\n Fortuna would pay to the Institute 80% of its operating profit without allowance for depreciation or taxes, and 90% of such payments would be paid over by the Institute to the selling stockholders to apply on the $1,300,000 note. This note was noninterest bearing, the Institute had no obligation to pay it except from the rental income and it was secured by mortgages and assignments of the assets transferred or leased to Fortuna. If the payments on the note failed to total $250,000 over any two consecutive years, the sellers could declare the entire balance of the note due and payable. The sellers were neither stockholders nor directors of Fortuna but it was provided that Clay Brown was to have a management contract \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n with Fortuna at an annual salary and the right to name any successor manager if he himself resigned.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe transaction was closed on February 4, 1953. Fortuna immediately took over operations of the business under its lease, on the same premises and with practically the same personnel which had been employed by Clay Brown & Company. Effective October 31, 1954, Clay Brown resigned as general manager of Fortuna and waived his right to name his successor. In 1957, because of a rapidly declining lumber market, Fortuna suffered severe reverses and its operations were terminated. Respondent sellers did not repossess the properties under their mortgages but agreed they should be sold by the Institute with the latter retaining 10% of the proceeds. Accordingly, the property was sold by the Institute for $300,000. The payments on the note from rentals and from the sale of the properties totaled $936,131.85. Respondents returned the payments received from rentals as the gain from the sale of capital assets. The Commissioner, however, asserted the payments were taxable as ordinary income and were not capital gain within the meaning of I. R. C. 1939, 117 (a) (4) and I. R. C. 1954, 1222 (3). These sections provide that \"[t]he term `long-term capital gain' means gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months . . . .\"\n\nIn the Tax Court, the Commissioner asserted that the transaction was a sham and that in any event respondents retained such an economic interest in and control over the property sold that the transaction could not be treated as a sale resulting in a long-term capital gain. A divided Tax Court, 37 T. C. 461, found that there had \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n been considerable good-faith bargaining at arm's length between the Brown family and the Institute, that the price agreed upon was within a reasonable range in the light of the earnings history of the corporation and the adjusted net worth of its assets, that the primary motivation for the Institute was the prospect of ending up with the assets of the business free and clear after the purchase price had been fully paid, which would then permit the Institute to convert the property and the money for use in cancer research. and that there had been a real change of economic benefit in the transaction.\n6\n Its conclusion was that the transfer of respondents' stock in Clay Brown & Company to the Institute was a bona fide sale arrived at in an arm's-length transaction and that the amounts received by respondents were proceeds from the sale of stock and entitled to long-term capital gains treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 325 F.2d 313, and we granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 962\n.\n\nHaving abandoned in the Court of Appeals the argument that this transaction was a sham, the Commissioner now admits that there was real substance in what occurred between the Institute and the Brown family. The transaction was a sale under local law. The Institute acquired title to the stock of Clay Brown & Company and, by liquidation, to all of the assets of that company, in return for its promise to pay over money from the operating profits of the company. If the stipulated price was paid, the Brown family would forever lose all rights to the income and properties of the company. Prior to the transfer, these respondents had access to all of the income of the company; after the transfer, 28% of the income remained with Fortuna and the Institute. Respondents \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n had no interest in the Institute nor were they stockholders or directors of the operating company. Any rights to control the management were limited to the management contract between Clay Brown and Fortuna, which was relinquished in 1954.\n\nWhatever substance the transaction might have had, however, the Commissioner claims that it did not have the substance of a sale within the meaning of 1222 (3). His argument is that since the Institute invested nothing, assumed no independent liability for the purchase price and promised only to pay over a percentage of the earnings of the company, the entire risk of the transaction remained on the sellers. Apparently, to qualify as a sale, a transfer of property for money or the promise of money must be to a financially responsible buyer who undertakes to pay the purchase price other than from the earnings or the assets themselves or there must be a substantial down payment which shifts at least part of the risk to the buyer and furnishes some cushion against loss to the seller.\n\nTo say that there is no sale because there is no risk-shifting and that there is no risk-shifting because the price to be paid is payable only from the income produced by the business sold, is very little different from saying that because business earnings are usually taxable as ordinary income, they are subject to the same tax when paid over as the purchase price of property. This argument has rationality but it places an unwarranted construction on the term \"sale,\" is contrary to the policy of the capital gains provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and has no support in the cases. We reject it.\n\n\"Capital gain\" and \"capital asset\" are creatures of the tax law and the Court has been inclined to give these terms a narrow, rather than a broad, construction. Corn Products Co. v. Commissioner, \n350 \nU.S. 46, 52\n. A \"sale,\" however, is a common event in the non-tax world; and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n since it is used in the Code without limiting definition and without legislative history indicating a contrary result, its common and ordinary meaning should at least be persuasive of its meaning as used in the Internal Revenue Code. \"Generally speaking, the language in the Revenue Act. just as in any statute, is to be given its ordinary meaning, and the words `sale' and `exchange' are not to be read any differently.\" Helvering v. Flaccus Leather Co., \n313 \nU.S. 247, 249\n; Hanover Bank v. Commissioner, \n369 \nU.S. 672, 687\n; Commissioner v. Korell, \n339 \nU.S. 619, 627\n-628; Crane v. Commissioner, \n331 \nU.S. 1, 6\n; Lang v. Commissioner, \n289 \nU.S. 109, 111\n; Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n.\n\n\n\"A sale, in the ordinary sense of the word, is a transfer of property for a fixed price in money or its equivalent.\" Iowa v. McFarland, \n110 \nU.S. 471, 478\n; it is a contract \"to pass rights of property for money, - which the buyer pays or promises to pay to the seller . . .,\" Williamson v. Berry, 8 How. 495, 544. Compare the definition of \"sale\" in 1 (2) of the Uniform Sales Act and in 2-106 (1) of the Uniform Commercial Code. The transaction which occurred in this case was obviously a transfer of property for a fixed price payable in money.\n\n\n Unquestionably the courts, in interpreting a statute, have some \"scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning would lead to absurd results . . . or would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute.\" Helvering v. Hammel, \n311 \nU.S. 504, 510\n-511; cf. Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Co., \n364 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, and Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 260, 265\n. But it is otherwise \"where no such consequences would follow and where . . . it appears to be consonant with the purposes of the Act . . . .\" Helvering v. Hammel, supra, at 511; Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 194\n. We find nothing in this case indicating that the Tax Court or the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals construed the term \"sale\" too broadly or in a manner contrary to the purpose or policy of capital gains provisions of the Code.\n\nCongress intended to afford capital gains treatment only in situations \"typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time, and thus to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.\" Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Co., \n364 \nU.S. 130, 134\n. It was to \"relieve the taxpayer from . . . excessive tax burdens on gains resulting from a conversion of capital investments\" that capital gains were taxed differently by Congress. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 106\n; Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 260, 265\n.\n\nAs of January 31, 1953, the adjusted net worth of Clay Brown & Company as revealed by its books was $619,457.63. This figure included accumulated earnings of $448,471.63, paid in surplus, capital stock and notes payable to the Brown family. The appraised value as of that date, however, relied upon by the Institute and the sellers, was $1,064,877, without figuring interest on deferred balances. Under a deferred payment plan with a 6% interest figure, the sale value was placed at $1,301,989. The Tax Court found the sale price agreed upon was arrived at in an arm's-length transaction, was the result of real negotiating and was \"within a reasonable range in light of the earnings history of the corporation and the adjusted net worth of the corporate assets.\" 37 T. C. 461, 486.\n\nObviously, on these facts, there had been an appreciation in value accruing over a period of years, Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Co., supra, and an \"increase in the value of the income-producing property.\" Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., supra, at 266. This increase taxpayers were entitled to realize at capital gains rates on a cash sale of their stock; and likewise if they sold on a deferred payment \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n plan taking an installment note and a mortgage as security. Further, if the down payment was less than 30% (the 1954 Code requires no down payment at all) and the transaction otherwise satisfied I. R. C. 1939, 44, the gain itself could be reported on the installment basis.\n\nIn the actual transaction, the stock was transferred for a price payable on the installment basis but payable from the earnings of the company. Eventually $936,131.85 was realized by respondents. This transaction, we think, is a sale, and so treating it is wholly consistent with the purposes of the Code to allow capital gains treatment for realization upon the enhanced value of a capital asset.\n\nThe Commissioner, however, embellishes his risk-shifting argument. Purporting to probe the economic realities of the transaction, he reasons that if the seller continues to bear all the risk and the buyer none, the seller must be collecting a price for his risk-bearing in the form of an interest in future earnings over and above what would be a fair market value of the property. Since the seller bears the risk, the so-called purchase price must be excessive and must be simply a device to collect future earnings at capital gains rates.\n\nWe would hesitate to discount unduly the power of pure reason and the argument is not without force. But it does present difficulties. In the first place, it denies what the tax court expressly found - that the price paid was within reasonable limits based on the earnings and net worth of the company; and there is evidence in the record to support this finding. We do not have, therefore, a case where the price has been found excessive.\n\nSecondly, if an excessive price is such an inevitable result of the lack of risk-shifting, it would seem that it would not be an impossible task for the Commissioner to demonstrate the fact. However, in this case he offered no evidence whatsoever to this effect; and in a good many other cases involving similar transactions, in some of which \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 574]\n\u00a0\n the reasonableness of the price paid by a charity was actually contested, the Tax Court has found the sale price to be within reasonable limits, as it did in this case.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThirdly, the Commissioner ignores as well the fact that if the rents payable by Fortuna were deductible by it and not taxable to the Institute, the Institute could pay off the purchase price at a considerably faster rate than the ordinary corporate buyer subject to income taxes, a matter of considerable importance to a seller who wants the balance of his purchase price paid as rapidly as he can get it. The fact is that by April 30, 1955, a little over two years after closing this transaction, $412,595.77 had been paid on the note and within another year the sellers had collected another $238,498.80, for a total of $651,094.57.\n\nFurthermore, risk-shifting of the kind insisted on by the Commissioner has not heretofore been considered an essential ingredient of a sale for tax purposes. In LeTulle v. Scofield, \n308 \nU.S. 415\n, one corporation transferred properties to another for cash and bonds secured by the properties transferred. The Court held that there was \"a sale or exchange upon which gain or loss must be reckoned in accordance with the provisions of the revenue act dealing with the recognition of gain or loss upon a sale or exchange,\" id., at 421, since the seller retained only \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 575]\n\u00a0\n a creditor's interest rather than a proprietary one \"[T]hat the bonds were secured solely by the assets transferred and that, upon default, the bondholder would retake only the property sold, [did not change] his status from that of a creditor to one having a proprietary stake.\" Ibid. Compare Marr v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 536\n. To require a sale for tax purposes to be to a financially responsible buyer who undertakes to pay the purchase price from sources other than the earnings of the assets sold or to make a substantial down payment seems to us at odds with commercial practice and common understanding of what constitutes a sale. The term \"sale\" is used a great many times in the Internal Revenue Code and a wide variety of tax results hinge on the occurrence of a \"sale.\" To accept the Commissioner's definition of sale would have wide ramifications which we are not prepared to visit upon taxpayers, absent congressional guidance in this direction.\n\nThe Commissioner relies heavily upon the cases involving a transfer of mineral interests, the transferor receiving a bonus and retaining a royalty or other interest in the mineral production. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n; Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n; Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655\n; Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, \n326 \nU.S. 599\n; Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, \n328 \nU.S. 25\n; Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308\n. Thomas v. Perkins is deemed particularly pertinent. There a leasehold interest was transferred for a sum certain payable in oil as produced, and it was held that the amounts paid to the transferor were not includable in the income of the transferee but were income of the transferor. We do not, however, deem either Thomas v. Perkins or the other cases controlling.\n\nFirst, \"Congress . . . has recognized the peculiar character of the business of extracting natural resources,\" Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, \n328 \nU.S. 25, 33\n; \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 576]\n\u00a0\n see Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 413\n-414, which is viewed as an income-producing operation and not as a conversion of capital investment, Anderson v. Helvering, \n310 \nU.S. 404\n, at 407, but one which has its own built-in method of allowing through depletion \"a tax-free return of the capital consumed in the production of gross income through severance\" Anderson v. Helvering, supra, at 408, which is independent of cost and depends solely on production, Burton-Sutton, at 34. Percentage depletion allows an arbitrary deduction to compensate for exhaustion of the asset, regardless of cost incurred or any investment which the taxpayer may have made. The Commissioner, however, would assess to respondents as ordinary income the entire amount of all rental payments made by the Institute, regardless of the accumulated values in the corporation which the payments reflected and without regard for the present policy of the tax law to allow the taxpayer to realize on appreciated values at the capital gains rates.\n\nSecond, Thomas v. Perkins does not have unlimited sweep. The Court in Anderson v. Helvering, supra, pointed out that it was still possible for the owner of a working interest to divest himself finally and completely of his mineral interest by effecting a sale. In that case the owner of royalty interest, fee interest and deferred oil payments contracted to convey them for $160,000 payable $50,000 down and the balance from one-half the proceeds which might be derived from the oil and gas produced and from the sale of the fee title to any of the lands conveyed. The Court refused to extend Thomas v. Perkins beyond the oil payment transaction involved in that case. Since the transferor in Anderson had provided for payment of the purchase price from the sale of fee interest as well as from the production of oil and gas, \"the reservation of this additional type of security for the deferred payments serve[d] to distinguish this case from \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 577]\n\u00a0\n Thomas v. Perkins. It is similar to the reservation in a lease of oil payment rights together with a personal guarantee by the lessee that such payments shall at all events equal the specified sum.\" Anderson v. Helvering, supra, at 412-413. Hence, there was held to be an outright sale of the properties, all of the oil income therefrom being taxable to the transferee notwithstanding the fact of payment of part of it to the seller. The respondents in this case, of course, not only had rights against income, but if the income failed to amount to $250,000 in any two consecutive years, the entire amount could be declared due, which was secured by a lien on the real and personal properties of the company.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 578]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is another reason for us not to disturb the ruling of the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals. In 1963, the Treasury Department, in the course of hearings before the Congress, noted the availability of capital gains treatment on the sale of capital assets even though the seller retained an interest in the income produced by the assets. The Department proposed a change in the law which would have taxed as ordinary income the payments on the sale of a capital asset which were deferred over more than five years and were contingent on future income. Payments, though contingent on income, required to be made within five years would not have lost capital gains status nor would payments not contingent on income even though accompanied by payments which were. Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., Feb. 6, 7, 8 and 18, 1963, Pt. I (rev.), on the President's 1963 Tax Message, pp. 154-156.\n\nCongress did not adopt the suggested change\n9\n but it is significant for our purposes that the proposed amendment did not deny the fact or occurrence of a sale but would have taxed as ordinary income those income-contingent \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 579]\n\u00a0\n payments deferred for more than five years. If a purchaser could pay the purchase price out of earnings within five years, the seller would have capital gain rather than ordinary income. The approach was consistent with allowing appreciated values to be treated as capital gain but with appropriate safeguards against reserving additional rights to future income. In comparison, the Commissioner's position here is a clear case of \"overkill\" if aimed at preventing the involvement of tax-exempt entities in the purchase and operation of business enterprises. There are more precise approaches to this problem as well as to the question of the possibly excessive price paid by the charity or foundation. And if the Commissioner's approach is intended as a limitation upon the tax treatment of sales generally, it represents a considerable invasion of current capital gains policy, a matter which we think is the business of Congress, not ours.\n\nThe problems involved in the purchase of a going business by a tax-exempt organization have been considered and dealt with by the Congress. Likewise, it has given its attention to various kinds of transactions involving the payment of the agreed purchase price for property from the future earnings of the property itself. In both situations it has responded, if at all, with precise provisions of narrow application. We consequently deem it wise to \"leave to the Congress the fashioning of a rule which, in any event, must have wide ramifications.\" American Automobile Assn. v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 687, 697\n.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Revenue Act of 1950, c. 994, 64 Stat. 906, amended 101 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and added 421 through 424, 3813 and 3814.

Some of these cases are now pending on appeal in one or more of the courts of appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The net current assets subject to liabilities were sold by the Institute to Fortuna for a promissory not which was assigned to sellers. The lease covered the remaining assets of Clay Brown & Company. Fortuna was capitalized at $25,000, its capital being paid in by its stockholders from their own funds.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Clay Brown's personal liability for some of the indebtedness of Clay Brown & Company, assumed by Fortuna, was continued. He also personally guaranteed some additional indebtedness incurred by Fortuna.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Tax Court found nothing to indicate that the arrangement between the stockholders and the Institute contemplated the Brown family's being free at any time to take back and operate the business.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In all but four of the cases listed in note 3, supra, there was a finding that the price was within permissible limits. The exceptions are: Kolkey v. Commissioner, where the price was considered grossly excessive and the transaction a sham; Union Bank v. United States, in which the Court of Claims referred to the evidence of excessive price but nevertheless held a sale had taken place; Brekke v. Commissioner, where the seller was not before the court, the price was said to be twice the fair market value and the issue was the deductibility of the rent paid by the operating company to the exempt organization; and Estate of Hawley, in which there was no express treatment of the sale price, but the transaction was found to be a bona fide sale.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Respondents place considerable reliance on the rule applicable where patents are sold or assigned, the seller or assignor reserving an income interest. In Rev. Rul. 58-353, 1958-2 Cum. Bull. 408, the Service announced its acquiescence in various Tax Court cases holding that the consideration received by the owner of a patent for the assignment of a patent or the granting of an exclusive license to such patent may be treated as the proceeds of a sale of property for income tax purposes, even though the consideration received by the transferor is measured by production, use, or sale of the patented article. The Government now says that the Revenue Ruling amounts only to a decision to cease litigating the question, at least temporarily, and that the cases on which the rule is based are wrong in principle and inconsistent with the cases dealing with the taxation of mineral interests. We note, however, that in Rev. Rul. 60-226, 1960-1 Cum. Bull. 26, the Service extended the same treatment to the copyright field. Furthermore, the Secretary of the Treasury in 1963 recognized the present law to be that \"the sale of a patent by the inventor may be treated as the sale of a capital asset,\" Hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., Feb. 6, 7, 8 and 18, 1963, Pt. I (rev.), on the President's 1963 Tax Message, p. 150, and the Congress failed to enact the changes in the law which the Department recommended. These developments in the patent field obviously do not help the position of the Commissioner. Nor does I. R. C. 1954, 1235, which expressly permits specified patent sales to be treated as sales of capital assets entitled to capital gains treatment. We need not, however, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 578]\n\u00a0\n decide here whether the extraction and patent cases are irreconcilable or whether, instead, each situation has its own peculiar characteristics justifying discrete treatment under the sale and exchange language of 1222. Whether the patent cases are correct or not, absent 1235, the fact remains that this case involves the transfer of corporate stock which has substantially appreciated in value and a purchase price payable from income which has been held to reflect the fair market value of the assets which the stock represents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It did, however, accept and enact another suggestion made by the Treasury Department. Section 483, which was added to the Code, provided for treating a part of the purchase price as interest in installment sales transactions where no interest was specified. The provision was to apply as well when the payments provided for were indefinite as to their size, as for example \"where the payments are in part at least dependent upon future income derived from the property.\" S. Rep. No. 830, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 103. This section would apparently now apply to a transaction such as occurred in this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nWere it not for the tax laws, the respondents' transaction with the Institute would make no sense, except as one arising from a charitable impulse. However the tax laws exist as an economic reality in the businessman's world, much like the existence of a competitor. Businessmen \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 580]\n\u00a0\n plan their affairs around both, and a tax dollar is just as real as one derived from any other source. The Code gives the Institute a tax exemption which makes it capable of taking a greater after-tax return from a business than could a nontax-exempt individual or corporation. Respondents traded a residual interest in their business for a faster payout apparently made possible by the Institute's exemption. The respondents gave something up; they received something substantially different in return. If words are to have meaning, there was a \"sale or exchange.\"\n\nObviously the Institute traded on its tax exemption. The Government would deny that there was an exchange, essentially on the theory that the Institute did not put anything at risk; since its exemption is unlimited, like the magic purse that always contains another penny, the Institute gave up nothing by trading on it.\n\nOne may observe preliminarily that the Government's remedy for the so-called \"bootstrap\" sale - defining sale or exchange so as to require the shifting of some business risks - would accomplish little by way of closing off such sales in the future. It would be neither difficult nor burdensome for future users of the bootstrap technique to arrange for some shift of risks. If such sales are considered a serious abuse, ineffective judicial correctives will only postpone the day when Congress is moved to deal with the problem comprehensively. Furthermore, one may ask why, if the Government does not like the tax consequences of such sales, the proper course is not to attack the exemption rather than to deny the existence of a \"real\" sale or exchange.\n\nThe force underlying the Government's position is that the respondents did clearly retain some risk-bearing interest in the business. Instead of leaping from this premise to the conclusion that there was no sale or exchange, the Government might more profitably have \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 581]\n\u00a0\n broken the transaction into components and attempted to distinguish between the interest which respondents retained and the interest which they exchanged. The worth of a business depends upon its ability to produce income over time. What respondents gave up was not the entire business, but only their interest in the business' ability to produce income in excess of that which was necessary to pay them off under the terms of the transaction. The value of such a residual interest is a function of the risk element of the business and the amount of income it is capable of producing per year, and will necessarily be substantially less than the value of the total business. Had the Government argued that it was that interest which respondents exchanged, and only to that extent should they have received capital gains treatment, we would perhaps have had a different case.\n\nI mean neither to accept nor reject this approach, or any other which falls short of the all-or-nothing theory specifically argued by the petitioner, specifically opposed by the respondents, and accepted by the Court as the premise for its decision. On a highly complex issue with as wide ramifications as the one before us, it is vitally important to have had the illumination provided by briefing and argument directly on point before any particular path is irrevocably taken. Where the definition of \"sale or exchange\" is concerned, the Court can afford to proceed slowly and by stages. The illumination which has been provided in the present case convinces me that the position taken by the Government is unsound and does not warrant reversal of the judgment below. Therefore I concur in the judgment to affirm.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK join, dissenting.\n\nThe essential facts of this case which are undisputed illuminate the basic nature of the transaction at issue. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 582]\n\u00a0\n Respondents conveyed their stock in Clay Brown & Co., a corporation owned almost entirely by Clay Brown and the members of his immediate family, to the California Institute for Cancer Research, a tax-exempt foundation. The Institute liquidated the corporation and transferred its assets under a five-year lease to a new corporation, Fortuna, which was managed by respondent Clay Brown, and the shares of which were in the name of Clay Brown's attorneys, who also served as Fortuna's directors. The business thus continued under a new name with no essential change in control of its operations. Fortuna agreed to pay 80% of its pretax profits to the Institute as rent under the lease, and the Institute agreed to pay 90% of this amount to respondents in payment for their shares until the respondents received $1,300,000, at which time their interest would terminate and the Institute would own the complete beneficial interest as well as all legal interest in the business. If remittances to respondents were less than $250,000 in any two consecutive years or any other provision in the agreements was violated, they could recover the property. The Institute had no personal liability. In essence respondents conveyed their interest in the business to the Institute in return for 72% of the profits of the business and the right to recover the business assets if payments fell behind schedule.\n\nAt first glance it might appear odd that the sellers would enter into this transaction, for prior to the sale they had a right to 100% of the corporation's income, but after the sale they had a right to only 72% of that income and would lose the business after 10 years to boot. This transaction, however, afforded the sellers several advantages. The principal advantage sought by the sellers was capital gain, rather than ordinary income, treatment for that share of the business profits which they received. Further, because of the Tax Code's charitable exemption\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 583]\n\u00a0\n and the lease arrangement with Fortuna,\n2\n the Institute believed that neither it nor Fortuna would have to pay income tax on the earnings of the business. Thus the sellers would receive free of corporate taxation, and subject only to personal taxation at capital gains rates, 72% of the business earnings until they were paid $1,300,000. Without the sale they would receive only 48% of the business earnings, the rest going to the Government in corporate taxes, and this 48% would be subject to personal taxation at ordinary rates. In effect the Institute sold the respondents the use of its tax exemption, enabling the respondents to collect $1,300,000 from the business more quickly than they otherwise could and to pay taxes on this amount at capital gains rates. In return, the Institute received a nominal amount of the profits while the $1,300,000 was being paid, and it was to receive the whole business after this debt had been paid off. In any realistic sense the Government's grant of a tax exemption was used by the Institute as part of an arrangement that allowed it to buy a business that in fact cost it nothing. I cannot believe that Congress intended such a result.\n\nThe Court today legitimates this bootstrap transaction and permits respondents the tax advantage which the parties sought. The fact that respondent Brown, as a \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 584]\n\u00a0\n result of the Courts holding, escapes payment of about $60,000 in taxes may not seem intrinsically important - although every failure to pay the proper amount of taxes under a progressive income tax system impairs the integrity of that system. But this case in fact has very broad implications. We are told by the parties and by interested amici that this is a test case. The outcome of this case will determine whether this bootstrap scheme for the conversion of ordinary income into capital gain, which has already been employed on a number of occasions, will become even more widespread.\n3\n It is quite clear that the Court's decision approving this tax device will give additional momentum to its speedy proliferation. In my view Congress did not sanction the use of this scheme under the present revenue laws to obtain the tax advantages which the Court authorizes. Moreover, I believe that the Court's holding not only deviates from the intent of Congress but also departs from this Court's prior decisions.\n\nThe purpose of the capital gains provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 1201 et seq., is to prevent gains which accrue over a long period of time from being taxed in the year of their realization through a sale at high rates resulting from their inclusion in the higher tax brackets. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n. 106. These provisions are not designed, however, to allow capital gains treatment for the recurrent receipt of commercial or business income. In light of these purposes this Court has held that a \"sale\" for capital gains purposes is not produced by the mere transfer of legal title. Burnet v. Harmel, supra; Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n. Rather, at the very least, there must be a meaningful economic transfer in addition to a change in legal title. See Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n. Thus the question posed here is not whether this transaction constitutes a sale within the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 585]\n\u00a0\n terms of the Uniform Commercial Code or the Uniform Sales Act - we may assume it does - but, rather, the question is whether, at the time legal title was transferred, there was also an economic transfer sufficient to convert ordinary income into capital gain by treating this transaction as a \"sale\" within the terms of I. R. C. 1222 (3).\n\nIn dealing with what constitutes a sale for capital gains purposes, this Court has been careful to look through formal legal arrangements to the underlying economic realities. Income produced in the mineral extraction business, which \"resemble[s] a manufacturing business carried on by the use of the soil,\" Burnet v. Harmel, supra, at 107, is taxed to the person who retains an economic interest in the oil. Thus, while an outright sale of mineral interests qualifies for capital gains treatment, a purported sale of mineral interests in exchange for a royalty from the minerals produced is treated only as a transfer with a retained economic interest, and the royalty payments are fully taxable as ordinary income. Burnet v. Harmel, supra. See Palmer v. Bender, supra.\n\nIn Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655\n, an owner of oil interests transferred them in return for an \"oil production payment,\" an amount which is payable only out of the proceeds of later commercial sales of the oil transferred. The Court held that this transfer, which constituted a sale under state law, did not constitute a sale for tax purposes because there was not a sufficient shift of economic risk. The transferor would be paid only if oil was later produced and sold; if it was not produced, he would not be paid. The risks run by the transferor of making or losing money from the oil were shifted so slightly by the transfer that no 1222 (3) sale existed, notwithstanding the fact that the transaction conveyed title as a matter of state law, and once the payout was complete, full ownership of the minerals was to vest in the purchaser. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 586]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI believe that the sellers here retained an economic interest in the business fully as great as that retained by the seller of oil interests in Thomas v. Perkins. The sellers were to be paid only out of the proceeds of the business. If the business made money they would be paid; if it did not, they would not be paid. In the latter event. of course, they could recover the business, but a secured interest in a business which was losing money would be of dubious value. There was no other security. The Institute was not bound to pay any sum whatsoever. The Institute, in fact, promised only to channel to the sellers a portion of the income it received from Fortuna.\n\nMoreover, in numerous cases this Court has refused to transfer the incidents of taxation along with a transfer of legal title when the transferor retains considerable control over the income-producing asset transferred. See, e. g., Commissioner v. Sunnen, \n333 \nU.S. 591\n; Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n; Corliss v. Bowers, supra. Control of the business did not, in fact, shift in the transaction here considered. Clay Brown, by the terms of the purchase agreement and the lease, was to manage Fortuna. Clay Brown was given power to hire and arrange for the terms of employment of all other employees of the corporation. The lease provided that \"if for any reason Clay Brown is unable or unwilling to so act, the person or persons holding a majority interest in the principal note described in the Purchase Agreement shall have the right to approve his successor to act as general manager of Lessee company.\" Thus the shareholders of Clay Brown & Co. assured themselves of effective control over the management of Fortuna. Furthermore, Brown's attorneys were the named shareholders of Fortuna and its Board of Directors. The Institute had no control over the business.\n\nI would conclude that on these facts there was not a sufficient shift of economic risk or control of the business \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 587]\n\u00a0\n to warrant treating this transaction as a \"sale\" for tax purposes. Brown retained full control over the operations of the business; the risk of loss and the opportunity to profit from gain during the normal operation of the business shifted but slightly. If the operation lost money, Brown stood to lose; if it gained money Brown stood to gain, for he would be paid off faster. Moreover, the entire purchase price was to be paid out of the ordinary income of the corporation, which was to be received by Brown on a recurrent basis as he had received it during the period he owned the corporation. I do not believe that Congress intended this recurrent receipt of ordinary business income to be taxed at capital gains rates merely because the business was to be transferred to a tax-exempt entity at some future date. For this reason I would apply here the established rule that, despite formal legal arrangements, a sale does not take place until there has been a significant economic change such as a shift in risk or in control of the business.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nTo hold as the Court does that this transaction constitutes a \"sale\" within the terms of I. R. C. 1222 (3), thereby giving rise to capital gain for the income received, legitimates considerable tax evasion. Even if the Court restricts its holding, allowing only those transactions to be 1222 (3) sales in which the price is not excessive, its decision allows considerable latitude for the unwarranted conversion of ordinary income into capital gain. Valuation of a closed corporation is notoriously difficult. The Tax Court in the present case did not determine that the price for which the corporation was sold represented its true value; it simply stated that the price \"was the result \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 588]\n\u00a0\n of real negotiating\" and \"within a reasonable range in light of the earnings history of the corporation and the adjusted net worth of the corporate assets.\" 37 T. C., at 486. The Tax Court, however, also said that \"[i]t may be . . . that petitioner [Clay Brown] would have been unable to sell the stock at as favorable a price to anyone other than a tax-exempt organization.\" 37 T. C., at 485. Indeed, this latter supposition is highly likely. for the Institute was selling its tax exemption, and this is not the sort of asset which is limited in quantity. Though the Institute might have negotiated in order to receive beneficial ownership of the corporation as soon as possible, the Institute, at no cost to itself, could increase the price to produce an offer too attractive for the seller to decline. Thus it is natural to anticipate sales such as this taking place at prices on the upper boundary of what courts will hold to be a reasonable price - at prices which will often be considerably greater than what the owners of a closed corporation could have received in a sale to buyers who were not selling their tax exemptions. Unless Congress repairs the damage done by the Court's holding, I should think that charities will soon own a considerable number of closed corporations, the owners of which will see no good reason to continue paying taxes at ordinary income rates. It should not be necessary, however, for Congress to address itself to this loophole, for I believe that under the present laws it is clear that Congress did not intend to accord capital gains treatment to the proceeds of the type of sale present here.\n\nAlthough the Court implies that it will hold to be \"sales\" only those transactions in which the price is reasonable. I do not believe that the logic of the Court's opinion will justify so restricting its holding. If this transaction is a sale under the Internal Revenue Code, entitling its proceeds to capital gains treatment because it was arrived at after hard negotiating, title in a conveyancing \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 589]\n\u00a0\n sense passed, and the beneficial ownership was expected to pass at a later date, then the question recurs, which the Court does not answer, why a similar transaction would cease to be a sale if hard negotiating produced a purchase price much greater than actual value. The Court relies upon Kolkey v. Commissioner, 254 F.2d 51 (C. A. 7th Cir.), as authority holding that a bootstrap transaction will be struck down where the price is excessive. In Kolkey, however, the price to be paid was so much greater than the worth of the corporation in terms of its anticipated income that it was highly unlikely that the price would in fact ever be paid; consequently it was improbable that the sellers' interest in the business would ever be extinguished. Therefore, in Kolkey the court. viewing the case as one involving \"thin capitalization,\" treated the notes held by the sellers as equity in the new corporation and payments on them as dividends. Those who fashion \"bootstrap\" purchases have become considerably more sophisticated since Kolkey; vastly excessive prices are unlikely to be found and transactions are fashioned so that the \"thin capitalization\" argument is conceptually inapplicable. Thus I do not see what rationale the Court might use to strike down price transactions which, though excessive, do not reach Kolkey's dimensions, when it upholds the one here under consideration. Such transactions would have the same degree of risk-shifting, there would be no less a transfer of ownership, and consideration supplied by the buyer need be no less than here.\n\nFurther, a bootstrap tax avoidance scheme can easily be structured under which the holder of any income-earning asset \"sells\" his asset to a tax-exempt buyer for a promise to pay him the income produced for a period of years. The buyer in such a transaction would do nothing whatsoever; the seller would be delighted to lose his asset at the end of, say, 30 years in return for capital gains treatment \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 590]\n\u00a0\n of all income earned during that period. It is difficult to see, on the Court's rationale, why such a scheme is not a sale. And, if I am wrong in my reading of the Court's opinion, and if the Court would strike down such a scheme on the ground that there is no economic shifting of risk or control, it is difficult to see why the Court upholds the sale presently before it in which control does not change and any shifting of risk is nominal.\n\nI believe that the Court's overly conceptual approach has led to a holding which will produce serious erosion of our progressive taxing system, resulting in greater tax burdens upon all taxpayers. The tax avoidance routes opened by the Court's opinion will surely be used to advantage by the owners of closed corporations and other income-producing assets in order to evade ordinary income taxes and pay at capital gains rates, with a resultant large-scale ownership of private businesses by tax-exempt organizations.\n5\n While the Court justifies its result in the name of conceptual purity,\n6\n it simultaneously violates long-standing congressional tax policies that capital gains treatment is to be given to significant economic transfers of investment-type assets but not to ordinary commercial or business income and that transactions are to be judged on their entire substance rather than their naked form. Though turning tax consequences on form alone might produce greater certainty of the tax results of any transaction, this stability exacts as its price the certainty that tax evasion will be produced. In Commissioner v. P. G. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 591]\n\u00a0\n Lake, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 260, 265\n, this Court recognized that the purpose of the capital gains provisions of the Internal Revenue Code is \"`to relieve the taxpayer from . . . excessive tax burdens on gains resulting from a conversion of capital investments, and to remove the deterrent effect of those burdens on such conversions.' . . . And this exception has always been narrowly construed so as to protect the revenue against artful devices.\" I would hold in keeping with this purpose and in order to prevent serious erosion of the ordinary income tax provisions of the Code, that the bootstrap transaction revealed by the facts here considered is not a \"sale\" within the meaning of the capital gains provisions of the Code, but that it obviously is an \"artful device,\" which this Court ought not to legitimate. The Court justifies the untoward result of this case as permitted tax avoidance; I believe it to be a plain and simple case of unwarranted tax evasion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See I. R. C. 1954, 501 (c) (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This lease arrangement was designed to permit the Institute to take advantage of its charitable exemption to avoid taxes on payment of Fortuna's profits to it, with Fortuna receiving a deduction for the rental payments as an ordinary and necessary business expense, thus avoiding taxes to both. Though unrelated business income is usually taxable when received by charities, an exception is made for income received from the lease of real and personal property of less than five years. See I. R. C. 514; Lanning, Tax Erosion and the \"Bootstrap Sale\" of a Business-I, 108 Pa. L. Rev. 623, 684-689. Though denial of the charity's tax exemption on rent received from Fortuna would also remove the economic incentive underlying this bootstrap transaction, there is no indication in the Court's opinion that such income is not tax exempt. See the Court's opinion, ante, at 565-566.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See the articles cited in the majority opinion, ante, at 566, n. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The fact that respondents were to lose complete control of the business after the payments were complete was taken into account by the Commissioner, for he treated the business in respondents' hands as a wasting asset, see I. R. C. 1954, 167, and allowed them to offset their basis in the stock against the payments received.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Attorneys for amici have pointed out that tax-exempt charities which they represent have bought numerous closed corporations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It should be noted, however, that the Court's holding produces some rather unusual conceptual results. For example, after the payout is complete the Institute presumably would have a basis of $1,300,000 in a business that in reality cost it nothing. If anyone deserves such a basis, it is the Government, whose grant of tax exemption is being used by the Institute to acquire the business. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 563, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER v. NOEL ESTATE(1965)\nNo. 503\nArgued: April 1, 1965Decided: April 29, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Just prior to boarding an airplane which later crashed in flight decedent applied for flight insurance policies, naming his wife as beneficiary. The policies, which granted the insured the right to assign them or to change the beneficiary, were handed to the wife, who was paid their face value following the decedent's death from the crash. The petitioner determined that the proceeds should have been included in the estate tax return pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 2042 (2), which requires inclusion of amounts received by beneficiaries from insurance on the life of the decedent if at his death he possessed any of the incidents of ownership. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner's ruling, but the Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing life insurance, payable inevitably, from accident insurance, which covers an evitable risk. Held:\n\n 1. In accordance with long-standing and consistent administrative interpretation deemed to have the effect of law, as applied to this substantially re-enacted statute, these insurance policies were on the \"life of the decedent\" within the meaning of 2042 (2).

Merrey, Jr. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 679]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a federal estate tax case, raising questions under 2042 (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 2042 (2) (1958 ed.), which requires inclusion in the gross estate of a decedent of amounts received by beneficiaries other than the executor from \"insurance under policies on the life of the decedent\" if the decedent \"possessed at his death any of the incidents of ownership, exercisable either alone or in conjunction with any other person. . . .\"\n1\n The questions presented in this case are whether certain flight insurance policies payable upon the accidental death of the insured were policies \"on the life of the decedent\" and whether at his death he had reserved any of the \"incidents of ownership\" in the policies.\n\nThese issues emerge from the following facts. Respondent Ruth M. Noel drove her husband from their home to New York International Airport where he was to take an airplane to Venezuela. Just before taking off, Mr. Noel signed applications for two round-trip flight insurance policies, aggregating $125,000 and naming his wife as beneficiary. Mrs. Noel testified that she paid the premiums of $2.50 each on the policies and that her husband then instructed the sales clerk to \"give them to my \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 680]\n\u00a0\n wife. They are hers now, I no longer have anything to do with them.\" The clerk gave her the policies, which she kept. Less than three hours later Mr. Noel's plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and he and all others aboard were killed. Thereafter the companies paid Mrs. Noel the $125,000 face value of the policies, which was not included in the estate tax return filed by his executors. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the proceeds of the policies should have been included and the Tax Court sustained that determination, holding that the flight accident policies were insurance \"on the life of the decedent\"; that Mr. Noel had possessed exercisable \"incidents of ownership\" in the policies at his death; and that the $125,000 paid to Mrs. Noel as beneficiary was therefore includable in the gross estate. 39 T. C. 466. Although agreeing that decedent's reserved right to assign the policies and to change the beneficiary amounted to \"exercisable incidents of ownership within the meaning of the statute,\" the Court of Appeals nevertheless reversed, holding that given \"its ordinary, plain and generally accepted meaning,\" the statutory phrase \"policies on the life of the decedent\" does not apply to insurance paid on account of accidental death under policies like those here. 332 F.2d 950. The court's reason for drawing the distinction was that under a life insurance contract an insurer \"agrees to pay a specified sum upon the occurrence of an inevitable event,\" whereas accident insurance covers a risk \"which is evitable and not likely to occur.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 332 F.2d, at 952. Because of the importance of an authoritative answer to these questions in the administration of the estate tax laws, we granted certiorari to decide them. \n379 \nU.S. 927\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn 1929, 36 years ago, the Board of Tax Appeals, predecessor to the Tax Court, held in Ackerman v. Commissioner, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 681]\n\u00a0\n 15 B. T. A. 635, that \"amounts received as accident insurance\" because of the death of the insured were includable in the estate of the deceased.\n2\n The Board of Tax Appeals recognized that \"there is a distinction between life insurance and accident insurance, the former insuring against death in any event and the latter . . . against death under certain contingencies . . . .\" The Court of Appeals in the case now before us considered this distinction between an \"inevitable\" and an \"evitable\" event to be of crucial significance under the statute. The Board of Tax Appeals in Ackerman did not, stating \"we fail to see why one is not taken out upon the life of the policy-holder as much as the other. In each case the risk assumed by the insurer is the loss of the insured's life, and the payment of the insurance money is contingent upon the loss of life.\" This view of the Board of Tax Appeals is wholly consistent with the language of the statute itself which makes no distinction between \"policies on the life of the decedent\" which are payable in all events and those payable only if death comes in a certain way or within a certain time. Even were the statutory language less clear, since the Board of Tax Appeals' Ackerman case it has been the settled and consistent administrative practice to include insurance proceeds for accidental death under policies like these in the estates of decedents. The Treasury Regulations remain unchanged from the time of the Ackerman decision\n3\n and from that day to this Congress \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 682]\n\u00a0\n has never attempted to limit the scope of that decision or the established administrative construction of 2042 (2), although it has re-enacted that section and amended it in other respects a number of times.\n4\n We have held in many cases that such a long-standing administrative interpretation, applying to a substantially re-enacted statute, is deemed to have received congressional approval and has the effect of law. See, e. g., National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n; United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459, 466\n. We hold here that these insurance policies, whether called \"flight accident insurance\" or \"life insurance,\" were in effect insurance taken out on the \"life of the decedent\" within the meaning of 2042 (2).\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe executors' second contention is that even if these were policies \"on the life of the decedent,\" Mrs. Noel owned them completely, and the decedent therefore possessed no exercisable incident of ownership in them at the time of his death so as to make the proceeds includable in his estate. While not clearly spelled out, the contention that the decedent reserved no incident of ownership in the policies rests on three alternative claims: (a) that Mrs. Noel purchased the policies and therefore owned them; (b) that even if her husband owned the policies, he gave them to her, thereby depriving himself of power to assign the policies or to change the beneficiary; and (c) even assuming he had contractual power to assign the policies or make a beneficiary change, this power was \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 683]\n\u00a0\n illusory as he could not possibly have exercised it in the interval between take-off and the fatal crash in the Atlantic.\n\n(a) The contention that Mrs. Noel bought the policies and therefore owned them rests solely on her testimony that she furnished the money for their purchase, intending thereby to preserve her right to continue as beneficiary. Accepting her claim that she supplied the money to buy the policies for her own benefit (which the Tax Court did not decide), what she bought nonetheless were policy contracts containing agreements between her husband and the companies. The contracts themselves granted to Mr. Noel the right either to assign the policies or to change the beneficiary without her consent. Therefore the contracts she bought by their very terms rebut her claim that she became the complete, unconditional owner of the policies with an irrevocable right to remain the beneficiary.\n\n(b) The contention that Mr. Noel gave or assigned the policies to her and therefore was without power thereafter to assign them or to change the beneficiary stands no better under these facts. The contract terms provided that these policies could not be assigned nor could the beneficiary be changed without a written endorsement on the policies. No such assignment or change of beneficiary was endorsed on these policies, and consequently the power to assign the policies or change the beneficiary remained in the decedent at the time of his death.\n\n(c) Obviously, there was no practical opportunity for the decedent to assign the policies or change the beneficiary between the time he boarded the plane and the time he died. That time was too short and his wife had the policies in her possession at home. These circumstances disabled him for the moment from exercising those \"incidents of ownership\" over the policies which were undoubtedly his. Death intervened before this temporary disability \n\n[380 \nU.S. 678, 684]\n\u00a0\n was removed. But the same could be said about a man owning an ordinary life insurance policy who boarded the plane at the same time or for that matter about any man's exercise of ownership over his property while aboard an airplane in the three hours before a fatal crash. It would stretch the imagination to think that Congress intended to measure estate tax liability by an individual's fluctuating, day-by-day, hour-by-hour capacity to dispose of property which he owns. We hold that estate tax liability for policies \"with respect to which the decedent possessed at his death any of the incidents of ownership\" depends on a general, legal power to exercise ownership, without regard to the owner's ability to exercise it at a particular moment. Nothing we have said is to be taken as meaning that a policyholder is without power to divest himself of all incidents of ownership over his insurance policies by a proper gift or assignment, so as to bar its inclusion in his gross estate under 2042 (2). What we do hold is that no such transfer was made of the policies here involved. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \" 2042.

Appellant was convicted on this charge also and was sentenced to the maximum penalty under the statute of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine, which penalty was cumulative with those in No. 24. These convictions were affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, 245 La. 303, 158 So.2d 172. Appellant appealed to this Court contending that the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n377 \nU.S. 921\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe shall first consider appellant's contention that this statute must be declared invalid on its face as an unjustified restriction upon freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis statute was passed by Louisiana in 1950 and was modeled after a bill pertaining to the federal judiciary, which Congress enacted later in 1950, 64 Stat. 1018, 18 U.S.C. 1507 (1958 ed.). Since that time, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have passed similar statutes. Mass. Ann. Laws, c. 268, 13A; Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, 4327. The federal statute resulted from the picketing of federal courthouses by partisans of the defendants during trials involving leaders of the Communist Party. This picketing prompted an adverse reaction from both the bar and the general public. A number of groups urged legislation to prohibit it. At a special meeting held in March 1949, the Judicial Conference of the United States passed the following resolution: \"Resolved, That we condemn the practice of picketing the courts, and believe that effective means should be taken to prevent it.\" Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 203 (1949). A Special Committee on Proposed Legislation to Prohibit Picketing of the Courts was appointed to make recommendations to the Conference on this subject. Ibid. In its Report to the Judicial Conference, dated September 23, 1949, at p. 3, the Special Committee stated: \"The sentiment of bar associations and individual lawyers has been and is practically unanimous in favor of legislation to prohibit picketing of courts.\" Upon the recommendation of this Special Committee, the Judicial Conference urged the prompt enactment of the then-pending bill. Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 17-18 (1949). Similar recommendations were made by the American Bar Association, numerous state and local bar associations, and individual lawyers and judges. See Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1681 and H. R. 3766, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 1281, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep.

Soc. 53 (1949).\n\nThis statute, unlike the two previously considered, is a precise, narrowly drawn regulatory statute which proscribes certain specific behavior. Cf. Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229, 236\n. It prohibits a particular type of conduct, namely, picketing and parading, in a few specified locations, in or near courthouses.\n\nThere can be no question that a State has a legitimate interest in protecting its judicial system from the pressures which picketing near a courthouse might create. Since we are committed to a government of laws and not of men, it is of the utmost importance that the administration of justice be absolutely fair and orderly. This Court has recognized that the unhindered and untrammeled functioning of our courts is part of the very foundation of our constitutional democracy. See Wood v. Georgia, \n370 \nU.S. 375, 383\n. The constitutional safeguards relating to the integrity of the criminal process attend every stage of a criminal proceeding, starting with arrest and culminating with a trial \"in a courtroom presided over by a judge.\" Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723, 727\n. There can be no doubt that they embrace the fundamental conception of a fair trial, and that they exclude influence or domination by either a hostile or friendly mob. There is no room at any stage of judicial proceedings for such intervention; mob law is the very antithesis of due process. See Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 347\n (Holmes, J., dissenting). A State may adopt safeguards necessary and appropriate to assure that the administration of justice at all stages is free from outside control and influence. A narrowly drawn statute such as the one under review is obviously a safeguard both necessary and appropriate to vindicate the State's interest in assuring justice under law. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 563]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor does such a statute infringe upon the constitutionally protected rights of free speech and free assembly. The conduct which is the subject of this statute - picketing and parading - is subject to regulation even though intertwined with expression and association. The examples are many of the application by this Court of the principle that certain forms of conduct mixed with speech may be regulated or prohibited. The most classic of these was pointed out long ago by Mr. Justice Holmes: \"The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.\" Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n. A man may be punished for encouraging the commission of a crime, Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273\n, or for uttering \"fighting words,\" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \n315 \nU.S. 568\n. This principle has been applied to picketing and parading in labor disputes. See Hughes v. Superior Court, \n339 \nU.S. 460\n; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n; Building Service Employees v. Gazzam, \n339 \nU.S. 532\n. But cf. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n. These authorities make it clear, as the Court said in Giboney, that \"it has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\" Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra, at 502.\n\nBridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n, and Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331\n, do not hold to the contrary. Both these cases dealt with the power of a judge to sentence for contempt persons who published or caused to be published writings commenting on judicial proceedings. They involved newspaper editorials, an editorial cartoon, and a telegram sent by a labor leader to the Secretary of Labor. Here we deal not with the contempt power - \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 564]\n\u00a0\n a power which is \"based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature.\" Bridges v. California, supra, at 260. Rather, we are reviewing a statute narrowly drawn to punish specific conduct that infringes a substantial state interest in protecting the judicial process. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 307\n-308; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra. We are not concerned here with such a pure form of expression as newspaper comment or a telegram by a citizen to a public official. We deal in this case not with free speech alone, but with expression mixed with particular conduct. In Giboney, this Court expressly recognized this distinction when it said, \"In holding this, we are mindful of the essential importance to our society of a vigilant protection of freedom of speech and press. Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 263\n. States cannot consistently with our Constitution abridge those freedoms to obviate slight inconveniences or annoyances. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 162\n. But placards used as an essential and inseparable part of a grave offense against an important public law cannot immunize that unlawful conduct from state control.\" \n336 \nU.S., at 501\n-502.\n\nWe hold that this statute on its face is a valid law dealing with conduct subject to regulation so as to vindicate important interests of society and that the fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe now deal with the Louisiana statute as applied to the conduct in this case. The group of 2,000, led by appellant, paraded and demonstrated before the courthouse. Judges and court officers were in attendance to discharge their respective functions. It is undisputed that a major purpose of the demonstration was to protest \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 565]\n\u00a0\n what the demonstrators considered an \"illegal\" arrest of 23 students the previous day. While the students had not been arraigned or their trial set for any day certain, they were charged with violation of the law, and the judges responsible for trying them and passing upon the legality of their arrest were then in the building.\n\nIt is, of course, true that most judges will be influenced only by what they see and hear in court. However, judges are human; and the legislature has the right to recognize the danger that some judges, jurors, and other court officials, will be consciously or unconsciously influenced by demonstrations in or near their courtrooms both prior to and at the time of the trial. A State may also properly protect the judicial process from being misjudged in the minds of the public. Suppose demonstrators paraded and picketed for weeks with signs asking that indictments be dismissed, and that a judge, completely uninfluenced by these demonstrations, dismissed the indictments. A State may protect against the possibility of a conclusion by the public under these circumstances that the judge's action was in part a product of intimidation and did not flow only from the fair and orderly working of the judicial process. See S. Rep. No. 732, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 4.\n\nAppellant invokes the clear and present danger doctrine in support of his argument that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to the conduct involved here. He says, relying upon Pennekamp and Bridges, that \"[n]o reason exists to apply a different standard to the case of a criminal penalty for a peaceful demonstration in front of a courthouse than the standard of clear and present danger applied in the contempt cases.\" (Appellant's Br., p. 22.) He defines the standard to be applied to both situations to be whether the expression of opinion presents a clear and present danger to the administration of justice. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 566]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have already pointed out the important differences between the contempt cases and the present one, supra, at 563-564. Here we deal not with the contempt power but with a narrowly drafted statute and not with speech in its pristine form but with conduct of a totally different character. Even assuming the applicability of a general clear and present danger test, it is one thing to conclude that the mere publication of a newspaper editorial or a telegram to a Secretary of Labor, however critical of a court, presents no clear and present danger to the administration of justice and quite another thing to conclude that crowds, such as this, demonstrating before a courthouse may not be prohibited by a legislative determination based on experience that such conduct inherently threatens the judicial process. We therefore reject the clear and present danger argument of appellant.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nAppellant additionally argues that his conviction violated due process as there was no evidence of intent to obstruct justice or influence any judicial official as required by the statute. Thompson v. Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n. We cannot agree that there was no evidence within the \"due process\" rule enunciated in Thompson v. Louisville. We have already noted that various witnesses and Cox himself stated that a major purpose of the demonstration was to protest what was considered to be an illegal arrest of 23 students. Thus, the very subject matter of the demonstration was an arrest which is normally the first step in a series of legal proceedings. The demonstration was held in the vicinity of the courthouse where the students' trials would take place. The courthouse contained the judges who in normal course would be called upon to try the students' cases just as they tried appellant. Ronnie Moore, the student leader of the demonstration, a defense witness, stated, as we understand \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 567]\n\u00a0\n his testimony, that the demonstration was in part to protest injustice; he felt it was a form of \"moral persuasion\" and hoped it would have its effects. The fact that the students were not then on trial and had not been arraigned is not controlling in the face of this affirmative evidence manifesting the plain intent of the demonstrators to condemn the arrest and ensuing judicial proceedings against the prisoners as unfair and unwarranted. The fact that by their lights appellant and the 2,000 students were seeking justice and not its obstruction is as irrelevant as would be the motives of the mob condemned by Justice Holmes in Frank v. Mangum, supra. Louisiana, as we have pointed out supra, has the right to construe its statute to prevent parading and picketing from unduly influencing the administration of justice at any point or time in its process, regardless of whether the motives of the demonstrators are good or bad.\n\nWhile this case contains direct evidence taking it out of the Thompson v. Louisville doctrine, even without this evidence, we would be compelled to reject the contention that there was no proof of intent. Louisiana surely has the right to infer the appropriate intent from circumstantial evidence. At the very least, a group of demonstrators parading and picketing before a courthouse where a criminal charge is pending, in protest against the arrest of those charged, may be presumed to intend to influence judges, jurors, witnesses or court officials. Cf. Screws v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 91, 107\n (opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS).\n\nAbsent an appropriately drawn and applicable statute, entirely different considerations would apply if, for example, the demonstrators were picketing to protest the actions of a mayor or other official of a city completely unrelated to any judicial proceedings, who just happened to have an office located in the courthouse building. Cf. In re Brinn, 305 N. Y. 887, 114 N. E. 2d 430; Joint Hearings, supra, at 20. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThere are, however, more substantial constitutional objections arising from appellant's conviction on the particular facts of this case. Appellant was convicted for demonstrating not \"in,\" but \"near\" the courthouse. It is undisputed that the demonstration took place on the west sidewalk, the far side of the street, exactly 101 feet from the courthouse steps and, judging from the pictures in the record, approximately 125 feet from the courthouse itself. The question is raised as to whether the failure of the statute to define the word \"near\" renders it unconstitutionally vague. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n. Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 67. It is clear that there is some lack of specificity in a word such as \"near.\"\n1\n While this lack of specificity may not render the statute unconstitutionally vague, at least as applied to a demonstration within the sight and hearing of those in the courthouse,\n2\n it is clear that the statute, with respect to the determination of how near the courthouse a particular demonstration can be, foresees a degree of on-the-spot administrative interpretation by officials charged with responsibility for administering and enforcing it. It is apparent that demonstrators, such as those involved \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 569]\n\u00a0\n here, would justifiably tend to rely on this administrative interpretation of how \"near\" the courthouse a particular demonstration might take place. Louisiana's statutory policy of preserving order around the courthouse would counsel encouragement of just such reliance. This administrative discretion to construe the term \"near\" concerns a limited control of the streets and other areas in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse and is the type of narrow discretion which this Court has recognized as the proper role of responsible officials in making determinations concerning the time, place, duration, and manner of demonstrations. See Cox v. New Hampshire, \n312 \nU.S. 569\n; Poulos v. New Hampshire, \n345 \nU.S. 395\n. See generally the discussion on this point in No. 24, pp. 553-558, ante. It is not the type of unbridled discretion which would allow an official to pick and choose among expressions of view the ones he will permit to use the streets and other public facilities, which we have invalidated in the obstruction of public passages statute as applied in No. 24, ante. Nor does this limited administrative regulation of traffic which the Court has consistently recognized as necessary and permissible, constitute a waiver of law which is beyond the power of the police. Obviously telling demonstrators how far from the courthouse steps is \"near\" the courthouse for purposes of a permissible peaceful demonstration is a far cry from allowing one to commit, for example, murder, or robbery.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe record here clearly shows that the officials present gave permission for the demonstration to take place across the street from the courthouse. Cox testified that they gave him permission to conduct the demonstration \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 570]\n\u00a0\n on the far side of the street. This testimony is not only uncontradicted but is corroborated by the State's witnesses who were present. Police Chief White testified that he told Cox \"he must confine\" the demonstration \"to the west side of the street.\"\n4\n James Erwin, news director of radio station WIBR, agreed that Cox was given permission for the assembly as long as it remained within a designated time. When Sheriff Clemmons sought to break up the demonstration, he first announced, \"now, you have been allowed to demonstrate.\"\n5\n The Sheriff testified that he had \"no objection\" to the students \"being assembled on that side of the street.\" Finally, in its brief before this Court, the State did not contend that permission was not granted. Rather in its statement of the facts and argument it conceded that the officials gave Cox and his group some time to demonstrate across the street from the courthouse. This agreement by the State that in fact permission had been granted to demonstrate across the street from the courthouse - at least for a limited period of time, which the State contends was set at seven minutes - was confirmed by counsel for the State in oral argument before this Court.\n\nThe record shows that at no time did the police recommend, or even suggest, that the demonstration be held further from the courthouse than it actually was. The police admittedly had prior notice that the demonstration was planned to be held in the vicinity of the courthouse. They were prepared for it at that point and so stationed themselves and their equipment as to keep the demonstrators on the far side of the street. As Cox approached \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 571]\n\u00a0\n the vicinity of the courthouse, he was met by the Chief of Police and other officials. At this point not only was it not suggested that they hold their assembly elsewhere, or disband, but they were affirmatively told that they could hold the demonstration on the sidewalk of the far side of the street, 101 feet from the courthouse steps. This area was effectively blocked off by the police and traffic rerouted.\n\nThus, the highest police officials of the city, in the presence of the Sheriff and Mayor, in effect told the demonstrators that they could meet where they did, 101 feet from the courthouse steps, but could not meet closer to the courthouse. In effect, appellant was advised that a demonstration at the place it was held would not be one \"near\" the courthouse within the terms of the statute.\n\nIn Raley v. Ohio, \n360 \nU.S. 423\n, this Court held that the Due Process Clause prevented conviction of persons for refusing to answer questions of a state investigating commission when they relied upon assurances of the commission, either express or implied, that they had a privilege under state law to refuse to answer, though in fact this privilege was not available to them. The situation presented here is analogous to that in Raley, which we deem to be controlling. As in Raley, under all the circumstances of this case, after the public officials acted as they did, to sustain appellant's later conviction for demonstrating where they told him he could \"would be to sanction an indefensible sort of entrapment by the State - convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State had clearly told him was available to him.\" Id., at 426. The Due Process Clause does not permit convictions to be obtained under such circumstances.\n\nThis is not to say that had the appellant, entirely on his own, held the demonstration across the street from the courthouse within the sight and hearing of those \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 572]\n\u00a0\n inside, or a fortiori, had he defied an order of the police requiring him to hold this demonstration at some point further away out of the sight and hearing of those inside the courthouse, we would reverse the conviction as in this case. In such cases a state interpretation of the statute to apply to the demonstration as being \"near\" the courthouse would be subject to quite different considerations. See p. 568, supra.\n\nThere remains just one final point: the effect of the Sheriff's order to disperse. The State in effect argues that this order somehow removed the prior grant of permission and reliance on the officials' construction that the demonstration on the far side of the street was not illegal as being \"near\" the courthouse. This, however, we cannot accept. Appellant was led to believe that his demonstration on the far side of the street violated no statute. He was expressly ordered to leave, not because he was peacefully demonstrating too near the courthouse, nor because a time limit originally set had expired, but because officials erroneously concluded that what he said threatened a breach of the peace. This is apparent from the face of the Sheriff's statement when he ordered the meeting dispersed: \"Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your demonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of the law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be broken up immediately.\" See discussion in No. 24, ante, at 545-551. Appellant correctly conceived, as we have held in No. 24, ante, that this was not a valid reason for the dispersal order. He therefore was still justified in his continued belief that because of the original official grant of permission he had a right to stay where he was for the few additional minutes required to conclude the meeting. In addition, even if we were to accept the State's version that the sole reason for terminating the demonstration \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 573]\n\u00a0\n was that appellant exceeded the narrow time limits\n6\n set by the police, his conviction could not be sustained. Assuming the place of the meeting was appropriate - as appellant justifiably concluded from the official grant of permission - nothing in this courthouse statute, nor in the breach of the peace or obstruction of public passages statutes with their broad sweep and application that we have condemned in No. 24, ante, at 553-558, authorizes the police to draw the narrow time line, unrelated to any policy of these statutes, that would be approved if we were to sustain appellant's conviction on this ground. Indeed, the allowance of such unfettered discretion in the police would itself constitute a procedure such as that condemned in No. 24, ante, at 553-558. In any event, as we have stated, it is our conclusion from the record that the dispersal order had nothing to do with any time or place limitation, and thus, on this ground alone, it is clear that the dispersal order did not remove the protection accorded appellant by the original grant of permission.\n\nOf course this does not mean that the police cannot call a halt to a meeting which though originally peaceful, becomes violent. Nor does it mean that, under properly drafted and administered statutes and ordinances, the authorities cannot set reasonable time limits for assemblies related to the policies of such laws and then order them dispersed when these time limits are exceeded. See the discussion in No. 24, ante, at 553-558. We merely hold that, under circumstances such as those present in this case, appellant's conviction cannot be sustained on the basis of the dispersal order. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNothing we have said here or in No. 24, ante, is to be interpreted as sanctioning riotous conduct in any form or demonstrations, however peaceful their conduct or commendable their motives, which conflict with properly drawn statutes and ordinances designed to promote law and order, protect the community against disorder, regulate traffic, safeguard legitimate interests in private and public property, or protect the administration of justice and other essential governmental functions.\n\nLiberty can only be exercised in a system of law which safeguards order. We reaffirm the repeated holdings of this Court that our constitutional command of free speech and assembly is basic and fundamental and encompasses peaceful social protest, so important to the preservation of the freedoms treasured in a democratic society. We also reaffirm the repeated decisions of this Court that there is no place for violence in a democratic society dedicated to liberty under law, and that the right of peaceful protest does not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may do so at any time and at any place. There is a proper time and place for even the most peaceful protest and a plain duty and responsibility on the part of all citizens to obey all valid laws and regulations. There is an equally plain requirement for laws and regulations to be drawn so as to give citizens fair warning as to what is illegal; for regulation of conduct that involves freedom of speech and assembly not to be so broad in scope as to stifle First Amendment freedoms, which \"need breathing space to survive,\" NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 433\n; for appropriate limitations on the discretion of public officials where speech and assembly are intertwined with regulated conduct; and for all such laws and regulations to be applied with an equal hand. We believe that all of these requirements can be met in an ordered society dedicated to liberty. We reaffirm our conviction that \"[f]reedom and viable government \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 575]\n\u00a0\n are . . . indivisible concepts.\" Gibson v. Florida Legislative Comm., \n372 \nU.S. 539, 546\n.\n\nThe application of these principles requires us to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is to be contrasted, for example, with the express limitation proscribing certain acts within 500 feet of foreign embassies, legations, or consulates within the District of Columbia. 52 Stat. 30 (1938); D.C.

App. 41, 24 P.2d 965.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is true that the Police Chief testified that he did not subjectively intend to grant permission, but there is no evidence at all that this subjective state of mind was ever communicated to appellant, or in fact to anyone else present.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See p. 572, infra, for the Sheriff's full statement at this time.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] As we have pointed out in No. 24, ante, at 541, n. 2, the evidence is conflicting as to whether appellant and his group were given only a limited time to hold their meeting and whether, if so, such a time limit was exceeded.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring in No. 24 and dissenting in No. 49.\n\nI concur in the Court's judgment reversing appellant Cox's convictions for violation of the Louisiana statutes prohibiting breach of the peace and obstructing public passages, but I do so for reasons which differ somewhat from those stated in the Court's opinion. I therefore deem it appropriate to state separately my reasons for voting to hold both these statutes unconstitutional and to reverse the convictions under them. On the other hand, I have no doubt that the State has power to protect judges, jurors, witnesses, and court officers from intimidation by crowds which seek to influence them by picketing, patrolling, or parading in or near the court-houses in which they do their business or the homes in which they live, and I therefore believe that the Louisiana statute which protects the administration of justice by forbidding such interferences is constitutional, both as written and as applied. Since I believe that the evidence showed practically without dispute that appellant violated this statute, I think this conviction should be affirmed.\n\nThere was ample evidence for the jury to have found the following to be the facts: On December 14, 1961, 23 persons were arrested and put in jail on a charge of illegal picketing. That night appellant Cox and others made plans to carry on a \"demonstration,\" that is, a parade and march, through parts of Baton Rouge, ending at the courthouse. Their purpose was to \"protest\" \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 576]\n\u00a0\n against what they called the \"illegal arrest\" of the 23 picketers. They neither sought nor obtained any permit for such a use of the streets. The next morning, December 15, the plan was carried out. Some 2,000 protesters marched to a point 101 feet across the street from the courthouse, which also contained the jail. State and county police officers, for reasons as to which there was a conflict in the evidence from which different inferences could be drawn, agreed that the picketers might stay there for a few minutes. The group sang songs along with the prisoners in the jail and did other things set out in the Court's opinion. Later state and county officials told Cox, the group's leader, that the crowd had to \"move on.\" Cox told his followers to stay where they were and they did. Officers then used tear gas and the picketers ran away. Cox was later arrested.\n\n  I. THE BREACH-OF-PEACE CONVICTION.\n\n\n I agree with that part of the Court's opinion holding that the Louisiana breach-of-the-peace statute\n1\n on its face and as construed by the State Supreme Court is so broad \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 577]\n\u00a0\n as to be unconstitutionally vague under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507, 509\n-510. The statute does not itself define the conditions upon which people who want to express views may be allowed to use the public streets and highways, but leaves this to be defined by law enforcement officers. The statute therefore neither forbids all crowds to congregate and picket on streets, nor is it narrowly drawn to prohibit congregating or patrolling under certain clearly defined conditions while preserving the freedom to speak of those who are using the streets as streets in the ordinary way that the State permits. A state statute of either of the two types just mentioned, regulating conduct - patrolling and marching - as distinguished from speech, would in my judgment be constitutional, subject only to the condition that if such a law had the effect of indirectly impinging on freedom of speech, press, or religion, it would be unconstitutional if under the circumstances it appeared that the State's interest in suppressing the conduct was not sufficient to outweigh the individual's interest in engaging in conduct closely involving his First Amendment freedoms. As this Court held in Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n:\n\n \"Mere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting  matters of public convenience may well support regulation  directed at other personal activities, but be  insufficient to justify such as diminishes the exercise  of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic  institutions. And so, as cases arise, the delicate and  difficult task falls upon the courts to weigh the circumstances  and to appraise the substantiality of the  reasons advanced in support of the regulation of the  free enjoyment of the rights.\"\n\n\n See also, e. g., Brotherhood of R. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, \n377 \nU.S. 1\n; NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415\n; NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 578]\n\u00a0\n \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; Martin v. City of Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141\n; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; Lovell v. City of Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n. As I discussed at length in my dissenting opinion in Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 141\n-142, when passing on the validity of a regulation of conduct, which may indirectly infringe on free speech, this Court does, and I agree that it should, \"weigh the circumstances\" in order to protect, not to destroy, freedom of speech, press, and religion.\n\nThe First and Fourteenth Amendments, I think, take away from government, state and federal, all power to restrict freedom of speech, press, and assembly where people have a right to be for such purposes. This does not mean, however, that these amendments also grant a constitutional right to engage in the conduct of picketing or patrolling, whether on publicly owned streets or on privately owned property. See Labor Board v. Fruit & Vegetable Packers & Warehousemen, \n377 \nU.S. 58, 76\n (concurring opinion). Were the law otherwise, people on the streets, in their homes and anywhere else could be compelled to listen against their will to speakers they did not want to hear. Picketing, though it may be utilized to communicate ideas, is not speech, and therefore is not of itself protected by the First Amendment. Hughes v. Superior Court, \n339 \nU.S. 460, 464\n-466; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n; Bakery & Pastry Drivers & Helpers v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769, 775\n-777 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).\n\nHowever, because Louisiana's breach-of-peace statute is not narrowly drawn to assure nondiscriminatory application, I think it is constitutionally invalid under our holding in Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229\n. See also Musser v. Utah, \n333 \nU.S. 95, 96\n-97. Edwards, however, as I understand it, did not hold that either private property owners or the States are constitutionally required \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 579]\n\u00a0\n to supply a place for people to exercise freedom of speech or assembly. See Bell v. Maryland, \n378 \nU.S. 226, 344\n-346 (dissenting opinion). What Edwards as I read it did hold, and correctly I think, was not that the Federal Constitution prohibited South Carolina from making it unlawful for people to congregate, picket, and parade on or near that State's capitol grounds, but rather that in the absence of a clear, narrowly drawn, nondiscriminatory statute prohibiting such gatherings and picketing, South Carolina could not punish people for assembling at the capitol to petition for redress of grievances. In the case before us Louisiana has by a broad, vague statute given policemen an unlimited power to order people off the streets, not to enforce a specific, nondiscriminatory state statute forbidding patrolling and picketing, but rather whenever a policeman makes a decision on his own personal judgment that views being expressed on the street are provoking or might provoke a breach of the peace. Such a statute does not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat. Compare Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n-370. This kind of statute provides a perfect device to arrest people whose views do not suit the policeman or his superiors, while leaving free to talk anyone with whose views the police agree. See Feiner v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 315, 321\n (dissenting opinion); cf. Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 349\n-350 (concurring opinion); Barsky v. Board of Regents, \n347 \nU.S. 442, 463\n-464 (dissenting opinion); Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206, 217\n-218 (dissenting opinion); Ludecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S. 160, 173\n (dissenting opinion). In this situation I think Edwards v. South Carolina and other such cases invalidating statutes for vagueness are controlling. Moreover, because the statute makes an exception for labor organizations and therefore tries to limit access to \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 580]\n\u00a0\n the streets to some views but not others, I believe it is unconstitutional for the reasons discussed in Part II of this opinion, dealing with the street-obstruction statute, infra. For all the reasons stated I concur in reversing the conviction based on the breach-of-peace statute.\n\n  II. THE OBSTRUCTING-PUBLIC-PASSAGES     CONVICTION.\n\n\n The Louisiana law against obstructing the streets and sidewalks,\n2\n while applied here so as to convict Negroes for assembling and picketing on streets and sidewalks for the purpose of publicly protesting racial discrimination, expressly provides that the statute shall not bar picketing and assembly by labor unions protesting unfair treatment of union members. I believe that the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that if the streets of a town are open to some views, they must be open to all. It is worth noting in passing that the objectives of labor unions and of the group led by Cox here may have much in common. Both frequently protest discrimination against their members in the matter of employment. Compare New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552, 561\n. This Louisiana law opens the streets for union assembly, picketing, and \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 581]\n\u00a0\n public advocacy, while denying that opportunity to groups protesting against racial discrimination. As I said above, I have no doubt about the general power of Louisiana to bar all picketing on its streets and highways. Standing, patrolling, or marching back and forth on streets is conduct, not speech, and as conduct can be regulated or prohibited. But by specifically permitting picketing for the publication of labor union views, Louisiana is attempting to pick and choose among the views it is willing to have discussed on its streets. It thus is trying to prescribe by law what matters of public interest people whom it allows to assemble on its streets may and may not discuss. This seems to me to be censorship in a most odious form, unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. And to deny this appellant and his group use of the streets because of their views against racial discrimination, while allowing other groups to use the streets to voice opinions on other subjects, also amounts, I think, to an invidious discrimination forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n3\n Moreover, as the Court points out, city officials despite this statute apparently have permitted favored groups other than labor unions to block the streets with their gatherings. For these reasons I concur in reversing the conviction based on this law.\n\n  III. THE CONVICTION FOR PICKETING NEAR A     COURTHOUSE.\n\n\n I would sustain the conviction of appellant for violation of Louisiana's Rev. Stat. 14:401 (Cum. Supp. 1962), which makes it an offense for anyone, under any conditions, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 582]\n\u00a0\n to picket or parade near a courthouse, residence or other building used by a judge, juror, witness, or court officer, \"with the intent of influencing\" any of them.\n4\n Certainly the record shows beyond all doubt that the purpose of the 2,000 or more people who stood right across the street from the courthouse and jail was to protest the arrest of members of their group who were then in jail. As the Court's opinion states, appellant Cox so testified. Certainly the most obvious reason for their protest at the courthouse was to influence the judge and other court officials who used the courthouse and performed their official duties there. The Court attempts to support its holding by its inference that the Chief of Police gave his consent to picketing the courthouse. But quite apart from the fact that a police chief cannot authorize violations of his State's criminal laws,\n5\n there was strong, emphatic testimony that if any consent was given it was limited to telling Cox and his group to come no closer to the courthouse than they had already come without the consent of any official, city, state, or federal. And there was also testimony that when told to leave appellant Cox defied the order by telling the crowd not to move. I fail to understand how the Court can justify the reversal of this conviction \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 583]\n\u00a0\n because of a permission which testimony in the record denies was given, which could not have been authoritatively given anyway, and which even if given was soon afterwards revoked. While I agree that the record does not show boisterous or violent conduct or indecent language on the part of the \"demonstrators,\" the ample evidence that this group planned the march on the courthouse and carried it out for the express purpose of influencing the courthouse officials in the performance of their official duties brings this case squarely within the prohibitions of the Louisiana statute and I think leaves us with no alternative but to sustain the conviction unless the statute itself is unconstitutional, and I do not believe that this statute is unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied.\n\nThis statute, like the federal one which it closely resembles,\n6\n was enacted to protect courts and court officials from the intimidation and dangers that inhere in huge gatherings at courthouse doors and jail doors to protest arrests and to influence court officials in performing their duties. The very purpose of a court system is to adjudicate controversies, both criminal and civil, in the calmness and solemnity of the courtroom according to legal procedures. Justice cannot be rightly administered, nor are the lives and safety of prisoners secure, where throngs of people clamor against the processes of justice right outside the courthouse or jailhouse doors. The streets are not now and never have been the proper place to administer justice. Use of the streets for such purposes has always proved disastrous to individual liberty in the long run, whatever fleeting benefits may have appeared to have been achieved. And minority groups, I venture to suggest, are the ones who always have suffered and always will suffer most when street multitudes are allowed to substitute \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 584]\n\u00a0\n their pressures for the less glamorous but more dependable and temperate processes of the law. Experience demonstrates that it is not a far step from what to many seems the earnest, honest, patriotic, kind-spirited multitude of today, to the fanatical, threatening, lawless mob of tomorrow. And the crowds that press in the streets for noble goals today can be supplanted tomorrow by street mobs pressuring the courts for precisely opposite ends.\n\nMinority groups in particular need always to bear in mind that the Constitution, while it requires States to treat all citizens equally and protect them in the exercise of rights granted by the Federal Constitution and laws, does not take away the State's power, indeed its duty, to keep order and to do justice according to law. Those who encourage minority groups to believe that the United States Constitution and federal laws give them a right to patrol and picket in the streets whenever they choose, in order to advance what they think to be a just and noble end, do no service to those minority groups, their cause, or their country. I am confident from this record that this appellant violated the Louisiana statute because of a mistaken belief that he and his followers had a constitutional right to do so, because of what they believed were just grievances. But the history of the past 25 years if it shows nothing else shows that his group's constitutional and statutory rights have to be protected by the courts, which must be kept free from intimidation and coercive pressures of any kind. Government under law as ordained by our Constitution is too precious, too sacred, to be jeopardized by subjecting the courts to intimidatory practices that have been fatal to individual liberty and minority rights wherever and whenever such practices have been allowed to poison the streams of justice. I would be wholly unwilling to join in moving this country a single step in that direction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] La. Rev. Stat. 14:103.1 (Cum. Supp. 1962) provides in relevant part:\n\n\"Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby: (1) crowds or congregates with others, providing however nothing herein contained shall apply to a bona fide legitimate labor organization or to any of its legal activities such as picketing, lawful assembly or concerted activity in the interest of its members for the purpose of accomplishing or securing more favorable wage standards, hours of employment and working conditions, in or upon . . . a public street or public highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building . . . and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on, or disperse or move on, when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person . . . shall be guilty of disturbing the peace. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] La.

Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 225\n-227.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 18 U.S.C. 1507 (1958 ed.). \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 585]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring in No. 24 and dissenting in No. 49.\n\nAccording to the record, the opinions of all of Louisiana's courts and even the majority opinion of this Court, the appellant, in an effort to influence and intimidate the courts and legal officials of Baton Rouge and procure the release of 23 prisoners being held for trial, agitated and led a mob of over 2,000 students in the staging of a modern Donnybrook Fair across from the courthouse and jail. He preferred to resolve the controversy in the streets rather than submit the question to the normal judicial procedures by contracting the judge and attempting to secure bail and an early trial for the prisoners.\n\nLouisiana's statute, 14:401, under attack here, was taken in haec verba from a bill which became 18 U.S.C. 1507 (1958 ed.). The federal statute was enacted by the Congress in 1950 to protect federal courts from demonstrations similar to the one involved in this case. It applies to the Supreme Court Building where this Court sits. I understand that 1507 was written by members of this Court after disturbances similar to the one here occurred at buildings housing federal courts. Naturally, the Court could hardly be expected to hold its progeny invalid either on the ground that the use in the statute of the phrase \"in or near a building housing a court\" was vague or that it violated free speech or assembly. It has been said that an author is always pleased with his own work.\n\nBut the Court excuses Cox's brazen defiance of the statute - the validity of which the Court upholds - on a much more subtle ground. It seizes upon the acquiescence of the Chief of Police arising from the laudable motive to avoid violence and possible bloodshed to find that he made an on-the-spot administrative determination that a demonstration confined to the west side of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 586]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis Street - 101 feet from the courthouse steps - would not be \"near\" enough to the court building to violate the statute. It then holds that the arrest and conviction of appellant for demonstrating there constitutes an \"indefensible sort of entrapment,\" citing Raley v. Ohio, \n360 \nU.S. 423\n (1959).\n\nWith due deference, the record will not support this novel theory. Nor is Raley apposite. This mob of young Negroes led by Cox - 2,000 strong - was not only within sight but in hearing distance of the courthouse. The record is replete with evidence that the demonstrators with their singing, cheering, clapping and waving of banners drew the attention of the whole courthouse square as well as the occupants and officials of the court building itself. Indeed, one judge was obliged to leave the building. The 23 students who had been arrested for sit-in demonstrations the day before and who were in custody in the building were also aroused to such an extent that they sang and cheered to the demonstrators from the jail which was in the courthouse and the demonstrators returned the notice with like activity. The law enforcement officials were confronted with a direct obstruction to the orderly administration of their duties as well as an interference with the courts. One hardly needed an on-the-spot administrative decision that the demonstration was \"near\" the courthouse with the disturbance being conducted before the eyes and ringing in the ears of court officials, police officers and citizens throughout the courthouse.\n\nMoreover, the Chief testified that when Cox and the 2,000 Negroes approached him on the way to the courthouse he was faced with a \"situation that was accomplished.\" From the beginning they had been told not to proceed with their march; twice officers had requested them to turn back to the school; on each occasion they had refused. Finding that he could not stop them without \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 587]\n\u00a0\n the use of force the Chief told Cox that he must confine the demonstration to the west side of St. Louis Street across from the courthouse.\n\nAll the witnesses, including the appellant, state that the time for the demonstration was expressly limited. The State's witnesses say seven minutes, while Cox claims his speech was to be seven minutes but the program would take from 17 to 25 minutes. Regardless of the amount of time agreed upon, it is a novel construction of the facts to say that the grant of permission to demonstrate for a limited period of time was an administrative determination that the west side of the street was not \"near\" the courthouse. This implies that the amount of time might somehow be relevant in deciding whether an activity is within the prohibitions of the statute. The inclusion of a time limitation is, to me, entirely inconsistent with the view that an administrative determination was made. The only way the Court can support its finding is to ignore the time limitation and hold - as it does sub silentio - that once Cox and the 2,000 demonstrators were permitted to occupy the sidewalk they could remain indefinitely. Once the administrative determination was made that the west side of St. Louis Street was not so close to the courthouse as to violate the statute it could not be later drawn within the prohibited zone by Cox's refusal to leave. Thus the 2,000 demonstrators must be allowed to remain there unless in the meanwhile some other statute empowers the State to eject them. This, I submit, is a complete frustration of the power of the State.\n\nBecause I am unable to agree that the word \"near,\" when applied to the facts of this case, required an administrative interpretation, and since I feel that the record refutes the conclusion that it was made, I must respectfully dissent from such a finding. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor can I follow the Court's logic when it holds that the case is controlled by Raley v. Ohio, supra. In Raley the petitioners whose convictions were reversed were told that they had a right to exercise their privilege and refuse to answer questions propounded to them in an orderly way during the conduct of a hearing. The administrative determination upon which this Court turns the present case was in actuality made, if at all, in the heat of a racial demonstration in a southern city for the sole purpose of avoiding what had the potentialities of a race riot. In Raley, there was no large crowd of 2,000 demonstrators endangering a tenuous racial peace. Indeed, the petitioners in Raley might well have chosen to waive their privilege and not be subject to prosecution at all but for the advice tendered them by those conducting the hearing. Here the demonstrators were determined to go to the courthouse regardless of what the officials told them regarding the legality of their acts. Here, like the one petitioner in Raley whose conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court, appellant never relied on the advice or determination of the officer. The demonstration, as I have previously noted, was a fait accompli. In view of these distinctions, I can see no enticement or encouragement by agents of the State sufficient to establish a Raley-type entrapment.\n\nAnd even though arguendo one admits that the Chief's action was an administrative determination, I cannot see how the Court can hold it binding on the State. It certainly was not made in the free exercise of his discretion.\n\nReading the facts in a way most favorable to the appellant would, in my opinion, establish only that the Chief of Police consented to the demonstration at that location. However, if the Chief's action be consent, I never knew until today that a law enforcement official - city, state or national - could forgive a breach of the criminal laws. I missed that in my law school, in my practice and for \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 589]\n\u00a0\n the two years while I was head of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n\nI have always been taught that this Nation was dedicated to freedom under law not under mobs, whether they be integrationists or white supremacists. Our concept of equal justice under law encompasses no such protection as the Court gives Cox today. The contemporary drive for personal liberty can only be successful when conducted within the framework of due process of law. Goals, no matter how laudable, pursued by mobocracy in the end must always lead to further restraints of free expression. To permit, and even condone, the use of such anarchistic devices to influence the administration of justice can but lead us to disaster. For the Court to place its imprimatur upon it is a misfortune that those who love the law will always regret.\n\nI must, therefore, respectfully dissent from this action and join my Brother BLACK on this facet of the case. I also agree with him that the statute prohibiting obstruction of public passages is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.\n1\n And, as will be seen, I arrive at the same conclusion for the same reason on the question regarding the breach of the peace statute. However, I cannot agree that the latter Act is unconstitutionally vague.\n\nThe statute declares congregating \"with intent to provoke a breach of the peace\" and refusing to disperse after being ordered so to do by an officer to be an offense. Each of these elements is set out in clear and unequivocal language. Certainly the language in the present statute is no more vague than that in the New York statute which was challenged on vagueness grounds in Feiner v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 315\n.\n2\n There the Court upheld \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 590]\n\u00a0\n Feiner's conviction on a disorderly conduct charge. I concur completely in the Court's statement that the present case is a \"far cry from the situation\" presented in Feiner.\n\n\"There the demonstration was conducted by only one person and the crowd was limited to approximately 80, as compared with the present lineup of some [2,000] demonstrators and 250. onlookers. . . . Perhaps [appellant's] speech was not so animated but in this setting their actions . . . created a much greater danger of riot and disorder. It is my belief that anyone conversant with the almost spontaneous combustion in some Southern communities in such a situation will agree that the [Sheriff's] action may well have averted a major catastrophe.\" Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229, 243\n-244 (dissenting opinion of CLARK, J.).\n\n\n Nor can I agree that the instant case is controlled by either Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, or Fields v. South Carolina, \n375 \nU.S. 44\n (1963). Both went off on their peculiar facts and neither dealt with a situation like the one here before the Court. Moreover, Edwards and Fields involved convictions for common-law breach of the peace and not violation of a statute.\n\nIn any event, I believe the language of the breach of the peace statute is as free from ambiguity or vagueness \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 591]\n\u00a0\n as is the statute prohibiting picketing of a courthouse which the Court today upholds. There the relevant words are parading \"in or near a building housing a court of the State . . .\" with the intent of obstructing justice. Certainly, both of the statutes are as clear as the words \"below cost\" which this Court approved in United States v. National Dairy Products, \n372 \nU.S. 29\n (1963), and cases there cited.\n\nHowever, because this statute contains an express exclusion for the activities of labor unions, I would hold the statute unconstitutional on the equal protection ground my Brother BLACK enunciated with regard to the statute condemning obstruction of public passages.\n\nOn these grounds I dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Parts I and II of his opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 722 of the Penal Law of New York in effect at that time stated:\n\n\"Any person who with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned, commits any of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 590]\n\u00a0\n the following acts shall be deemed to have committed the offense of disorderly conduct:\n\n\n\"1. Uses offensive, disorderly, threatening, abusive or insulting language, conduct or behavior;\n\n\n\"2. Acts in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others;\n\n\n\"3. Congregates with others on a public street and refuses to move on when ordered by the police;\n\n\n\"4. By his actions causes a crowd to collect, except when lawfully addressing such a crowd.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nIn No. 49, I agree with the dissent filed by my Brother BLACK in Part III of his opinion. In No. 24, although I do not agree with everything the Court says concerning the breach of peace conviction, particularly its statement concerning the unqualified protection to be extended to Cox's exhortations to engage in sit-ins in restaurants, I agree that the conviction for breach of peace is governed by Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229\n, and must be reversed.\n\nRegretfully, I also dissent from the reversal of the conviction for obstruction of public passages. The Louisiana statute is not invalidated on its face but only in its application. But this remarkable emasculation of a prohibitory statute is based on only very vague evidence that other meetings and parades have been allowed by the authorities. The sole indication in the record from the state court that such has occurred was contained in the testimony of the Chief of Police who, in the process of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 592]\n\u00a0\n pointing out that Cox and his group had not announced the fact or purpose of their meeting, said \"most organizations that want to hold a parade or a meeting of any kind, they have no reluctance to evidence their desires at the start.\" There is no evidence in the record that other meetings of this magnitude had been allowed on the city streets, had been allowed in the vicinity of the courthouse or had been permitted completely to obstruct the sidewalk and to block access to abutting buildings. Indeed, the sheriff testified that \"we have never had such a demonstration since I have been in law enforcement in this parish.\" He also testified that \"any other organization\" would have received the same treatment if it \"had conducted such a demonstration in front of the Parish Court-house,\" whether it had been \"colored or white, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, any kind of organization, if they had conducted this same type of demonstration . . . .\" Similarly the trial judge noted that although Louisiana respects freedom of speech and the right to picket, Louisiana courts \"have held that picketing is unlawful when it is mass picketing.\"\n\nAt the oral argument in response to MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG'S question as to whether parades and demonstrations are allowed in Baton Rouge, counsel said, \"arrangements are usually made depending on the size of the demonstration, of course, arrangements are made with the officials and their cooperation is not only required it is needed where you have such a large crowd.\" In my view, however, all of this evidence together falls far short of justification for converting this prohibitory state statute into an open-ended licensing statute invalid under prior decisions of this Court as applied to this case. This is particularly true since the Court's approach is its own invention and has not been urged or litigated by the parties either in this Court or the courts below. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 593]\n\u00a0\n Certainly the parties have had no opportunity to develop or to refute the factual basis underlying the Court's rationale.\n\nUnder the Court's broad, rather uncritical approach it would seem unavoidable that these same demonstrators could have met in the middle of any street during the rush hour or could have extended their meeting at any location hour after hour, day after day, without risking any action under this statute for interfering with the normal use of the streets and sidewalks. I doubt that this bizarre intrusion into local management of public streets is either required or justified by the prior cases in this Court.\n\nFurthermore, even if the obstruction statute, because of prior permission granted to others, could not be applied in this case so as to prevent the demonstration, it does not necessarily follow that the federal license to use the streets is unlimited as to time and circumstance. Two thousand people took possession of the sidewalk in an entire city block. Building entrances were blocked and normal use of the sidewalk was impossible. If the crowd was entitled to obstruct in order to demonstrate as the Court holds, it is nevertheless unnecessary to hold that the demonstration and the obstruction could continue ad infinitum. Here the demonstration was permitted to proceed for the period of time that the demonstrators had requested. When they were asked to disband, Cox twice refused. If he could refuse at this point I think he could refuse at any later time as well. But in my view at some point the authorities were entitled to apply the statute and to clear the streets. That point was reached here. To reverse the conviction under these circumstances makes it only rhetoric to talk of local power to control the streets under a properly drawn ordinance. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 559, 594]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOX v. LOUISIANA(1965)\nNo. 24\nArgued: October 21, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appellant was the leader of a civil rights demonstration in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of 2,000 Negro students protesting segregation and the arrest and imprisonment the previous day of other Negro students who had participated in a protest against racial segregation. The group assembled a few blocks from the courthouse, where appellant identified himself to officers as the group's leader and explained the purpose of the demonstration. Following his refusal to disband the group, appellant led it in an orderly march toward the courthouse. In the vicinity of the courthouse officers stopped appellant who, after explaining the purpose and program of the demonstration, was told by the Police Chief that he could hold the meeting so long as he confined it to the west side of the street. Appellant directed the group to the west sidewalk, across the street from the courthouse and 101 feet from its steps. There the group, standing five feet deep and occupying almost the entire block but not obstructing the street, displayed signs and sang songs which evoked response from the students in the courthouse jail. Appellant addressed the group. The Sheriff, construing as inflammatory appellant's concluding exhortation to the students to \"sit in\" at uptown lunch counters, ordered dispersal of the group which, not being directly forthcoming, was effected by tear gas. Appellant was arrested the next day and was convicted of peace disturbance, obstructing public passages, and courthouse picketing. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the convictions, two of which (peace disturbance and obstructing public passages) are involved in this case; the third (courthouse picketing) being involved in No. 49, post, at 559. Held:\n\n 1.

The breach of the peace statute is unconstitutionally vague in its overly broad scope, for Louisiana has defined \"breach of the peace\" as \"to agitate, to arouse from a state of repose, to molest, to interrupt, to hinder, to disquiet\"; yet one of the very functions of free speech is to invite dispute.

Roy argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Jack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellant, the Reverend Mr. B. Elton Cox, the leader of a civil rights demonstration, was arrested and charged \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n with four offenses under Louisiana law - criminal conspiracy, disturbing the peace, obstructing public passages, and picketing before a courthouse. In a consolidated trial before a judge without a jury, and on the same set of facts, he was acquitted of criminal conspiracy but convicted of the other three offenses. He was sentenced to serve four months in jail and pay a $200 fine for disturbing the peace, to serve five months in jail and pay a $500 fine for obstructing public passages, and to serve one year in jail and pay a $5,000 fine for picketing before a courthouse. The sentences were cumulative.\n\nIn accordance with Louisiana procedure, the Louisiana Supreme Court reviewed the \"disturbing the peace\" and \"obstructing public passages\" convictions on certiorari, and the \"courthouse picketing\" conviction on appeal. The Louisiana court, in two judgments, affirmed all three convictions. 244 La. 1087, 156 So.2d 448; 245 La. 303, 158 So.2d 172. Appellant filed two separate appeals to this Court from these judgments contending that the three statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional on their face and as applied. We noted probable jurisdiction of both appeals, \n377 \nU.S. 921\n. This case, No. 24, involves the convictions for disturbing the peace and obstructing public passages, and No. 49 concerns the conviction for picketing before a courthouse.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n    THE FACTS.\n\n\n On December 14, 1961, 23 students from Southern University, a Negro college, were arrested in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for picketing stores that maintained segregated lunch counters. This picketing, urging a boycott of those stores, was part of a general protest movement against racial segregation, directed by the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, a civil rights \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n organization. The appellant, an ordained Congregational minister, the Reverend Mr. B. Elton Cox, a Field Secretary of CORE, was an advisor to this movement. On the evening of December 14, appellant and Ronnie Moore, student president of the local CORE chapter, spoke at a mass meeting at the college. The students resolved to demonstrate the next day in front of the courthouse in protest of segregation and the arrest and imprisonment of the picketers who were being held in the parish jail located on the upper floor of the courthouse building.\n\nThe next morning about 2,000 students left the campus, which was located approximately five miles from downtown Baton Rouge. Most of them had to walk into the city since the drivers of their busses were arrested. Moore was also arrested at the entrance to the campus while parked in a car equipped with a loudspeaker, and charged with violation of an antinoise statute. Because Moore was immediately taken off to jail and the vice president of the CORE chapter was already in jail for picketing, Cox felt it his duty to take over the demonstration and see that it was carried out as planned. He quickly drove to the city \"to pick up this leadership and keep things orderly.\"\n\nWhen Cox arrived, 1,500 of the 2,000 students were assembling at the site of the old State Capitol building, two and one-half blocks from the courthouse. Cox walked up and down cautioning the students to keep to one side of the sidewalk while getting ready for their march to the courthouse. The students circled the block in a file two or three abreast occupying about half of the sidewalk. The police had learned of the proposed demonstration the night before from news media and other sources. Captain Font of the City Police Department and Chief Kling of the Sheriff's office, two high-ranking subordinate officials, approached the group and spoke to Cox at the northeast corner of the capitol \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n grounds. Cox identified himself as the group's leader, and, according to Font and Kling, he explained that the students were demonstrating to protest \"the illegal arrest of some of their people who were being held in jail.\" The version of Cox and his witnesses throughout was that they came not \"to protest just the arrest but . . . [also] to protest the evil of discrimination.\" Kling asked Cox to disband the group and \"take them back from whence they came.\" Cox did not acquiesce in this request but told the officers that they would march by the courthouse, say prayers, sing hymns, and conduct a peaceful program of protest. The officer repeated his request to disband, and Cox again refused. Kling and Font then returned to their car in order to report by radio to the Sheriff and Chief of Police who were in the immediate vicinity; while this was going on, the students, led by Cox, began their walk toward the courthouse.\n\nThey walked in an orderly and peaceful file, two or three abreast, one block east, stopping on the way for a red traffic light. In the center of this block they were joined by another group of students. The augmented group now totaling about 2,000\n1\n turned the corner and proceeded south, coming to a halt in the next block opposite the courthouse.\n\nAs Cox, still at the head of the group, approached the vicinity of the courthouse, he was stopped by Captain Font and Inspector Trigg and brought to Police Chief Wingate White, who was standing in the middle of St. Louis Street. The Chief then inquired as to the purpose of the demonstration. Cox, reading from a prepared paper, outlined his program to White, stating that it would include a singing of the Star Spangled Banner \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n and a \"freedom song,\" recitation of the Lord's Prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, and a short speech. White testified that he told Cox that \"he must confine\" the demonstration \"to the west side of the street.\" White added, \"This, of course, was not - I didn't mean it in the import that I was giving him any permission to do it, but I was presented with a situation that was accomplished, and I had to make a decision.\" Cox testified that the officials agreed to permit the meeting. James Erwin, news director of radio station WIBR, a witness for the State, was present and overheard the conversation. He testified that \"My understanding was that they would be allowed to demonstrate if they stayed on the west side of the street and stayed within the recognized time,\"\n2\n and that this was \"agreed to\" by White.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe students were then directed by Cox to the west sidewalk, across the street from the courthouse, 101 feet from its steps. They were lined up on this sidewalk about five deep and spread almost the entire length of the block. The group did not obstruct the street. It was close to noon and, being lunch time, a small crowd of 100 to 300 curious white people, mostly courthouse personnel, gathered on the east sidewalk and courthouse steps, about 100 feet from the demonstrators. Seventy-five to eighty policemen, including city and state patrolmen and members of the Sheriff's staff, as well as members of the fire department and a fire truck were stationed in the street between the two groups. Rain fell throughout the demonstration. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeveral of the students took from beneath their coats picket signs similar to those which had been used the day before. These signs bore legends such as \"Don't buy discrimination for Christmas,\" \"Sacrifice for Christ, don't buy,\" and named stores which were proclaimed \"unfair.\" They then sang \"God Bless America,\" pledged allegiance to the flag, prayed briefly, and sang one or two hymns, including \"We Shall Overcome.\" The 23 students, who were locked in jail cells in the courthouse building out of the sight of the demonstrators, responded by themselves singing; this in turn was greeted with cheers and applause by the demonstrators. Appellant gave a speech, described by a State's witness as follows:\n\n\"He said that in effect that it was a protest against the illegal arrest of some of their members and that other people were allowed to picket . . . and he said that they were not going to commit any violence,\n4\n that if anyone spit on them, they would not spit back on the person that did it.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n Cox then said:\n\n\"All right. It's lunch time. Let's go eat. There are twelve stores we are protesting. A number of these stores have twenty counters; they accept your money from nineteen. They won't accept it from the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 543]\n\u00a0\n twentieth counter. This is an act of racial discrimination. These stores are open to the public. You are members of the public. We pay taxes to the Federal Government and you who live here pay taxes to the State.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n In apparent reaction to these last remarks, there was what state witnesses described as \"muttering\" and \"grumbling\" by the white onlookers.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe Sheriff, deeming, as he testified, Cox's appeal to the students to sit in at the lunch counters to be \"inflammatory,\" then took a power microphone and said, \"Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate. Up until now your demonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of the law, a disturbance of the peace, and it has got to be broken up immediately.\" The testimony as to what then happened is disputed. Some of the State's witnesses testified that Cox said, \"don't move\"; others stated that he made a \"gesture of defiance.\" It is clear from the record, however, that Cox and the demonstrators did not then and there break up the demonstration. Two of the Sheriff's deputies immediately started across the street and told the group, \"You have heard what the Sheriff said, now, do what he said.\" A state witness testified that they \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 544]\n\u00a0\n put their hands on the shoulders of some of the students \"as though to shove them away.\"\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter - within a time estimated variously at two to five minutes - one of the policemen exploded a tear gas shell at the crowd. This was followed by several other shells. The demonstrators quickly dispersed, running back towards the State Capitol and the downtown area; Cox tried to calm them as they ran and was himself one of the last to leave.\n\nNo Negroes participating in the demonstration were arrested on that day. The only person then arrested was a young white man, not a part of the demonstration, who was arrested \"because he was causing a disturbance.\" The next day appellant was arrested and charged with the four offenses above described.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n  THE BREACH OF THE PEACE CONVICTION.\n\n\n Appellant was convicted of violating a Louisiana \"disturbing the peace\" statute, which provides:\n\n \"Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby . . . crowds or congregates with others . . . in or upon . . . a public street or public highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building . . . and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on . . . when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person . . . shall be guilty of disturbing the peace.\" La. Rev. Stat. 14:103.1 (Cum. Supp. 1962).\n\n\n It is clear to us that on the facts of this case, which are strikingly similar to those present in Edwards v. South \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 545]\n\u00a0\n Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229\n, and Fields v. South Carolina, \n375 \nU.S. 44\n, Louisiana infringed appellant's rights of free speech and free assembly by convicting him under this statute. As in Edwards, we do not find it necessary to pass upon appellant's contention that there was a complete absence of evidence so that his conviction deprived him of liberty without due process of law. Cf. Thompson v. Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n. We hold that Louisiana may not constitutionally punish appellant under this statute for engaging in the type of conduct which this record reveals, and also that the statute as authoritatively interpreted by the Louisiana Supreme Court is unconstitutionally broad in scope.\n\nThe Louisiana courts have held that appellant's conduct constituted a breach of the peace under state law, and, as in Edwards, \"we may accept their decision as binding upon us to that extent,\" Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 235; but our independent examination of the record, which we are required to make,\n8\n shows no conduct which the State had a right to prohibit as a breach of the peace.\n\nAppellant led a group of young college students who wished \"to protest segregation\" and discrimination against Negroes and the arrest of 23 fellow students. They assembled peaceably at the State Capitol building \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 546]\n\u00a0\n and marched to the courthouse where they sang, prayed and listened to a speech. A reading of the record reveals agreement on the part of the State's witnesses that Cox had the demonstration \"very well controlled,\" and until the end of Cox's speech, the group was perfectly \"orderly.\" Sheriff Clemmons testified that the crowd's activities were not \"objectionable\" before that time. They became objectionable, according to the Sheriff himself, when Cox, concluding his speech, urged the students to go uptown and sit in at lunch counters. The Sheriff testified that the sole aspect of the program to which he objected was \"[t]he inflammatory manner in which he [Cox] addressed that crowd and told them to go on up town, go to four places on the protest list, sit down and if they don't feed you, sit there for one hour.\" Yet this part of Cox's speech obviously did not deprive the demonstration of its protected character under the Constitution as free speech and assembly. See Edwards v. South Carolina, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n; Garner v. Louisiana, \n368 \nU.S. 157, 185\n (concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN).\n\nThe State argues, however, that while the demonstrators started out to be orderly, the loud cheering and clapping by the students in response to the singing from the jail converted the peaceful assembly into a riotous one.\n9\n The record, however, does not support this assertion. It is true that the students, in response to the singing \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 547]\n\u00a0\n of their fellows who were in custody, cheered and applauded. However, the meeting was an outdoor meeting and a key state witness testified that while the singing was loud, it was not disorderly. There is, moreover, no indication that the mood of the students was ever hostile, aggressive, or unfriendly. Our conclusion that the entire meeting from the beginning until its dispersal by tear gas was orderly\n10\n and not riotous is confirmed by a film of the events taken by a television news photographer, which was offered in evidence as a state exhibit. We have viewed the film, and it reveals that the students, though they undoubtedly cheered and clapped, were well-behaved throughout. My Brother BLACK, concurring in this opinion and dissenting in No. 49, post, agrees \"that \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 548]\n\u00a0\n the record does not show boisterous or violent conduct or indecent language on the part of the . . .\" students. Post, at 583. The singing and cheering do not seem to us to differ significantly from the constitutionally protected activity of the demonstrators in Edwards,\n11\n who loudly sang \"while stamping their feet and clapping their hands.\" Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 233.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 549]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur conclusion that the record does not support the contention that the students' cheering, clapping and singing constituted a breach of the peace is confirmed by the fact that these were not relied on as a basis for conviction by the trial judge, who, rather, stated as his reason for convicting Cox of disturbing the peace that \"[i]t must be \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 550]\n\u00a0\n recognized to be inherently dangerous and a breach of the peace to bring 1,500 people, colored people, down in the predominantly white business district in the City of Baton Rouge and congregate across the street from the courthouse and sing songs as described to me by the defendant as the CORE national anthem carrying lines such as `black and white together' and to urge those 1,500 people to descend upon our lunch counters and sit there until they are served. That has to be an inherent breach of the peace, and our statute 14:103.1 has made it so.\"\n\nFinally, the State contends that the conviction should be sustained because of fear expressed by some of the state witnesses that \"violence was about to erupt\" because of the demonstration. It is virtually undisputed, however, that the students themselves were not violent and threatened no violence. The fear of violence seems to have been based upon the reaction of the group of white citizens looking on from across the street. One state witness testified that \"he felt the situation was getting out of hand\" as on the courthouse side of St. Louis Street \"were small knots or groups of white citizens who were muttering words, who seemed a little bit agitated.\" A police officer stated that the reaction of the white crowd was not violent, but \"was rumblings.\" Others felt the atmosphere became \"tense\" because of \"mutterings,\" \"grumbling,\" and \"jeering\" from the white group. There is no indication, however, that any member of the white group threatened violence. And this small crowd estimated at between 100 and 300 was separated from the students by \"seventy-five to eighty\" armed policemen, including \"every available shift of the City Police,\" the \"Sheriff's Office in full complement,\" and \"additional help from the State Police,\" along with a \"fire truck and the Fire Department.\" As Inspector Trigg testified, they could have handled the crowd. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 551]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis situation, like that in Edwards, is \"a far cry from the situation in Feiner v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 315\n.\" See Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 236. Nor is there any evidence here of \"fighting words.\" See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \n315 \nU.S. 568\n. Here again, as in Edwards, this evidence \"showed no more than that the opinions which . . . [the students] were peaceably expressing were sufficiently opposed to the views of the majority of the community to attract a crowd and necessitate police protection.\" Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 237. Conceding this was so, the \"compelling answer . . . is that constitutional rights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.\" Watson v. Memphis, \n373 \nU.S. 526, 535\n.\n\nThere is an additional reason why this conviction cannot be sustained. The statute at issue in this case, as authoritatively interpreted by the Louisiana Supreme Court, is unconstitutionally vague in its overly broad scope. The statutory crime consists of two elements: (1) congregating with others \"with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned,\" and (2) a refusal to move on after having been ordered to do so by a law enforcement officer. While the second part of this offense is narrow and specific, the first element is not. The Louisiana Supreme Court in this case defined the term \"breach of the peace\" as \"to agitate, to arouse from a state of repose, to molest, to interrupt, to hinder, to disquiet.\" 244 La., at 1105, 156 So.2d, at 455. In Edwards, defendants had been convicted of a common-law crime similarly defined by the South Carolina Supreme Court. Both definitions would allow persons to be punished merely for peacefully expressing unpopular views. Yet, a \"function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 552]\n\u00a0\n conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech . . . is . . . protected against censorship or punishment . . . . There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, courts, or dominant political or community groups.\" Terminiello v. Chicago, \n337 \nU.S. 1, 4\n-5. In Terminiello convictions were not allowed to stand because the trial judge charged that speech of the defendants could be punished as a breach of the peace \"`if it stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance, or if it molests the inhabitants in the enjoyment of peace and quiet by arousing alarm.'\" Id., at 3. The Louisiana statute, as interpreted by the Louisiana court, is at least as likely to allow conviction for innocent speech as was the charge of the trial judge in Terminiello. Therefore, as in Terminiello and Edwards the conviction under this statute must be reversed as the statute is unconstitutional in that it sweeps within its broad scope activities that are constitutionally protected free speech and assembly. Maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion is a basic tenet of our constitutional democracy. As Chief Justice Hughes stated in Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 369\n: \"A statute which upon its face, and as authoritatively construed, is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nFor all these reasons we hold that appellant's freedoms of speech and assembly, secured to him by the First Amendment, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, were denied by his conviction for disturbing the peace. The conviction on this charge cannot stand. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 553]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n  THE OBSTRUCTING PUBLIC PASSAGES CONVICTION.\n\n\n We now turn to the issue of the validity of appellant's conviction for violating the Louisiana statute, La. Rev. Stat. 14:100.1 (Cum. Supp. 1962), which provides:\n\n  \"Obstructing Public Passages\n\n\n \"No person shall wilfully obstruct the free, convenient and normal use of any public sidewalk, street, highway, bridge, alley, road, or other passageway, or the entrance, corridor or passage of any public building, structure, watercraft or ferry, by impeding, hindering, stifling, retarding or restraining traffic or passage thereon or therein.\n\n\n \"Providing however nothing herein contained shall apply to a bona fide legitimate labor organization or to any of its legal activities such as picketing, lawful assembly or concerted activity in the interest of its members for the purpose of accomplishing or securing more favorable wage standards, hours of employment and working conditions.\"\n\n\n Appellant was convicted under this statute, not for leading the march to the vicinity of the courthouse, which the Louisiana Supreme Court stated to have been \"orderly,\" 244 La., at 1096, 156 So.2d, at 451, but for leading the meeting on the sidewalk across the street from the courthouse. Id., at 1094, 1106-1107, 156 So.2d, at 451, 455. In upholding appellant's conviction under this statute, the Louisiana Supreme Court thus construed the statute so as to apply to public assemblies which do not have as their specific purpose the obstruction of traffic. There is no doubt from the record in this case that this far sidewalk was obstructed, and thus, as so construed, appellant violated the statute.\n\nAppellant, however, contends that as so construed and applied in this case, the statute is an unconstitutional \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 554]\n\u00a0\n infringement on freedom of speech and assembly. This contention on the facts here presented raises an issue with which this Court has dealt in many decisions, that is, the right of a State or municipality to regulate the use of city streets and other facilities to assure the safety and convenience of the people in their use and the concomitant right of the people of free speech and assembly. See Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n; Hague v. CIO, \n307 \nU.S. 496\n; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n; Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; Cox v. New Hampshire, \n312 \nU.S. 569\n; Largent v. Texas, \n318 \nU.S. 418\n; Saia v. New York, \n334 \nU.S. 558\n; Kovacs v. Cooper, \n336 \nU.S. 77\n; Niemotko v. Maryland, \n340 \nU.S. 268\n; Kunz v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 290\n; Poulos v. New Hampshire, \n345 \nU.S. 395\n.\n\nFrom these decisions certain clear principles emerge. The rights of free speech and assembly, while fundamental in our democratic society, still do not mean that everyone with opinions or beliefs to express may address a group at any public place and at any time. The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. The control of travel on the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to insure this necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, and not susceptible to abuses of discriminatory application, cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which, in other circumstances, would be entitled to protection. One would not be justified in ignoring the familiar red light because this was thought to be a means of social protest. Nor could one, contrary to traffic regulations, insist upon a street meeting in the middle of Times Square at the rush hour as a form of freedom of speech or assembly. Governmental authorities have \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 555]\n\u00a0\n the duty and responsibility to keep their streets open and available for movement. A group of demonstrators could not insist upon the right to cordon off a street, or entrance to a public or private building, and allow no one to pass who did not agree to listen to their exhortations. See Lovell v. Griffin, supra, at 451; Cox v. New Hampshire, supra, at 574; Schneider v. State, supra, at 160-161; Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, at 306-307; Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n; Poulos v. New Hampshire, supra, at 405-408; see also, Edwards v. South Carolina, supra, at 236.\n\nWe emphatically reject the notion urged by appellant that the First and Fourteenth Amendments afford the same kind of freedom to those who would communicate ideas by conduct such as patrolling, marching, and picketing on streets and highways, as these amendments afford to those who communicate ideas by pure speech. See the discussion and cases cited in No. 49, post, at 563. We reaffirm the statement of the Court in Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra, at 502, that \"it has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\"\n\nWe have no occasion in this case to consider the constitutionality of the uniform, consistent, and nondiscriminatory application of a statute forbidding all access to streets and other public facilities for parades and meetings.\n13\n Although the statute here involved on its face \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n precludes all street assemblies and parades,\n14\n it has not been so applied and enforced by the Baton Rouge authorities. City officials who testified for the State clearly indicated that certain meetings and parades are permitted in Baton Rouge, even though they have the effect of obstructing traffic, provided prior approval is obtained. This was confirmed in oral argument before this Court by counsel for the State. He stated that parades and meetings are permitted, based on \"arrangements . . . made with officials.\" The statute itself provides no standards for the determination of local officials as to which assemblies to permit or which to prohibit. Nor are there any administrative regulations on this subject which have been called to our attention.\n15\n From all \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 557]\n\u00a0\n the evidence before us it appears that the authorities in Baton Rouge permit or prohibit parades or street meetings in their completely uncontrolled discretion.\n\nThe situation is thus the same as if the statute itself expressly provided that there could only be peaceful parades or demonstrations in the unbridled discretion of the local officials. The pervasive restraint on freedom of discussion by the practice of the authorities under the statute is not any less effective than a statute expressly permitting such selective enforcement. A long line of cases in this Court makes it clear that a State or municipality cannot \"require all who wish to disseminate ideas to present them first to police authorities for their consideration and approval, with a discretion in the police to say some ideas may, while others may not, be . . . disseminate[d] . . . .\" Schneider v. State, supra, at 164. See Lovell v. Griffin, supra; Hague v. CIO, supra; Largent v. Texas, supra; Saia v. New York, supra; Niemotko v. Maryland, supra; Kunz v. New York, supra.\n\nThis Court has recognized that the lodging of such broad discretion in a public official allows him to determine which expressions of view will be permitted and which will not. This thus sanctions a device for the suppression of the communication of ideas and permits the official to act as a censor. See Saia v. New York, supra, at 562. Also inherent in such a system allowing parades or meetings only with the prior permission of an official is the obvious danger to the right of a person or group not to be denied equal protection of the laws. See Niemotko v. Maryland, supra, at 272, 284; cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n. It is clearly unconstitutional to enable a public official to determine which expressions of view will be permitted and which will not or to engage in invidious discrimination among persons or groups either by use of a statute providing a system of broad discretionary licensing power or, as in this case, the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 558]\n\u00a0\n equivalent of such a system by selective enforcement of an extremely broad prohibitory statute.\n\nIt is, of course, undisputed that appropriate, limited discretion, under properly drawn statutes or ordinances, concerning the time, place, duration, or manner of use of the streets for public assemblies may be vested in administrative officials, provided that such limited discretion is \"exercised with `uniformity of method of treatment upon the facts of each application, free from improper or inappropriate considerations and from unfair discrimination' . . . [and with] a `systematic, consistent and just order of treatment, with reference to the convenience of public use of the highways . . . .'\" Cox v. New Hampshire, supra, at 576. See Poulos v. New Hampshire, supra.\n\nBut here it is clear that the practice in Baton Rouge allowing unfettered discretion in local officials in the regulation of the use of the streets for peaceful parades and meetings is an unwarranted abridgment of appellant's freedom of speech and assembly secured to him by the First Amendment, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. It follows, therefore, that appellant's conviction for violating the statute as so applied and enforced must be reversed.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is reversed.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n [For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK, see post, p. 575.]\n\n[For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, see post, p. 585.]\n\n[For opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in part and dissenting in part, see post, p. 591.]\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Estimates of the crowd's size varied from 1,500 to 3,800. Two thousand seems to have been the consensus and was the figure accepted by the Louisiana Supreme Court, 244 La., at 1095, 156 So.2d ___, at 451.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There were varying versions in the record as to the time the demonstration would take. The State's version was that Cox asked for seven minutes. Cox's version was that he said his speech would take seven minutes but that the whole program would take between 17 and 25 minutes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The \"permission\" granted the students to demonstrate is discussed at greater length in No. 49, where its legal effect is considered.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A few days before, Cox had participated with some of the demonstrators in a \"direct non-violent clinic\" sponsored by CORE and held at St. Mark's Church.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sheriff Clemmons had no objection to this part of the speech. He testified on cross-examination as follows:\n\n\"Q. Did you have any objection to that part of his talk?\n\n\n\"A. None whatever. If he would have done what he said, there would have been no trouble at all. The whole thing would have been over and done with.\n\n\n\"Q. Did you have any objection to them being assembled on that side of the street while he was making that speech, sir?\n\n\n\"A. I had no objection to it.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Sheriff Clemmons objected strongly to these words. He testified on cross-examination as follows:\n\n\"Q. Now, what part of his speech became objectionable to him being assembled there?\n\n\n\"A. The inflammatory manner in which he addressed that crowd and told them to go on up town, go to four places on the protest list, sit down and if they don't feed you, sit there for one hour.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The exact sequence of these events is unclear from the record, being described differently not only by the State and the defense, but also by the state witnesses themselves. It seems reasonably certain, however, that the response to the singing from the jail, the end of Cox's speech, and the \"muttering\" and \"grumbling\" of the white onlookers all took place at approximately the same time.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Because a claim of constitutionally protected right is involved, it \"remains our duty in a case such as this to make an independent examination of the whole record.\" Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229, 235\n; Blackburn v. Alabama, \n361 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, n. 5; Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331, 335\n; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380, 385\n-386. In the area of First Amendment freedoms as well as areas involving other constitutionally protected rights, \"we cannot avoid our responsibilities by permitting ourselves to be `completely bound by state court determination of any issue essential to decision of a claim of federal right, else federal law could be frustrated by distorted fact finding.'\" Haynes v. Washington, \n373 \nU.S. 503, 515\n-516; Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156, 181\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The cheering and shouting were described differently by different witnesses, but the most extravagant descriptions were the following: \"a jumbled roar like people cheering at a football game,\" \"loud cheering and spontaneous clapping and screaming and a great hulla-baloo,\" \"a great outburst,\" a cheer of \"conquest . . . much wilder than a football game,\" \"a loud reaction, not disorderly, loud,\" \"a shout, a roar,\" and an emotional response \"in jubilation and exhortation.\" Appellant agreed that some of the group \"became emotional\" and \"tears flowed from young ladies' eyes.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] There is much testimony that the demonstrators were well controlled and basically orderly throughout. G. Dupre Litton, an attorney and witness for the State, testified, \"I would say that it was an orderly demonstration. It was too large a group, in my opinion, to congregate at that place at that particular time, which is nothing but my opinion . . . but generally . . . it was orderly.\" Robert Durham, a news photographer for WBRZ, a state witness, testified that although the demonstration was not \"quiet and peaceful,\" it was basically \"orderly.\" James Erwin, news director of WIBR, a witness for the State, testified as follows:\n\n\"Q. Was the demonstration generally orderly?\n\n\n\"A. Yes, Reverend Cox had it very well controlled.\"\n\n\n On the other hand, there is some evidence to the contrary: Erwin also stated:\n\n\"Q. Was it orderly up to the point of throwing the tear gas?\n\n\n\"A. No, there was one minor outburst after he called for the sitins, and then a minor reaction, and then a loud reaction, not disorderly, loud . . . . A loud reaction when the singing occurred upstairs.\"\n\n\n And James Dumigan, a police officer, thought that the demonstrators showed a certain disorder by \"hollering loud, clapping their hands.\" But this latter evidence is surely not sufficient, particularly in face of the film, to lead us to conclude that the cheering was so disorderly as to be beyond that held constitutionally protected in Edwards v. South Carolina, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Moreover, there are not significantly more demonstrators here than in Fields v. South Carolina, supra, which involved more than 1,000 students.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Witnesses who concluded that a breach of the peace was threatened or had occurred based their conclusions, not upon the shouting or cheering, but upon the fact that the group was demonstrating at all, upon Cox's suggestion that the group sit in, or upon the reaction of the white onlookers across the street. Rush Biossat, a state witness, testified that while appellant \"didn't say anything of a violent nature,\" there was \"emotional upset,\" \"a feeling of disturbance in the air,\" and \"agitation\"; he thought, however, that all this was caused by Cox's remarks about \"black and white together.\" James Erwin, a state witness, and news director of WIBR, testified that there was \"considerable stirring\" and a \"restiveness,\" but among the white group. He also stated that the reaction of the white group to Cox's speech \"was electrifying.\" \"You could hear grumbling from the small groups of white people, some total of two hundred fifty, perhaps . . . and there was a definite feeling of ill will that had sprung up.\" He was afraid that \"violence was about to erupt\" but also thought that Cox had his group under control and did not want violence. G. L. Johnston, a police officer and a witness for the State, felt that the disorderly part of the demonstration was Cox's suggestion that the group sit in. Vay Carpenter, and Mary O'Brien, legal secretaries and witnesses for the State, thought that the mood of the crowd changed at the time of Cox's speech and became \"tense.\" They thought this was because of the sit-in suggestion. Chief Kling of the Sheriff's office, testifying for the State, said that the situation became one \"that was explosive and one that had gotten to the point where it had to be handled or it would have gotten out of hand\"; however, he based his opinion upon \"the mere presence of these people in downtown Baton Rouge . . . in such great numbers.\" Police Captain Font also testified for the State that the situation was \"explosive\"; he based this opinion on \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 549]\n\u00a0\n \"how they came, such a large group like that, just coming out of nowhere, just coming, filling the streets, filling the sidewalks. We are prepared - we have traffic officers. We can handle traffic situations if we are advised that we are going to have a traffic situation, if the sidewalk is going to be blocked, if the street is going to be blocked, but we wasn't advised of it. They just came and blocked it.\" He added that he feared \"bloodshed,\" but based this fear upon \"when the Sheriff requested them to move, they didn't move; when they cheered in a conquest type of tone; their displaying of the signs; the deliberate agitation that twenty-five people had been arrested the day before, and then they turned right around and just agitated the next day in the same prescribed manner.\" He also felt that the students displayed their signs in a way which was \"agitating.\" Inspector Trigg testified for the State that \"from their actions, I figured they were going to try to storm the Courthouse and take over the jail and try to get the prisoners that they had come down here to protest.\" However, Trigg based his conclusions upon the students having marched down from the Capitol and paraded in front of the courthouse; he thought they were \"violent\" because \"they continued to march around this Courthouse, and they continued to march down here and do things that disrupts our way of living down here.\" Sheriff Clemmons testified that the assembly \"became objectionable\" at the time of Cox's speech. The Sheriff objected to \"the inflammatory manner in which he addressed that crowd and told them to go on up town, go to four places on the protest list, sit down and if they don't feed you, sit there for one hour. Prior to that, though, out from under these coats, some signs of - picketing signs. I don't know what's coming out of there next. It could be anything under a coat. It became inflammatory, and when he gestured, go on up town and take charge of these places . . . of business. That is what they were trying to do is take charge of this Courthouse.\"\n\nA close reading of the record seems to reveal next to no evidence that anyone thought that the shouting and cheering were what constituted the threatened breach of the peace.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] It has been argued that, in the exercise of its regulatory power over streets and other public facilities, a State or municipality could reserve the streets completely for traffic and other facilities for rest and relaxation of the citizenry. See Kovacs v. Cooper, supra, at 98 (opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson); Kunz v. New York, supra, at 298 (Mr. Justice Jackson, dissenting). The contrary, however, has been indicated, at least to the point that some open area must be preserved for outdoor assemblies. See Hague v. CIO, supra, at 515-516 \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n (opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts); Kunz v. New York, supra, at 293; Niemotko v. Maryland, supra, at 283 (Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring). See generally, Poulos v. New Hampshire, supra, at 403; Niemotko v. Maryland, supra, at 272-273.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] With the express exception, of course, of labor picketing. This exception points up the fact that the statute reaches beyond mere traffic regulation to restrictions on expression.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Although cited by neither party, research has disclosed the existence of a local ordinance of Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge City Code, Tit. 11, 210 (1957), which prohibits \"parade[s] . . . along any street except in accordance with a permit issued by the chief of police . . . .\" A similar ordinance was in existence in Fields v. South Carolina, supra. As in Fields, this ordinance is irrelevant to the conviction in this case as not only was appellant not charged with its violation but the existence of the ordinance was never referred to by the State in any of the courts involved in the case, including this one, and neither the Louisiana trial court nor the Supreme Court relied on the ordinance in sustaining appellant's convictions under the three statutes here involved. Moreover, since the ordinance apparently sets forth no standards for the determination of the Chief of Police as to which parades to permit or which to prohibit, obvious constitutional problems would arise if appellant had been convicted for parading in violation of it. See the discussion in text above; Lovell v. Griffin, supra, at 452-453; Hague v. CIO, supra, at 518; Saia v. New York, supra, at 559-560. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 536, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRIDER v. ZURICH INS. CO.(1965)\nNo. 116\nArgued: January 19, 1965Decided: March 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, an Alabama resident, was injured in that State while working for a Georgia corporation, against which he then secured a default judgment in an Alabama court under the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Act. Petitioner then brought this diversity action on the judgment against respondent, his employer's insurer, in the District Court, which granted a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Alabama court lacked jurisdiction to award damages under the Georgia Act providing for a remedy which could be afforded exclusively by the Georgia compensation board. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The State where an employee resides and is injured may adopt such choice of remedy as it desires, and Alabama was free to adopt and enforce the remedy provided by Georgia without any requirement imposed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause that the special Georgia procedure be followed. Pp. 41-43.\n\n 324 F.2d 499, reversed.\n\nMax C. Pope, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was J. Terry Huffstutler.\n\nFoster Etheredge argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, a resident of Alabama and employed there by Lawler Construction Co., Inc., a Georgia corporation. was injured. Both he and Lawler were under Georgia's Workmen's Compensation Act at the time. Petitioner sued in an Alabama court under the Georgia Act and obtained a judgment by default against Lawler. Respondent, the insurer of Lawler, was sued in the Federal District \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 40]\n\u00a0\n Court by petitioner on his Alabama judgment, federal jurisdiction being based on diversity of citizenship. The District Court granted respondent's motion to dismiss (224 F. Supp. 87) and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 324 F.2d 499. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 942\n.\n\nThe District Court and the Court of Appeals stood on Green v. J. A. Jones Construct. Co., 161 F.2d 359, which held that a Mississippi state court had no jurisdiction to award damages under the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Act and that the Federal District Court for Mississippi was under the same disability, Georgia decisions settling the point that the remedy provided by the Georgia Act is \"an exclusive one which can be afforded only\" by the Georgia Compensation Board. Ibid.\n\nWe assume that the lower courts were correct in stating what the Georgia law is. But the mere fact that petitioner, if he had sued in Georgia, would have had to follow that course does not necessarily mean that the Alabama state court was in error in taking jurisdiction of the cause.\n\nThe Alabama state court dealt with an injury occurring to an Alabama resident while working in Alabama. Under Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145\n, a State could fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents wherever the accident happened and the Full Faith and Credit Clause (Art. IV, 1) required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy. That case would have been on all fours with the present one had petitioner been a resident of Georgia, rather than Alabama. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532\n, and Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493\n, mark a break with the Clapper philosophy. Alaska Packers allowed the State of residence of the injured employee to supply a remedy different from the Compensation Act of the place of the injury, even though the employee had agreed to be \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n bound by the latter remedy. Pacific Insurance held that a person injured while working in California could recover under California's Compensation Act even though the injured person was a Massachusetts resident, regularly employed there by a Massachusetts corporation and even though the Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy. In Carroll v. Lanza, \n349 \nU.S. 408\n, Arkansas, the place where the injury occurred, was allowed to grant common-law damages even though Missouri, the home State, had a Compensation Act that purported to be exclusive. As we stated in that case:\n\n \"Missouri can make her Compensation Act exclusive, if she chooses, and enforce it as she pleases within her borders. Once that policy is extended into other States, different considerations come into play. Arkansas can adopt Missouri's policy if she likes. Or, as the Pacific Employers Insurance Co. case teaches, she may supplement it or displace it with another, insofar as remedies for acts occurring within her boundaries are concerned. Were it otherwise, the State where the injury occurred would be powerless to provide any remedies or safeguards to nonresident employees working within its borders. We do not think the Full Faith and Credit Clause demands that subserviency from the State of the injury.\" Id., pp. 413-414.\n\n\n The State where the employee lives and where he was injured has a large and considerable interest in the event. As we said in Carroll v. Lanza, supra, p. 413, \"The State where the tort occurs certainly has a concern in the problems following in the wake of the injury. The problems of medical care and of possible dependents are among these . . . .\" The State where the employee lives has perhaps even a larger concern, for it is there that he is expected to return; and it is on his community that the impact of the injury is apt to be most keenly felt. Certainly \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n when the injury occurs in the home State of the employee, the interest of that State is at least commensurate with the interest of the State in which an injury occurs involving a nonresident, as in Carroll v. Lanza. If Arkansas had a sufficient interest there to override Missouri's exclusive remedy, Alabama may override Georgia's here.\n\nThe Alabama policy in that regard is reflected in the judgment rendered by the Alabama court on which this federal suit was instituted. That Alabama judgment adopted and enforced the remedy provided by Georgia - a procedure we indicated in Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Commission, supra, p. 500, a State might follow. Here as in Alaska Packers Assn. v. Commission, supra, p. 544, \". . . the compensation acts of either jurisdiction may, consistently with due process, be applied in either . . . .\" We were consistent with that view in Carroll v. Lanza, supra, when we said, in what we have already quoted, that the State of the forum may \"supplement\" or \"displace\" the remedy of the other State, consistently with constitutional requirements. 349 U.S., p. 414.\n\nIt is earnestly argued by the dissent that the Green decision, supra, which the Court of Appeals followed in the present case, \"did not rest on constitutional grounds,\" post, p. 46. Rather it is said that Green expresses merely a state conflicts rule.\n*\n We do not so read Green. There the court said that its decision was controlled by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n the principle that \"where the provision for the liability claimed is coupled with a provision for a special remedy to be afforded not by a court but by a commission, that remedy and that alone must be employed . . . .\" 161 F.2d 359. This principle is almost a verbatim restatement of the rule adverted to in Tennessee Coal Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354, 359\n: \"`where the provision for the liability is coupled with a provision for a special remedy, that remedy, and that alone, must be employed.'\" And our older cases assumed that this broad rule was compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. See, e. g., ibid., and cases cited; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55\n; and also the discussion in Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 309 F.2d 553. But, as we have demonstrated, that rule has been eroded by the line of cases beginning with Alaska Packers and Pacific Insurance. Our holding frees the Court of Appeals on remand to reconsider its holding free from any supposed constitutional compulsion.\n\n    Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] We stated in Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., \n345 \nU.S. 514, 516\n: \"The states are free to adopt such rules of conflict of laws as they choose, Kryger v. Wilson, \n242 \nU.S. 171\n (1916), subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause and other constitutional restrictions. The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel a state to adopt any particular set of rules of conflict of laws; it merely sets certain minimum requirements which each state must observe when asked to apply the law of a sister state.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nThe resolution of the issue before the Court in this case necessitates setting out the history of this litigation in more detail than does the Court. Petitioner originally brought his action against the employer in an Alabama court in a three-count complaint, the first count relying on Alabama's Workmen's Compensation Act and the other two on Alabama common law. He then voluntarily dismissed these counts and reinstituted the action in the Alabama court with sole and express reliance on the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Act. A default judgment was then entered in petitioner's favor on the basis of this new complaint. No appeal was taken from this default judgment. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner then filed a complaint in an Alabama court against respondent, the employer's insurance company, to enforce the previously obtained default judgment. Respondent asserted in defense that, since the Georgia Act upon which the action was based provides for primary jurisdiction in an administrative board and precludes original court jurisdiction, the Alabama court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. The default judgment, therefore, respondent contended, was void and could be collaterally attacked in the enforcement proceeding. Petitioner's demurrer to this defense was overruled by the Alabama court. Following this, petitioner voluntarily dismissed the action in the Alabama court and the next day filed the diversity suit here before us, identical to the previous Alabama action. Respondent again asserted the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. Based on this defense, and after the submission of briefs and oral argument, Judge Grooms dismissed the complaint. In holding that there had not been subject matter jurisdiction to enter the default judgment, Judge Grooms relied on Green v. J. A. Jones Construct. Co., 161 F.2d 359, a decision of the Fifth Circuit. 224 F. Supp. 87, 88. He then went on to hold, relying on Alabama cases, that since there had been no subject matter jurisdiction in the original action, the default judgment was, under Alabama law, subject to collateral attack. The Court of Appeals affirmed per curiam on the basis of its prior decision in Green v. J. A. Jones Construct. Co., supra. 324 F.2d 499.\n\nThis case does not present the issue of whether Alabama could have applied its own compensation act or its own common law. Respondent concedes that, on the facts of this case,\n1\n it could have applied either and our \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n decisions plainly so hold. See Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 493\n; Carroll v. Lanza, \n349 \nU.S. 408\n. But, as I have already noted, petitioner, who originally sued under both Alabama's Workmen's Compensation Act and common law, dismissed those counts and based his action solely on the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Act. The federal issue raised by respondent is whether, consistently with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a State may enforce in its courts the liability claims created by another State in violation of that other State's fixed policy to have those claims enforced only by an administrative board. There is no decision of this Court which settles this federal issue and, in my view, the question is not free from difficulty. See Tennessee Coal Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354, 359\n, and cases there cited; but cf. Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 309 F.2d 553 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Kilberg v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 9 N. Y. 2d 34, 172 N. E. 2d 526.\n\nOn the record here presented it seems clear to me that the Court should not reach this constitutional question. In the case before us, if Alabama's own law independently forbids the piecemeal borrowing of Georgia statutes and denies to the Alabama courts jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's suit on the Georgia statute, the question of whether the Federal Constitution forbids such piecemeal borrowing need not be reached. The Court recognizes, ante, at 42-43, that this issue is in the case, but bypasses this threshold state law issue and reaches the ultimate federal constitutional problem. In so doing, the Court disregards the long-settled rule that this Court will not pass upon federal constitutional questions if there are state law grounds presented upon which the case may be disposed of. See Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175\n; Ashwander v. Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 347\n (Brandeis, J., concurring), and cases there cited. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe sole basis for the Court's inversion of this longsettled rule of reaching state law issues before constitutional ones, is that it reads the decisions below as based upon \"supposed constitutional compulsion,\" ante, at 43, and not upon independent state law. I believe that the lower courts did rest their decisions upon independent state law and that they determined that the default judgment was void under Alabama law.\n\nThe opinion of Judge Grooms, an experienced Alabama lawyer, makes it clear that he relied upon Alabama law in deciding that the original default judgment could be collaterally attacked.\n2\n The Court apparently does not dispute this. It, however, reads the opinions below as relying upon federal and not upon independent state law for the determination that the Alabama court was without subject matter jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies upon the fact that both Judge Grooms and the Court of Appeals cited as controlling the Fifth Circuit's prior decision in Green v. J. A. Jones Construct. Co., supra. Ante, at 40. The Court then reads Green as resting upon full faith and credit compulsion. A careful reading of Green, however, discloses that it did not rest on constitutional grounds.\n\nThe Court of Appeals in Green had affirmed the dismissal by the United States District Court in Mississippi of a diversity action based upon the same Georgia statute \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 47]\n\u00a0\n which is involved in this case. The Green court stated its conclusion that \"it is quite clear that the case is ruled by the principle that where the provision for the liability claimed is coupled with a provision for a special remedy to be afforded not by a court but by a commission, that remedy and that alone must be employed and resort to court action may not be had for relief.\" Id., at 359. As authority for this \"principle\" the court cited the Restatement of the Law, Conflict of Laws, 618, Comment a, an Arkansas and a Missouri case, both resting on state law, and two federal court diversity cases, clearly applying state law.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the language of this general principle stated by the Green court is similar to that of Tennessee Coal Co. v. George, supra, at 359, quoted in the Court's opinion, ante, at 43, there is no indication whatsoever that this general state law principle was conceived to be based on federal compulsion emanating from the dictum in the George case. Nowhere in the Green opinion is there any mention of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the George case, or, indeed, any federal law. Moreover, the authorities cited by the Green court for this general principle similarly do not rest on any concept of federal compulsion. The Restatement's position is not conceived to be based on full faith and credit grounds.\n4\n Neither of the federal court cases cited has any reference at all to any federal law, including the George case. The same is true of the Missouri case cited, and the Arkansas case cited only \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 48]\n\u00a0\n refers to the George case for a different point in the George case. Finally, the text writers are in accord with these authorities in not basing the general state law principle on the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe Green case is not a case like those in which the opinion as a whole \"leaves the impression that the court probably felt constrained to rule as it did because of [decisions of this Court],\" Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551, 554\n-555, or \"because it felt under compulsion of federal law as enunciated by this Court so to hold,\" Missouri v. Mayfield, \n340 \nU.S. 1, 5\n. See Jankovich v. Indiana Toll Road Comm'n, \n379 \nU.S. 487, 492\n.\n\nThus the Green court clearly seems to have decided the case not on full faith and credit principles, but on the assumption that Mississippi law was in accord with the general independent state law rule.\n6\n When Judge Grooms and the Court of Appeals in the instant case, referred to Green, they were not therefore, referring to it as stating constitutional compulsion, but as stating the general state law rule to which both Mississippi and Alabama adhere. Again, as in Green there is nothing in either opinion below that might be taken as even a remote reference to the Full Faith and Credit Clause or any other federal rule or authority. I would not presume that the lower federal courts, particularly in a diversity case, would, in light of the settled decisions of this Court, decide a case by determining constitutional issues without first deciding threshold issues of state law. See Alma Motor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 49]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Timken Co., \n329 \nU.S. 129, 136\n-137. It seems clear to me, therefore, that the dismissal of petitioner's action was based on independent state law and not on federal grounds.\n\nEven if I am wrong on this point, however, and the Court is correct in assuming that the lower courts here did not rule on the question of independent state law, this would not justify the Court's ignoring the fact that the decision below is clearly supported by independent state law and, as a consequence, the constitutional issue should not be reached and decided. Cf. Neese v. Southern R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 77\n.\n\nIn Singleton v. Hope Engineering Co., 223 Ala. 538, 540, 137 So. 441, 442-443, the Alabama Supreme Court held that the Alabama courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the identical Georgia Workmen's Compensation Act here in issue, on the grounds that the enforcement of the Georgia Act is vested exclusively in the Georgia Workmen's Compensation Commission. In reaching this conclusion of state law the Alabama Supreme Court did not cite the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Tennessee Coal Co. v. George, supra, or indeed any federal authority whatsoever. While Singleton arose on direct appeal, this fact is not significant. In the instant case, Judge Grooms expressly held that where the court that entered the default judgment lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the controversy, Alabama law permits collateral attack on the validity of the default judgment.\n7\n As noted above, Singleton is in accord with the general state rule on this point and there is no claim that its vitality as a precedent has been impaired in any \n\n[380 \nU.S. 39, 50]\n\u00a0\n way.\n8\n Finally, while it is true that the Alabama enforcement action was dismissed without prejudice, the Alabama court in that case, in overruling the demurrer to this asserted defense, necessarily held that under Alabama law the default judgment was subject to collateral attack as it was entered by a court that lacked subject matter jurisdiction of the controversy. For these reasons I believe the decision below is clearly supported by independent Alabama law.\n\nCertiorari was granted in this case on the assumption that it necessitated deciding the constitutional issue involving the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Since, in my view, it is unnecessary and improper to reach that issue in this case, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.\n\nBut even if my analysis of the decisions below is erroneous and the Alabama law is not as clear as I conceive it to be, I would still not agree that it is appropriate to determine the ultimate constitutional issue. There is no doubt, as even the Court recognizes, that there exists here at least a lurking question of independent state law. Under such circumstances, the least that should be done is to vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the District Court for clarification of its opinion as to the status of Alabama law. Cf. Alma Motor Co. v. Timken Co., supra.\n\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As the Court points out, ante, at 39, 40, petitioner was an Alabama resident, and was injured while working in Alabama.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Judge Grooms stated, 224 F.

The crucial fact question in the case concerned the forklift truck. There was testimony that the petitioner had mounted the truck and backed it into the shaft. There was also evidence, however, which, if believed by the jury, would support a finding that the operator assigned to use the truck negligently left it unattended, and that it rolled toward the petitioner, either because it was not secured or because it was set in motion by an unauthorized third person, and struck petitioner in the back, propelling him into the shaft.

UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 486\nArgued: Decided: May 3, 1965\n\n\n\n\n A partnership to which petitioners belong, in 1952 bought short-term noninterest-bearing notes at discounts. The purchases were assertedly made in reliance on the published acquiescence of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Caulkins v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 656, aff'd 144 F.2d 482, where the Tax Court had allowed capital gains treatment of the full amount a taxpayer had received on an \"Accumulative Installment Certificate.\" After holding the notes six months they disposed of some at a gain before the end of the tax year and the balance in the next tax year. The partnership reported the gain as a long-term capital gain and, although on an accrual basis, did not accrue any income for the notes unsold that year. Petitioners' individual returns reflected the same treatment for their distributive shares of the partnership income. The Commissioner subsequently withdrew his acquiescence in Caulkins except with respect to debt securities that were (a) of the specific type involved in Caulkins, and (b) issued by the particular issuer involved in that case. The Commissioner determined that petitioners' gain was taxable as ordinary income and that a portion of the original issue discount on the unsold notes was reportable as earned in the tax year. Petitioners paid the deficiencies and sued for refund. Respondent prevailed in the District Court and the Court of Appeals. Held:\n\n 1. Original issue discount is not entitled to capital gains treatment under the 1939 Internal Revenue Code. United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., ante, p. 54, followed. P. 70.\n\n\n 2. The Commissioner's acquiescence in an erroneous decision of the Tax Court cannot by itself bar collection of a tax otherwise lawfully due; the Commissioner has discretion under 7805 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 retroactively to withdraw an acquiescence, and he may do so even where a taxpayer may have detrimentally relied on the Commissioner's mistake. Pp. 70-75.\n\n\n 3. The Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in this case by giving retroactive effect to the withdrawal of his acquiescence.

P. 76.\n\n\n  (b) Since the Commissioner's acquiescence in Caulkins should not have been read as constituting acceptance of the general proposition that earned original issue discount was entitled to capital gains treatment, the revocation of his acquiescence was not a repudiation of his earlier acceptance of a decision that prescribed capital gains treatment for the original issue discount here involved; consequently, his exception of specific certificates of the type involved in Caulkins from the retroactive application of his nonacquiescence could not constitute an abuse of discretion of which petitioners may complain.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the issue decided today in United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., No. 628, ante, p. 54. Petitioners are members of a partnership which, during the tax year 1952, bought 33 short-term noninterest-bearing notes from issuers at discounts between 2 3\/8% and 3 3\/4% of face value. The notes had maturities ranging from 190 to 272 days. Their total face value was $43,050,000, and the total issue price was $42,222,357. The partnership sold 20 of the 33 notes before the end of the tax year but after having held them for more than \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 70]\n\u00a0\n six months, realizing a gain of $494,528. The remaining 13 notes were disposed of in the next tax year. In its 1952 return the partnership reported the $494,528 gain as a long-term capital gain, and, although on the accrual basis, did not accrue any income on account of the 13 unsold notes. Petitioners' individual income tax returns reflected the same treatment for their respective distributive shares of the partnership income derived from the sale of the notes.\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the gain realized was taxable as ordinary income, and also that a portion of the original issue discount on the 13 unsold notes was earned and reportable as ordinary income for 1952.\n1\n Petitioners paid the resulting deficiencies, and in this suit for refund the United States prevailed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, 224 F. Supp. 358, and in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 333 F.2d 1016. We brought the case here on certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 943\n, to resolve a conflict with United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., supra. We affirm.\n\nOur holding today in Midland-Ross that original issue discount is not entitled to capital gains treatment under the 1939 Internal Revenue Code requires that we affirm the result below unless an affirmance is precluded by an argument made here and not in Midland-Ross. The petitioners contend that in purchasing the notes they relied upon the Commissioner's published acquiescence in the Tax Court's decision in Caulkins v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 71]\n\u00a0\n 656, aff'd 144 F.2d 482, not withdrawn until the transaction was closed,\n2\n which acquiescence would require treating the gain realized as gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset. Although petitioners concede that under 7805 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 the Commissioner has discretion to apply the withdrawal of the acquiescence retroactively, cf. Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, \n353 \nU.S. 180\n, they contend that he abused his discretion in this case.\n\nSection 7805 (b) provides:\n\n \"Retroactivity of Regulations or Rulings. - The Secretary  [of the Treasury] or his delegate may prescribe  the extent, if any, to which any ruling or regulation,  relating to the internal revenue laws, shall be applied  without retroactive effect.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n In Caulkins the Tax Court allowed capital gains treatment of the full amount received by the taxpayer upon the retirement of an \"Accumulative Installment Certificate,\" a debt security under which the lender made 10 \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 72]\n\u00a0\n annual remittances to the borrower in the amount of $1,500 each in return for a payment of $20,000 in the tenth year. See United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., supra, at 63. This result gave capital gains treatment to an amount corresponding to but not in the form of original issue discount. The basis for this result was an interpretation of 117 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1938. c. 289, 52 Stat. 447, which was re-enacted as 117 (f) of the 1939 Code, and which provided that \"amounts received by the holder upon the retirement of bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates or other evidences of indebtedness . . . with interest coupons or in registered form, shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor.\" The Commissioner's 1955 withdrawal of his acquiescence in the Tax Court's decision in Caulkins was made retroactive as a general matter, but an exception was made for \"amounts received upon redemption of Accumulative Installment Certificates issued by Investors Syndicate which were purchased during the period beginning December 25, 1944, the date acquiescence in the Caulkins case was announced and March 14, 1955, the date this Revenue Ruling is published . . . .\"\n4\n The exception thus covered only the debt securities of the specific type involved in Caulkins, and issued by the particular issuer there involved.\n\nIn Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, supra, at 183-184, we held that the Commissioner is empowered retroactively to correct mistakes of law in the application of the tax laws to particular transactions.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 73]\n\u00a0\n He may do so even where a taxpayer may have relied to his detriment on the Commissioner's mistake. See Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, \n297 \nU.S. 129\n. This principle is no more than a reflection of the fact that Congress, not the Commissioner, prescribes the tax laws. The Commissioner's rulings have only such force as Congress chooses to give them, and Congress has not given them the force of law. Consequently it would appear that the Commissioner's acquiescence in an erroneous decision, published as a ruling, cannot in and of itself bar the United States from collecting a tax otherwise lawfully due.\n\nBut petitioners point to prefatory statements in the Internal Revenue Bulletins for 1952 and other years stating that Tax Court decisions acquiesced in \"should be relied upon by officers and employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue as precedents in the disposition of other cases.\" See, e. g., 1952-1 Cum. Bull. IV. These are merely guidelines for Bureau personnel, however, and hardly help the petitioners here. The title pages of the same Revenue Bulletins give taxpayers explicit warning that rulings\n\n\". . . are for the information of taxpayers and their counsel as showing the trend of official opinion in . . . the Bureau of Internal Revenue; the rulings other than Treasury Decisions have none of the force or effect of Treasury Decisions and do not commit the Department to any interpretation of the law which has not been formally approved and promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury.\"\n6\n (Emphasis added.) \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 74]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This admonition, together with the language of 7805 (b)'s predecessor, 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code, gave ample notice that the Commissioner's acquiescence in Caulkins was not immune from subsequent retroactive correction to eliminate a mistake of law.\n\nIndeed, long before the tax year here in question this Court had made it clear that \"The power of an administrative officer or board to administer a federal statute and to prescribe rules and regulations to that end is not the power to make law . . . but the power to adopt regulations to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute. A regulation which does not do this, but operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity.\" Manhattan General Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, supra, at 134.\n7\n There we held that the Commissioner could make retroactive a new regulation increasing tax liability beyond that provided for by the prior regulation where the superseding regulation corrected an erroneous interpretation of the statute.\n\n\"The statute defines the rights of the taxpayer and fixes a standard by which such rights are to be measured. The regulation constitutes only a step in the administrative process. It does not, and could not, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 75]\n\u00a0\n alter the statute. It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determination construing and applying a statute to a case in hand.\" Id., at 135.\n\n\n This reasoning applies with even greater force to the Commissioner's rulings and acquiescences.\n8\n Therefore the acquiescence in Caulkins, even assuming for the moment that it embodied the Commissioner's acceptance of the treatment petitioners urge upon us here, does not preclude the Commissioner from collecting the tax lawfully due under the statute.\n\nWe cannot agree with petitioners that Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, supra, supports a finding that the Commissioner abused his discretion in giving retroactive effect to the withdrawal of the acquiescence. In that case the Commissioner had issued general pronouncements according exempt status to all automobile clubs similarly situated, following letter rulings to that effect in favor of the taxpayer. The Commissioner then corrected his erroneous view and, in 1945, specifically revoked the taxpayer's exemption for 1943 and subsequent years. We rejected the taxpayer's claim that the Commissioner had abused the discretion given him by 7805 (b)'s predecessor. The Commissioner's action had been forecast in a General Counsel Memorandum in 1943, and the corrected ruling had been applied to all automobile clubs for tax years back to 1943. \n353 \nU.S., at 185\n-186.\n\nPetitioners make two arguments based on Automobile Club of Michigan. First, they contend that the Commissioner's decision to apply his change of position retroactively to them is an abuse of discretion because, unlike \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 76]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer in Automobile Club, they had no notice in the relevant tax year that the Commissioner was about to correct his mistake of law, and thus had purchased the discounted notes in express reliance upon the Commissioner's published acquiescence in Caulkins. Second, they argue that the Commissioner abused his discretion because the retroactive withdrawal of his acquiescence in Caulkins excepted certificates of the type involved in Caulkins if issued by the issuer there involved and purchased while the acquiescence was in effect; this is said to be an unreasonable and arbitrary classification since, petitioners assert, there is no significant difference between the excepted certificates and the notes that they had purchased.\n\nAlthough we mentioned certain facts in support of our conclusion in Automobile Club that there had not been an abuse of discretion in that case, it does not follow that the absence of one or more of these facts in another case wherein a ruling or regulation is applied retroactively establishes an abuse of discretion. Automobile Club merely examined all the circumstances of the particular case to determine whether the Commissioner had there abused his discretion. \n353 \nU.S., at 185\n. In the present case it cannot be said that the Commissioner abused his discretion in either of the respects urged by petitioners. The absence of notice does not prove an abuse, since, for the reasons we have stated, the petitioners were not justified in relying on the acquiescence as precluding correction of the underlying mistake of law and the retroactive application of the correct law to their case. Since no reliance was warranted, no notice was required.\n\nNor is there merit in the argument that the Commissioner abused his discretion in distinguishing Investors Syndicate Accumulative Installment Certificates from other debt securities, for we do not think the Commissioner's acquiescence in Caulkins was to be interpreted as his acceptance of the proposition that earned original \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 77]\n\u00a0\n issue discount was entitled to capital gains treatment.\n9\n That interpretation might be properly put upon his acquiescence only if, first, the Tax Court in Caulkins squarely decided that any discount element in the amount realized by the taxpayer on the retirement of the certificate was not to be taxed as ordinary income but as capital gain, and, second, the decision of the Tax Court should be read as holding that the tax treatment of gain attributable to discount is the same on sales and retirements. But Caulkins embodies neither of these holdings. Therefore, when the Commissioner revoked his acquiescence in 1955 he was not repudiating his earlier acceptance of a decision that prescribed capital gains treatment for the earned original issue discount here involved. Consequently, his decision to except Accumulative Installment Certificates from the retroactive application of his nonacquiescence in Caulkins could not constitute an abuse of discretion of which the petitioners may complain.\n\nAs to item first: that the Tax Court in Caulkins did not squarely decide that the discount element in the amount realized by the taxpayer on the retirement of a debt security is to be taxed as a capital gain is apparent from its opinion. The Tax Court seemed to regard the only significant issue before it as whether the taxpayer's certificate of indebtedness was a \"registered\" certificate within \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 78]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of 117 (f). There was no explicit consideration of whether any discount element in the amount realized by the taxpayer on the certificate was to be taxed as ordinary income or as capital gain. It is at best highly questionable, therefore, that by acquiescing in this decision the Commissioner conceded that 117 (f) extended capital gains treatment to the discount element in the certificate of indebtedness.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nAs to item second: the petitioners were not warranted in reading Caulkins as holding that the gain realized on a sale that is attributable to original issue discount is to be given the same tax treatment as gain so attributable realized on a retirement. The opinion deals only with, and rests squarely upon, 117 (f), which is concerned with retirements. It is true that, in the case of securities in registered form or with coupons attached, that section was added by the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 714-715, to eliminate a difference in treatment between sales and retirements. See e. g., Fairbanks v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 436\n; Watson v. Commissioner, 27 B. T. A. 463. But the opinion in Caulkins appears erroneously to carry forward a distinction and to give more favorable treatment to retirements. See United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., supra, at 63-66. Thus petitioners should not have read Caulkins as they did. Indeed the Tax Court has since distinguished Caulkins on the ground that it rested on the 117 (f) language of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 79]\n\u00a0\n retirement and consequently was inapplicable to a sale. See Paine v. Commissioner, 23 T. C. 391, 401, rev'd on other grounds, 236 F.2d 398 (C. A. 8th Cir.); United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., supra, at 65.\n\nFurthermore, even on the assumption that Caulkins may be read as petitioners contend, petitioners had the burden of demonstrating that Accumulative Installment Certificates could not rationally be distinguished from other discounted securities. Cf. American State Bank v. United States, 279 F.2d 585, 589-590 (C. A. 7th Cir.); Schwartz v. Commissioner, 40 T. C. 191, 193. But the record is devoid of any evidence of effort by petitioners to discharge this burden by showing the absence of any significant difference between the holders of Accumulative Installment Certificates and themselves. Indeed, the Commissioner might well have believed that however mistaken the view that his acquiescence in Caulkins was tantamount to an acceptance of capital gains treatment for original issue discount, the assumption that such treatment would be given the discount element of their debt securities was more understandable in the case of holders of Accumulative Installment Certificates - the same obligations as were involved in Caulkins - than in the case of other taxpayers. So thinking, the Commissioner might further have concluded that equitable considerations pointed to making an exception to the retroactive application of the nonacquiescence for the holders of these Certificates. It is not for us to pass upon the wisdom of any such distinction. It suffices that on this record we cannot say that the distinction was so devoid of rational basis that we must now overturn the Commissioner's judgment.\n\nInsofar as petitioners' arguments question the policy of empowering the Commissioner to correct mistakes of law retroactively when a taxpayer acts to his detriment in reliance upon the Commissioner's acquiescence in an \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 80]\n\u00a0\n erroneous Tax Court decision,\n11\n their arguments are more appropriately addressed to Congress. Congress has seen fit to allow the Commissioner to correct mistakes of law, and in 7805 (b) has given him a large measure of discretion in determining when to apply his corrections retroactively. In the circumstances of this case we cannot say that this discretion was abused.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petitioners concede the correctness of this treatment of the earned discount on the 13 unsold notes if original issue discount is reportable as ordinary income. Again, as in Midland-Ross, we do not reach or intimate any view upon the question whether an accrual-basis taxpayer is required to report discount earned before the final disposition of an obligation. See United States v. Midland-Ross. ante, p. 54, at 58, note 4.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commissioner initially published a notification of nonacquiescence. See Rev. Rul. 11581, 1943 Cum. Bull. 1, 28. He published his acquiescence after the Court of Appeals affirmed the Tax Court. See Rev. Rul. 11907, 1944 Cum. Bull. 1, 5. The withdrawal of his acquiescence and the reinstatement of his initial nonacquiescence came in 1955, in 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 7, and Rev. Rul. 55-136, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 213.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code, 53 Stat. 467, was similarly worded except that the 1954 Act substituted \"The Secretary or his delegate\" for \"The Secretary, or the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary . . . .\"\n\nWhether the discount element of the gain from the notes here involved is a capital or an income item is governed by the relevant provisions of the 1939 Code, but the statute governing the retroactive application of the withdrawal of the acquiescence in 1955 is 7805 (b) of the 1954 Code, and not 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code. This makes no practical difference since the two provisions are identical apart from the variance mentioned above.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The withdrawal was published March 14, 1955. However, the exception was later limited to certificates acquired before December 31, 1954, Rev. Rul. 56-299, 1956-1 Cum. Bull. 603, apparently because 1232 of the 1954 Code applies to obligations issued after that date.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See also Helvering v. Reynolds, \n313 \nU.S. 428\n; Manhattan General Equipment Co. v.

Caution should be exercised in extending the application of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 68, 74]\n\u00a0\n decision to a similar case unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same . . . . \" E. g., 1964-1 Cum. Bull. 3.\n\n\n And the introduction to Revenue Rulings now expressly warns that \"Except where otherwise indicated, published rulings and procedures apply retroactively.\" Id., at 1. See also Rev. Proc. 62-28, 1962-2 Cum. Bull. 496, which states at 504:\n\n\"A ruling . . . may be revoked or modified at any time in the wise administration of the taxing statutes. . . . If a ruling is revoked or modified, the revocation or modification applies to all open years under the statutes, unless the Commissioner exercises the discretionary powers given to him under section 7805 (b) of the Code to limit the retroactive effect of the ruling.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See also Miller v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 435, 439\n-440; Lynch v. Tilden Produce Co., \n265 \nU.S. 315, 320\n-322.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Commissioner's acquiescence in Caulkins and his withdrawal and reinstatement of nonacquiescence were stated in Revenue Rulings. Present practice appears to be to publish acquiescence and nonacquiescences without incorporating them in rulings. See, e. g., 1964-1 Cum. Bull. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Petitioners invoke the principle that \"The Commissioner cannot tax one and not tax another without some rational basis for the difference. And so, assuming the correctness of the principle of `equality,' it can be an independent ground of decision that the Commissioner has been inconsistent, without much concern for whether we should hold as an original matter that the position the Commissioner now seeks to sustain is wrong.\" United States v.

Supp. 404; Connecticut Railway & Lighting Co. v. United States, 142 F. Supp. 907.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The opinion of the Court of Appeals stated that 117 (f) required that all gain realized upon retirement of an obligation to which the section applied be given capital gains treatment: that court's primary concern, however, was also with the question whether the section applied to the Caulkins certificates. Technically, the Commissioner's acquiescence in Caulkins was in the Tax Court decision and not in the decision of the Court of Appeals. As a general matter, the Commissioner still follows the practice of noting his acquiescence or nonacquiescence only in Tax Court decisions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf.

PFISTER(1965)\nNo. 52\nArgued: January 25, 1965Decided: April 26, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appellants, a civil rights organization and its executive director, brought suit in Federal District Court, in which other individuals later joined, for injunctive and declaratory relief to restrain appellees from prosecuting or threatening to prosecute them under Louisiana's Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and Communist Propaganda Control Law, which they alleged violated their rights of free expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Appellants contended that the statutes were excessively broad and susceptible of application in violation of those rights, and were being used by appellees in bad faith, not to secure valid convictions, but to deter appellants' civil rights efforts. Appellants alleged and offered to prove the arrest of the individual appellants under the statutes, the raiding of their offices and illegal seizure of their records, with continued threats of prosecution after invalidation by a state court of the arrests and seizure of evidence preceding this action. A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, also holding that abstention was appropriate pending a possible narrowing construction by the state courts which would avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. Thereafter, appellants alleged, the individual appellants were indicted under the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law. They also claimed that there was no prospect of final state adjudications either under those indictments or under threatened additional prosecutions. Held:\n\n 1. The mere possibility of erroneous initial application of constitutional standards by a state court will not ordinarily constitute irreparable injury warranting federal interference with a good-faith prosecution and the adjudication during its course of constitutional defenses. Pp. 484-485. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 2. But equitable relief will be granted to prevent a substantial loss or impairment of freedoms of expression resulting from prosecution under an excessively broad statute regulating expression. Pp. 485-489.\n\n\n  (a) Defense of a criminal prosecution will not generally assure ample vindication of First Amendment rights. Baggett v. Bullitt. \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, followed. Pp. 485-486.\n\n\n  (b) A chilling effect upon First Amendment rights might result from such prosecution regardless of its prospects of success or failure, as is indicated by appellants' representations of the actions taken under the statutes. Pp. 487-489.\n\n\n 3. The abstention doctrine is inappropriate where a statute is justifiably attacked on its face, or as applied for the purpose of discouraging protected activities. Pp. 489-491.\n\n\n  (a) The state court's ultimate interpretation of a statute would be irrelevant to meet the claim that it was being applied to discourage civil rights activities. P. 490.\n\n\n  (b) Abstention is inappropriate where a statute regulating speech is properly attacked on its face as being unconstitutionally vague. Pp. 490-491.\n\n\n  (c) Appellants are entitled to an injunction where, as here, no readily apparent construction is available to bring the statute within constitutional confines in a single prosecution, and it is not alleged that their conduct would fall within any conceivable narrowing construction. P. 491.\n\n\n  (d) The State must assume the burden of securing a permissible narrow construction of the statute in a noncriminal proceeding before it may seek modification of the injunction to permit future prosecutions thereunder. P. 491.\n\n\n 4. The statutory definition of \"a subversive organization\" in 359 (5) of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law, incorporated in the offense created by 364 (4), under which two of the individual appellants were indicted, results in an overly broad regulation of speech, invalid for the same reasons as held in Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, which involved a substantially similar definition. Pp. 493-494.\n\n\n 5. Section 364 (7), creating an offense for failure to register as a member of a \"Communist Front Organization,\" under which each of the individual defendants was indicted, is on its face invalid because of its constitutionally impermissible presumption of such status if the organization had been cited as a Communist front \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n by designated federal instrumentalities, there being no requirement in the statute of compliance in the process of such citation with procedural safeguards as demanded by Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123\n. Pp. 494-496.\n\n\n 6. The District Court shall enjoin prosecution of the pending indictments against the individual appellants, order immediate return of documents seized and prohibit further enforcement of the sections of the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law here found void on their face. Without abstention, it shall decide what relief appellants may be entitled to on the basis of their attacks on other sections of that statute, their attacks on the Communist Propaganda Control Law, and the remaining issues raised in the complaint. Pp. 497-495.\n\n\n 227 F. Supp. 556, reversed and remanded.\n\nLeon Hubert and Arthur Kinoy argued the cause for appellants. With them on the brief were William M. Kunstler, Michael J. Kunstler and A. P. Tureaud.\n\nJohn E. Jackson, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana, and Jack N. Rogers argued the cause for appellees. With them on the brief for appellees Pfister et al. were Jack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana, and Dorothy D. Wolbrettee, Assistant Attorney General. With Mr. Rogers on the brief for appellee Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities was Robert H. Reiter. Mr. Reiter also filed a brief for appellee Davis. Appellee Jim Garrison filed a brief pro se.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging reversal, were filed by Jack Greenberg, Derrick A. Bell, Jr., and Jay H. Topkis for the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund; by Louis Lusky and Melvin L. Wulf for the American Civil Liberties Union et al.; and by Ernest Goodman and David Rein for the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellants filed a complaint in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, invoking the Civil \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n Rights Act, Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1958 ed.), and seeking declaratory relief and an injunction restraining appellees - the Governor, police and law enforcement officers, and the Chairman of the Legislative Joint Committee on Un-American Activities in Louisiana - from prosecuting or threatening to prosecute appellants for alleged violations of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and the Communist Propaganda Control Law.\n1\n Appellant Southern Conference Educational Fund, Inc. (SCEF), is active in fostering civil rights for Negroes in Louisiana and other States of the South. Appellant Dombrowski is its Executive Director; intervenor Smith, its Treasurer; and intervenor Waltzer, Smith's law partner and an attorney for SCEF. The complaint alleges that the statutes on their face violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees securing freedom of expression, because overbreadth makes them susceptible of sweeping and improper application abridging those rights. Supported by affidavits and a written offer of proof, the complaint further alleges that the threats to enforce the statutes against appellants are not made with any expectation of securing valid convictions, but rather are part of a plan to employ arrests, seizures, and threats of prosecution under color of the statutes to harass appellants and discourage them and their supporters from asserting and attempting to vindicate the constitutional rights of Negro citizens of Louisiana.\n\nA three-judge district court, convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 (1958 ed.), dismissed the complaint, one judge dissenting, \"for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" 227 F. Supp. 556, 564. The majority \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n were of the view that the allegations, conceded to raise serious constitutional issues, did not present a case of threatened irreparable injury to federal rights which warranted cutting short the normal adjudication of constitutional defenses in the course of state criminal prosecutions; rather, the majority held, this was an appropriate case for abstention, since a possible narrowing construction by the state courts would avoid unnecessary decision of constitutional questions. In accordance with this view the court withdrew its initial determination that the statutes were not unconstitutional on their face. 227 F. Supp., at 562-563. Postponement of consideration of the federal issues until state prosecution and possible review here of adverse state determination was thought to be especially appropriate since the statutes concerned the State's \"basic right of self-preservation\" and the threatened prosecution was \"imbued . . . . with an aura of sedition or treason or acts designed to substitute a different form of local government by other than lawful means . . .\"; federal court interference with enforcement of such statutes \"truly . . . would be a massive emasculation of the last vestige of the dignity of sovereignty.\" 227 F. Supp., at 559, 560. We noted probable jurisdiction in order to resolve a seeming conflict with our later decision in Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, and to settle important questions concerning federal injunctions against state criminal prosecutions threatening constitutionally protected expression. \n377 \nU.S. 976\n. We reverse.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, the fountainhead of federal injunctions against state prosecutions, the Court characterized the power and its proper exercise in broad terms: it would be justified where state officers \". . . threaten and are about to commence proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n affected an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution . . . .\" \n209 \nU.S., at 156\n. Since that decision, however, considerations of federalism have tempered the exercise of equitable power,\n2\n for the Court has recognized that federal interference with a State's good-faith administration of its criminal laws is peculiarly inconsistent with our federal framework. It is generally to be assumed that state courts and prosecutors will observe constitutional limitations as expounded by this Court, and that the mere possibility of erroneous initial application \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n of constitutional standards will usually not amount to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state proceedings. In Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n, for example, the Court upheld a district court's refusal to enjoin application of a city ordinance to religious solicitation, even though the ordinance was that very day held unconstitutional as so applied on review of a criminal conviction under it. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n. Since injunctive relief looks to the future, and it was not alleged that Pennsylvania courts and prosecutors would fail to respect the Murdock ruling, the Court found nothing to justify an injunction. And in a variety of other contexts the Court has found no special circumstances to warrant cutting short the normal adjudication of constitutional defenses in the course of a criminal prosecution.\n3\n In such cases it does not appear that the plaintiffs \"have been threatened with any injury other than that incidental to every criminal proceeding brought lawfully and in good faith, or that a federal court of equity by withdrawing the determination of guilt from the state courts could rightly afford petitioners any protection which they could not secure by prompt trial and appeal pursued to this Court.\" Douglas v. City of Jeannette, supra, at 164.\n\nBut the allegations in this complaint depict a situation in which defense of the State's criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitutional rights. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n They suggest that a substantial loss or impairment of freedoms of expression will occur if appellants must await the state court's disposition and ultimate review in this Court of any adverse determination. These allegations, if true, clearly show irreparable injury.\n\nA criminal prosecution under a statute regulating expression usually involves imponderables and contingencies that themselves may inhibit the full exercise of First Amendment freedoms. See, e. g., Smith v. California. \n361 \nU.S. 147\n. When the statutes also have an overbroad sweep, as is here alleged, the hazard of loss or substantial impairment of those precious rights may be critical. For in such cases, the statutes lend themselves too readily to denial of those rights. The assumption that defense of a criminal prosecution will generally assure ample vindication of constitutional rights is unfounded in such cases. See Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 379. For \"[t]he threat of sanctions may deter . . . almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions. . . .\" NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 433\n. Because of the sensitive nature of constitutionally protected expression, we have not required that all of those subject to overbroad regulations risk prosecution to test their rights. For free expression - of transcendent value to all society, and not merely to those exercising their rights - might be the loser. Cf. Garrison v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 64, 74\n-75. For example, we have consistently allowed attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 97\n-98; NAACP v. Button, supra, at 432-433; cf. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500, 515\n-517; United States v. Raines, \n362 \nU.S. 17, 21\n-22. We have fashioned this exception to the usual rules governing standing, see United States v. Raines, supra, because of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n the \". . . danger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application.\" NAACP v. Button, supra, at 433. If the rule were otherwise, the contours of regulation would have to be hammered out case by case - and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the proper scope of regulation. Cf. Ex parte Young, supra, at 147-148. By permitting determination of the invalidity of these statutes without regard to the permissibility of some regulation on the facts of particular cases, we have, in effect, avoided making vindication of freedom of expression await the outcome of protracted litigation. Moreover, we have not thought that the improbability of successful prosecution makes the case different. The chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights may derive from the fact of the prosecution, unaffected by the prospects of its success or failure. See NAACP v. Button, supra, at 432-433; cf. Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 378-379; Bush v. Orleans School Board, 194 F. Supp. 182, 185, affirmed sub nom. Tugwell v. Bush, \n367 \nU.S. 907\n; Gremillion v. United States, \n368 \nU.S. 11\n.\n\nAppellants' allegations and offers of proof outline the chilling effect on free expression of prosecutions initiated and threatened in this case. Early in October 1963 appellant Dombrowski and intervenors Smith and Waltzer were arrested by Louisiana state and local police and charged with violations of the two statutes. Their offices were raided and their files and records seized.\n4\n Later in October a state judge quashed the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n arrest warrants as not based on probable cause, and discharged the appellants. Subsequently, the court granted a motion to suppress the seized evidence on the ground that the raid was illegal. Louisiana officials continued, however, to threaten prosecution of the appellants, who thereupon filed this action in November. Shortly after the three-judge court was convened, a grand jury was summoned in the Parish of Orleans to hear evidence looking to indictments of the individual appellants. On appellants' application Judge Wisdom issued a temporary restraining order against prosecutions pending hearing and decision of the case in the District Court. Following a hearing the District Court, over Judge Wisdom's dissent, dissolved the temporary restraining order and, at the same time, handed down an order dismissing the complaint. Thereafter the grand jury returned indictments under the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law against the individual appellants.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThese events, together with repeated announcements by appellees that the appellant organization is a subversive or Communist-front organization, whose members must register or be prosecuted under the Louisiana statutes. have, appellants allege, frightened off potential members and contributors. Cf. Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123\n. Seizures of documents and records have paralyzed operations and threatened exposure of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n identity of adherents to a locally unpopular cause. See NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n. Although the particular seizure has been quashed in the state courts, the continuing threat of prosecution portends further arrests and seizures, some of which may be upheld and all of which will cause the organization inconvenience or worse. In Freedman v. Maryland, ante, p. 51, we struck down a motion picture censorship statute solely because the regulatory scheme did not sufficiently assure exhibitors a prompt judicial resolution of First Amendment claims. The interest in immediate resolution of such claims is surely no less where criminal prosecutions are threatened under statutes allegedly overbroad and seriously inhibiting the exercise of protected freedoms. Not only does the complaint allege far more than an \"injury other than that incidental to every criminal proceeding brought lawfully and in good faith,\" but appellants allege threats to enforce statutory provisions other than those under which indictments have been brought. Since there is no immediate prospect of a final state adjudication as to those other sections - if, indeed, there is any certainty that prosecution of the pending indictments will resolve all constitutional issues presented - a series of state criminal prosecutions will not provide satisfactory resolution of constitutional issues.\n\nIt follows that the District Court erred in holding that the complaint fails to allege sufficient irreparable injury to justify equitable relief.\n\nThe District Court also erred in holding that it should abstain pending authoritative interpretation of the statutes in the state courts, which might hold that they did not apply to SCEF, or that they were unconstitutional as applied to SCEF. We hold the abstention doctrine is inappropriate for cases such as the present one where, unlike Douglas v. City of Jeannette, statutes are justifiably \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 490]\n\u00a0\n attacked on their face as abridging free expression, or as applied for the purpose of discouraging protected activities.\n\nFirst, appellants have attacked the good faith of the appellees in enforcing the statutes, claiming that they have invoked, and threaten to continue to invoke, criminal process without any hope of ultimate success, but only to discourage appellants' civil rights activities. If these allegations state a claim under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1983, as we believe they do, see Beauregard v. Wingard, 230 F. Supp. 167 (D.C. S. D. Calif. 1964); Bargainer v. Michal, 233 F. Supp. 270 (D.C. N. D. Ohio 1964), the interpretation ultimately put on the statutes by the state courts is irrelevant. For an interpretation rendering the statute inapplicable to SCEF would merely mean that appellants might ultimately prevail in the state courts. It would not alter the impropriety of appellees' invoking the statute in bad faith to impose continuing harassment in order to discourage appellants' activities, as appellees allegedly are doing and plan to continue to do.\n\nSecond, appellants have challenged the statutes as overly broad and vague regulations of expression. We have already seen that where, as here, prosecutions are actually threatened, this challenge, if not clearly frivolous, will establish the threat of irreparable injury required by traditional doctrines of equity. We believe that in this case the same reasons preclude denial of equitable relief pending an acceptable narrowing construction. In considering whether injunctive relief should be granted, a federal district court should consider a statute as of the time its jurisdiction is invoked, rather than some hypothetical future date. The area of proscribed conduct will be adequately defined and the deterrent effect of the statute contained within constitutional limits only by authoritative constructions sufficiently illuminating the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n contours of an otherwise vague prohibition. As we observed in Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 378, this cannot be satisfactorily done through a series of criminal prosecutions, dealing as they inevitably must with only a narrow portion of the prohibition at any one time, and not contributing materially to articulation of the statutory standard. We believe that those affected by a statute are entitled to be free of the burdens of defending prosecutions, however expeditious, aimed at hammering out the structure of the statute piecemeal, with no likelihood of obviating similar uncertainty for others. Here, no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution, and appellants are entitled to an injunction. The State must, if it is to invoke the statutes after injunctive relief has been sought, assume the burden of obtaining a permissible narrow construction in a noncriminal proceeding\n6\n before it may seek modification of the injunction to permit future prosecutions.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nOn this view of the \"vagueness\" doctrine, it is readily apparent that abstention serves no legitimate purpose where a statute regulating speech is properly attacked on its face, and where, as here, the conduct charged in the indictments is not within the reach of an acceptable limiting construction readily to be anticipated as the result of a single criminal prosecution and is not the sort of \"hard-core\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 492]\n\u00a0\n conduct that would obviously be prohibited under any construction. In these circumstances, to abstain is to subject those affected to the uncertainties and vagaries of criminal prosecution, whereas the reasons for the vagueness doctrine in the area of expression demand no less than freedom from prosecution prior to a construction adequate to save the statute. In such cases, abstention is at war with the purposes of the vagueness doctrine, which demands appropriate federal relief regardless of the prospects for expeditious determination of state criminal prosecutions. Although we hold today that appellants' allegations of threats to prosecute, if upheld. dictate appropriate equitable relief without awaiting declaratory judgments in the state courts, the settled rule of our cases is that district courts retain power to modify injunctions in light of changed circumstances. System Federation v. Wright, \n364 \nU.S. 642\n; Chrysler Corp. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 556\n; United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106\n. Our view of the proper operation of the vagueness doctrine does not preclude district courts from modifying injunctions to permit prosecutions in light of subsequent state court interpretation clarifying the application of a statute to particular conduct.\n\nWe conclude that on the allegations of the complaint. if true, abstention and the denial of injunctive relief may well result in the denial of any effective safeguards against the loss of protected freedoms of expression, and cannot be justified.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nEach of the individual appellants was indicted for violating 364 (7)\n8\n of the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law by failing to register as a member of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 493]\n\u00a0\n a Communist-front organization. Smith and Waltzer were indicted for failing to register as members \"of a Communist front organization known as the National Lawyers Guild, which said organization has been cited by committees and sub-committees of the United States Congress as a Communist front organization . . . .\" Dombrowski and Smith were indicted for failing to register as members of \"a Communist front organization known as the Southern Conference Educational Fund, which said organization is essentially the same as the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which said Southern Conference for Human Welfare [has] . . . been cited by the committees of the United States Congress as a Communist front organization . . . .\" Dombrowski and Smith were also indicted for violating 364 (4),\n9\n by acting as Executive Director and Treasurer respectively \"of a subversive organization, to wit, the Southern Conference Educational Fund, said organization being essentially the same as the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which said organization has been cited by committees of the United States Congress as a Communist front organization . . . .\"\n\nThe statutory definition of \"a subversive organization\" in 359 (5)\n10\n incorporated in the offense created by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 494]\n\u00a0\n 364 (4), is substantially identical to that of the Washington statute which we considered in Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 362, 363, n. 1. There the definition was used in a state statute requiring state employees to take an oath as a condition of employment. We held that the definition, as well as the oath based thereon, denied due process because it was unduly vague, uncertain and broad. Where, as here, protected freedoms of expression and association are similarly involved, we see no controlling distinction in the fact that the definition is used to provide a standard of criminality rather than the contents of a test oath. This overly broad statute also creates a \"danger zone\" within which protected expression may be inhibited. Cf. Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 526\n. So long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one. Even the prospect of ultimate failure of such prosecutions by no means dispels their chilling effect on protected expression. A Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas, \n378 \nU.S. 205\n; Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, \n372 \nU.S. 58\n; Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717\n; Speiser v. Randall, supra. Since 364 (4) is so intimately bound up with a definition invalid under the reasoning of Baggett v. Bullitt, we hold that it is invalid for the same reasons.\n\nWe also find the registration requirement of 364 (7) invalid. That section creates an offense of failure to register as a member of a Communist-front organization, and, under 359 (3),\n11\n \"the fact that an organization has \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 495]\n\u00a0\n been officially cited or identified by the Attorney General of the United States, the Subversive Activities Control Board of the United States or any committee or subcommittee of the United States Congress as a . . . communist front organization . . . shall be considered presumptive evidence of the factual status of any such organization.\" There is no requirement that the organization be so cited only after compliance with the procedural safeguards demanded by Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, supra.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 496]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA designation resting on such safeguards is a minimum requirement to insure the rationality of the presumptions of the Louisiana statute and, in its absence, the presumptions cast an impermissible burden upon the appellants to show that the organizations are not Communist fronts. \"Where the transcendent value of speech is involved, due process certainly requires . . . that the State bear the burden of persuasion to show that the appellants engaged in criminal speech.\" Speiser v. Randall, supra, at 526. It follows that 364 (7), resting on the invalid presumption, is unconstitutional on its face.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe precise terms and scope of the injunctive relief to which appellants are entitled and the identity of the appellees to be enjoined cannot, of course, be determined until after the District Court conducts the hearing on remand. The record suffices, however, to permit this Court to hold that, without the benefit of limiting construction, the statutory provisions on which the indictments are founded are void on their face; until an acceptable limiting construction is obtained, the provisions cannot be applied to the activities of SCEF, whatever they may be. The brief filed in this Court by appellee Garrison, District Attorney of the Parish of Orleans, the official having immediate responsibility for the indictments, concedes the facts concerning the arrests of the individual appellants, their discharge by the local judge, and the indictments of the individual appellants by the grand jury. In view of our decision on the merits, the District Court on remand need decide only the relief to which appellants may be entitled on the basis of their attacks on other sections of that statute and the Communist Propaganda Control Law, and on their allegations that appellees threaten to enforce both statutes solely to discourage appellants from continuing their civil rights activities. On these issues, abstention will be as inappropriate as on the issues we here decide.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. These shall include prompt framing of a decree restraining prosecution of the pending indictments against the individual appellants, ordering immediate return of all papers and documents seized, and prohibiting further acts enforcing the sections of the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law here found void \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 498]\n\u00a0\n on their face. In addition, appellants are entitled to expeditious determination, without abstention, of the remaining issues raised in the complaint.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law is La. Rev. Stat. 14:358 through 14:374 (Cum. Supp. 1962). The Communist Propaganda Control Law is La. Rev. Stat. 14:390 through 14:390.8 (Cum. Supp. 1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 28 U.S.C. 2283 (1958 ed.) provides that: \"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\" The District Court did not suggest that this statute denied power to issue the injunctions sought. This statute and its predecessors do not preclude injunctions against the institution of state court proceedings, but only bar stays of suits already instituted. See Ex parte Young, supra. See generally Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 366-378 (1930); Note, Federal Power to Enjoin State Court Proceedings, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 726, 728-729 (1961). Since the grand jury was not convened and indictments were not obtained until after the filing of the complaint, which sought interlocutory as well as permanent relief, no state \"proceedings\" were pending within the intendment of 2283. To hold otherwise would mean that any threat of prosecution sufficient to justify equitable intervention would also be a \"proceeding\" for 2283. Nor are the subsequently obtained indictments \"proceedings\" against which injunctive relief is precluded by 2283. The indictments were obtained only because the District Court erroneously dismissed the complaint and dissolved the temporary restraining order issued by Judge Wisdom in aid of the jurisdiction of the District Court properly invoked by the complaint. We therefore find it unnecessary to resolve the question whether suits under 42 U.S.C. 1983 (1958 ed.) come under the \"expressly authorized\" exception to 2283. Compare Cooper v. Hutchinson, 184 F.2d 119, 124 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1950), with Smith v. Village of Lansing, 241 F.2d 856, 859 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1957). See Note, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 726, 738 (1961).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Beal v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 45\n (mere threat of single prosecution); Spielman Motor Sales Co., Inc. v.

It is difficult to think of a case in which an accused could properly bring a state prosecution to a halt while a federal court decides his claim that certain evidence is rendered inadmissible by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Cleary v. Bolger, \n371 \nU.S. 392\n; Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The circumstances of the arrests are set forth in Judge Wisdom's dissenting opinion: \"At gunpoint their homes and offices were raided and ransacked by police officers and trustees from the House of Detention acting under the direct supervision of the staff director and the counsel for the State Un-American Activities Committee. The home and office of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n the director of Southern Conference Educational Fund were also raided. Among the dangerous articles removed was Thoreau's Journal. A truckload of files, membership lists, subscription lists to SCEF's newspaper, correspondence, and records were removed from SCEF's office, destroying its capacity to function. At the time of the arrests, Mr. Pfister, Chairman of the Committee, announced to the press that the raids and arrest resulted from `racial agitation.'\" 227 F. Supp., at 573.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Prosecution under these indictments is awaiting decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Thirty-seven States, including Louisiana, have adopted the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. The Louisiana version, La. Civ. Proc. Code Ann., 1960, Arts. 1871-1883, abolishes the former requirement that there be no other adequate remedy.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Our cases indicate that once an acceptable limiting construction is obtained, it may be applied to conduct occurring prior to the construction, see Poulos v. New Hampshire, \n345 \nU.S. 395\n; Cox v. New Hampshire, \n312 \nU.S. 569\n; Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507\n, provided such application affords fair warning to the defendants, see Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n; cf. Harrison v. NAACP, \n360 \nU.S. 167, 179\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 364 (7) provides: \"It shall be a felony for any person knowingly and wilfully to . . .

S. 14:360 or to make any registration which contains any material false statement or omission.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Section 364 (4) provides: \"It shall be a felony for any person knowingly and wilfully to . . . [a]ssist in the formation or participate in the management or to contribute to the support of any subversive organization or foreign subversive organization knowing said organization to be a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Section 359 (5) provides: \"Subversive organization' means any organization which engages in or advocates, abets, advises, or teaches, or a purpose of which is to engage in or advocate, abet, advise, or teach activities intended to overthrow, destroy, or to assist in the overthrow or destruction of the constitutional form of the government of the state of Louisiana, or of any political subdivision thereof by revolution, force, violence or other unlawful means, or any other organization \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 494]\n\u00a0\n which seeks by unconstitutional or illegal means to overthrow or destroy the government of the state of Louisiana or any political subdivision thereof and to establish in place thereof any form of government not responsible to the people of the state of Louisiana under the Constitution of the state of Louisiana.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Section 359 (3) provides: \"`Communist Front Organization' shall, for the purpose of this act include any communist action organization, communist front organization, communist infiltrated \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 495]\n\u00a0\n organization or communist controlled organization and the fact that an organization has been officially cited or identified by the Attorney General of the United States, the Subversive Activities Control Board of the United States or any committee or subcommittee of the United States Congress as a communist organization, a communist action organization, a communist front organization, a communist infiltrated organization or has been in any other way officially cited or identified by any of these aforementioned authorities as a communist controlled organization, shall be considered presumptive evidence of the factual status of any such organization.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Although we hold the statute void on its face, its application to the National Lawyers Guild is instructive. In 1953, the Attorney General of the United States proposed to designate the organization as subversive. His proposal was made under revised regulations, promulgated under Executive Order 10450 to comply with Anti-Fascist Committee, establishing a notice and hearing procedure prior to such designation of an organization. 18 Fed. Reg. 2619; see 1954 Annual Report of the Attorney General, p. 14. The Guild brought an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia attacking the Executive Order and the procedures. A summary judgment in favor of the Attorney General because of failure to exhaust administrative remedies was sustained on appeal and this Court denied certiorari, National Lawyers Guild v. Brownell, 96 U.S. App. D.C. 252, 225 F.2d 552, cert. denied, \n351 \nU.S. 927\n. After a Hearing Officer determined that certain interrogatories propounded to the Guild should be answered, the Guild brought another action in the District Court, National Lawyers Guild v. Rogers, Civil Action No. 1738-58, filed July 2, 1958. On September 11, 1958, the Attorney General rescinded the proposal to designate the Guild. 1958 Annual Report of the Attorney General, p. 251. On September 12, 1958, the complaint \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 496]\n\u00a0\n was dismissed as moot at the instance of the Attorney General, who filed a motion reciting the rescission and stating that the Attorney General had \"concluded that the evidence that would now be available at a hearing on the merits of the proposed designation fails to meet the strict standards of proof which guide the determination of proceedings of this character.\" The present federal statutes provide that the Subversive Activities Control Board may not designate an organization as a Communist front without first according the organization the procedural safeguards of notice and hearing. Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 13, 64 Stat. 998, 50 U.S.C. 792 (1958 ed.). See Communist Party v. SACB, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Although we read appellee Garrison's brief as conceding that appellants' files and records were seized in aid of the prosecutions under the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law, we find no concession that the seizure, as alleged in appellants' offer of proof, was also under color of the Communist Propaganda Control Law. Section 390.6 of that statute authorizes the seizure and destruction on summary process of \"[a]ll communist propaganda discovered in the state of Louisiana\" in violation of the other provisions of the Act, and 390.2 makes it a felony to disseminate such material. \"Communist propaganda\" is defined in 390.1, which contains a presumption identical to that which we have found to be invalid in 359 (3) of the Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law. In light of the uncertain state of the record, however, we believe that the appellants' attacks upon the constitutionality, on its face and as applied, of the Communist Propaganda Control Law should await determination by the District Court after considering the sufficiency of threats to enforce the law.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nThe basic holding in this case marks a significant departure from a wise procedural principle designed to spare our federal system from premature federal judicial interference with state statutes or proceedings challenged on federal constitutional grounds. This decision abolishes the doctrine of federal judicial abstention in all suits attacking state criminal statutes for vagueness on First-Fourteenth Amendment grounds. As one who considers that it is a prime responsibility of this Court to maintain federal-state court relationships in good working order, I cannot subscribe to a holding which displays such insensitivity to the legitimate demands of those relationships under our federal system. I see no such incompatibility between the abstention doctrine and the full vindication of constitutionally protected rights as the Court finds to exist in cases of this kind.\n\nIn practical effect the Court's decision means that a State may no longer carry on prosecutions under statutes challengeable for vagueness on \"First Amendment\" grounds without the prior approval of the federal courts. For if such a statute can be so questioned (and few, at least colorably, cannot) then a state prosecution, if instituted \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 499]\n\u00a0\n after the commencement of a federal action,\n1\n must be halted until the prosecuting authorities obtain in some other state proceeding a narrowing construction, which in turn would presumably be subject to further monitoring by the federal courts before the state prosecution would be allowed to proceed.\n\nFor me such a paralyzing of state criminal processes cannot be justified by any of the considerations which the Court's opinion advances in its support. High as the premium placed on First Amendment rights may be, I do not think that the Federal Constitution prevents a State from testing their availability through the medium of criminal proceedings, subject of course to this Court's ultimate review.\n\nUnderlying the Court's major premise that criminal enforcement of an overly broad statute affecting rights of speech and association is in itself a deterrent to the free exercise thereof seems to be the unarticulated assumption that state courts will not be as prone as federal courts to vindicate constitutional rights promptly and effectively. Such an assumption should not be indulged in the absence of a showing that such is apt to be so in a given case. No showing of that kind has been made. On the contrary, the Louisiana courts in this very case have already refused to uphold the seizure of appellants' books. Ante, pp. 487-488. We should not assume that those courts would not be equally diligent in construing the statutes here in question in accordance with the relevant decisions of this Court.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court suggests that \"a substantial loss or impairment of freedoms of expression will occur if appellants must await the state court's disposition and ultimate review in this Court of any adverse determination.\" Ante, p. 486. But the possibility of such an impairment is not obviated by traveling the federal route approved here. Even in the federal courts the progress of litigation is not always as swift as one would like to see it. It is true, of course, that appellants would have to show in the state case that the conduct charged falls outside the scope of a criminal statute construed within constitutional limits, whereas in this case they need not allege the particular conduct which they deem to be protected. But the argument that these state prosecutions do not afford an appropriate vehicle for testing appellants' claims respecting freedom of speech and association hardly sits well with the Smith Act cases in which First Amendment claims were at the very core of the federal prosecutions. See Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n; Yates v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 298\n; Scales v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 203\n.\n\nBaggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, in which the Court last Term struck down a Washington state statute virtually identical to this one, should not be dispositive of this case. Baggett was decided in the context of what amounted to an academic loyalty oath, applicable to college professors with respect to some of whom (those not having tenure) there was at least grave doubt whether a state remedy was available to review the constitutionality of their dismissal by reason of refusal to take the required oath. I would not extend the doctrine of that case to thwart the normal processes of state criminal law enforcement.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 501]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHad this statute been a federal enactment and had this Court been willing to pass upon its validity in a declaratory judgment or injunction action, I can hardly believe that it would have stricken the statute without first exposing it to the process of narrowing construction in an effort to save as much of it as possible. See, e. g., Dennis v. United States, supra, at 502. Yet here the Court has not only made no effort to give this state statute a narrowing construction, but has also declined to give the Louisiana courts an opportunity to do so with respect to the acts charged in the pending prosecutions against these appellants. See Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273\n; Poulos v. New Hampshire, \n345 \nU.S. 395\n. The statute thus pro tanto goes to its doom without either state or federal court interpretation, and despite the room which the statute clearly leaves for a narrowing constitutional construction. See Dennis, Yates, and Scales, supra. This seems to me to be heavy-handed treatment of the first order.\n\nWhat the Court decides suffers from a further infirmity. Interwoven with the vagueness doctrine is a question of standing. In a criminal prosecution a defendant could not avoid a constitutional application of this statute to his own conduct simply by showing that if applied to others whose conduct was protected it would be unconstitutional.\n4\n To follow that practice in a federal court which \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 502]\n\u00a0\n is asked to enjoin a state criminal prosecution would, however, in effect require that the parties try the criminal case in advance in the federal forum, see Cleary v. Bolger, \n371 \nU.S. 392\n; Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117, 123\n-124, a procedure certainly seriously disruptive of the orderly processes of the state proceedings. The Court seems to recognize that persons whose conduct would be included under even the narrowest reading of the statutes - what might be called \"hard-core\" conduct - could have been constitutionally prosecuted under the statutes invalidated today, without being able to assert a vagueness defense. Ante, n. 7; pp. 491-492. Thus, if persons were conspiring to stage a forcible coup d'etat in a State, they could hardly claim in a criminal trial that a statute such as this was vague as applied to them. For all we know, appellants' conduct in fact would fall within even the narrowest reading of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law, but since appellants were able to reach a federal court before the State instituted criminal proceedings against them, they are now immunized with a federal vaccination from state prosecution. To make standing and criminality turn on which party wins the race to the forum of its own choice is to repudiate the \"considerations of federalism\" (ante, p. 484) to which the Court pays lip service.\n\nWhile I consider that abstention was called for, I think the District Court erred in dismissing the action. It should have retained jurisdiction for the purpose of affording appellants appropriate relief in the event that the state prosecution did not go forward in a prompt and bona fide manner. See Harrison v. NAACP, \n360 \nU.S. 167\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] If the state criminal prosecution were instituted first, a federal court could not enjoin the state action. 28 U.S.C. 2283 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Moreover, it is not unlikely that the Louisiana courts would construe these statutes so as to obviate the problems of vagueness noted by the Court in Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360\n, with regard to a similar Washington statute. Compare Douglas v. City of Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n, and Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, ante, p. 485.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In this case appellants are pursuing a consistent course of conduct, and the only question is whether the Louisiana statutes apply \n\n[380 \nU.S. 479, 501]\n\u00a0\n to such conduct. Thus, this case comes within the \"bulk of abstention cases in this Court . . . [where] the unsettled issue of state law principally concerned the applicability of the challenged statute to a certain person or a defined course of conduct, whose resolution in a particular manner would eliminate the constitutional issue and terminate the litigation.\" Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 376-377. The present case is indistinguishable from Harrison v. NAACP, \n360 \nU.S. 167\n, and Albertson v. Millard, \n345 \nU.S. 242\n, as explained in Baggett, supra, at 376, n. 13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L.

The alleged accomplice was called as a state witness in petitioner's trial but repeatedly refused on self-incrimination grounds to testify. Under the guise of cross-examining the accomplice as a hostile witness, the prosecutor, over petitioner's objections and despite the accomplice's continuing refusal to answer, read in the presence of the jury the latter's purported confession which implicated the petitioner. Three law enforcement officers then identified the document as the confession signed by the accomplice though it was not offered in evidence. The jury found petitioner guilty. Held:\n\n 1. Petitioner's inability to cross-examine the alleged accomplice about the purported confession, the prosecutor's reading of which may well have been treated by the jury as substantial and cogent evidence of guilt, denied petitioner the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment which is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth. Pointer v. Texas, ante, p. 400, followed. Pp. 418-420.\n\n\n 2. The opportunity to cross-examine the law enforcement officers did not redress denial of petitioner's right of confrontation. Pp. 419-420.\n\n\n 3. Petitioner's objections to the reading of the purported confession adequately preserved his claim of denial of a federal constitutional right regardless of their adequacy under state law as construed by the state appellate court. Pp. 420-423.\n\n\n 42 Ala. App. 314, 163 So.2d 477, reversed and remanded.\n\nCharles Cleveland argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Bryan A. Chancey and Robert S. Gordon.\n\nPaul T. Gish, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of Alabama, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Richmond M. Flowers, Attorney General of Alabama. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner and one Loyd were tried separately in Alabama's Circuit Court on charges of assault with intent to murder. Loyd was tried first and was found guilty. The State then called Loyd as a witness at petitioner's trial. Because Loyd planned to appeal his conviction, his lawyer, who also represented petitioner, advised Loyd to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination and not to answer any questions. When Loyd was sworn, the lawyer objected, on self-incrimination grounds, \"to this witness appearing on the stand,\" but the objection was overruled. Loyd gave his name and address but, invoking the privilege, refused to answer any questions concerning the alleged crime. The trial judge ruled that Loyd could not rely on the privilege because of his conviction, and ordered him to answer, but Loyd persisted in his refusal.\n1\n The judge thereupon granted the State Solicitor's motion \"to declare [Loyd] a hostile witness and give me the privilege of cross-examination.\" The Solicitor then produced a document said to be a confession signed by Loyd. Under the guise of cross-examination to refresh Loyd's recollection, the Solicitor purported to read from the document, pausing after every few sentences to ask Loyd, in the presence of the jury, \"Did you make that statement?\" Each time, Loyd asserted the privilege and refused to answer, but the Solicitor continued this form of questioning until the entire document \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n had been read.\n2\n The Solicitor then called three law enforcement officers who identified the document as embodying a confession made and signed by Loyd. Although marked as an exhibit for identification, the document was not offered in evidence.\n\nThis procedure, petitioner argues, violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as applied to the States. The statements from the document as read by the Solicitor recited in considerable detail the circumstances leading to and surrounding the alleged crime; of crucial importance, they named the petitioner as the person who fired the shotgun blast which wounded the victim.\n3\n The jury found petitioner guilty. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals of Alabama affirmed, 42 Ala. App. 314, 163 So.2d 477. Although stating that Loyd's alleged confession was inadmissible in evidence against petitioner under state law because \"[t]here must be confrontation face to face to allow viva voice cross-examination before the jury,\" and noting that \"it might be claimed that the repeated and cumulative use of the confession might have been an indirect mode of getting the inadmissible confession in evidence.\" the Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction on the ground that petitioner's counsel had \"stopped objecting\" and that in that circumstance, \"the failure to object was waiver.\" 42 Ala. App., at 329, 332, 163 So.2d, at 493, 495. The Supreme Court of Alabama denied review, 276 Ala. 703, 163 So.2d 496. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 815\n. We reverse.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe decide today that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable to the States. Pointer v. Texas, ante, p. 400. Our cases construing the clause hold that a primary interest secured by it is the right of cross-examination; an adequate opportunity for cross-examination may satisfy the clause even in the absence of physical confrontation. As the Court said in Mattox v. United States,\n\n \"The primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or ex parte affidavits . . . being used against the prisoner \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\" \n156 \nU.S. 237, 242\n-243.\n\n\n See also 5 Wigmore, Evidence 1365, 1397 (3d ed. 1940); State v. Hester, 137 S. C. 145, 189, 134 S. E. 885, 900 (1926).\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, petitioner's inability to cross-examine Loyd as to the alleged confession plainly denied him the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause. Loyd's alleged statement that the petitioner fired the shotgun constituted the only direct evidence that he had done so; coupled with the description of the circumstances surrounding the shooting, this formed a crucial link in the proof both of petitioner's act and of the requisite intent to murder. Although the Solicitor's reading of Loyd's alleged statement, and Loyd's refusals to answer, were not technically testimony, the Solicitor's reading may well have been the equivalent in the jury's mind of testimony that Loyd in fact made the statement; and Loyd's reliance upon the privilege created a situation in which the jury might improperly infer both that the statement had been made and that it was true. Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551, 557\n-558; United States v. Maloney, 262 F.2d 535, 537 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1959). Since the Solicitor was not a witness, the inference from his reading that Loyd made the statement could not be tested by cross-examination. Similarly, Loyd could not be cross-examined on a statement imputed to but not admitted by him. Nor was the opportunity to cross-examine the law enforcement \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n officers adequate to redress this denial of the essential right secured by the Confrontation Clause. Indeed, their testimony enhanced the danger that the jury would treat the Solicitor's questioning of Loyd and Loyd's refusal to answer as proving the truth of Loyd's alleged confession. But since their evidence tended to show only that Loyd made the confession, cross-examination of them as to its genuineness could not substitute for cross-examination of Loyd to test the truth of the statement itself. Motes v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 458\n; cf. Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47\n.\n\nHence, effective confrontation of Loyd was possible only if Loyd affirmed the statement as his. However, Loyd did not do so, but relied on his privilege to refuse to answer. We need not decide whether Loyd properly invoked the privilege in light of his conviction. It is sufficient for the purposes of deciding petitioner's claim under the Confrontation Clause that no suggestion is made that Loyd's refusal to answer was procured by the petitioner, see Motes v. United States, supra, at 471; on this record it appears that Loyd was acting entirely in his own interests in doing so. This case cannot be characterized as one where the prejudice in the denial of the right of cross-examination constituted a mere minor lapse. The alleged statements clearly bore on a fundamental part of the State's case against petitioner. The circumstances are therefore such that \"inferences from a witness' refusal to answer added critical weight to the prosecution's case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\" Namet v. United States, \n373 \nU.S. 179, 187\n. See also Fletcher v. United States, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 137, 332 F.2d 724 (1964).\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe cannot agree with the Alabama Court of Appeals that petitioner's counsel waived the right to confrontation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n through failure to make sufficient objection to the reading of Loyd's alleged confession. The court stated: \"There must be a ruling sought and acted on before the trial judge can be put in error. Here there was no ruling asked or invoked as to the questions embracing the alleged confession.\" 42 Ala. App., at 332, 163 So.2d, at 495. Yet, as the colloquy set out in the margin shows, petitioner's counsel did object three times to the reading of the confession before the jury.\n4\n After the second time, the Solicitor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n assured him that he already had an objection in - plainly implying that further objection to the reading of the document was unnecessary. The ground for objection to later questions would have been the same, that the confession was being read to the jury. In light of this record it is difficult to understand the Court of Appeals' conclusion; nevertheless, accepting the finding as an authoritative interpretation of Alabama law, we follow our consistent holdings that the adequacy of state procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions is itself a federal question. See Wright v. Georgia, \n373 \nU.S. 284, 289\n-291. In determining the sufficiency of objections we have applied the general principle that an objection which is ample and timely to bring the alleged federal error to the attention of the trial court and enable it to take appropriate corrective action is sufficient to serve legitimate state interests, and therefore sufficient to preserve the claim for review here. Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n; Love v. Griffith, \n266 \nU.S. 32, 33\n-34. No legitimate state interest would have been served by requiring repetition of a patently futile objection, already thrice rejected, in a situation in which repeated objection might well affront the court or prejudice the jury beyond repair. Too, after the confession was read, the defense moved to exclude it; it then moved for a mistrial and for a new \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n trial; all three motions were denied. After two of the three law enforcement officers had testified, the defense renewed its objections to the hearsay references in Loyd's alleged confession and again was overruled. On these facts, it is clear that the defense brought the objection to the attention of the court at several points, at any of which corrective action could have been taken by stopping the questioning, excusing the jury, or excluding the evidence. To the extent that the Alabama rule requires objection after each and every question in this prolonged series, it is plainly inadequate to bar our review of the federal question presented.\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the result.\n\nFor reasons stated in the opinion of the Court, I agree that petitioner was denied a right of \"confrontation\" embodied in the concept of ordered liberty. I concur in the judgment of reversal on the premises stated in my opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, ante, p. 408, decided today.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Loyd had not been sentenced at the time of petitioner's trial. The trial judge initially threatened to hold Loyd in contempt for persisting in his refusal to answer after the judge had ruled that Loyd could not rely on the privilege since \"the jury has already determined your guilt.\" However, the judge did not proceed with the contempt citation but interrupted petitioner's trial to sentence Loyd to 20 years' imprisonment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There were 21 questions occupying seven pages in the printed record.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Two of the Solicitor's questions were as follows: \"Did you make the further statement, `We intended to shoot these trucks before they got to Centreville, but when we turned and went back north and passed the trucks again I was unable to bring myself to the point of shooting the trucks. After we passed the trucks this time we turned around and went south again toward Centreville, Alabama. These trucks were both stopped at a truck stop in Centreville where we passed them again and we proceeded on south on No. 5 about twenty miles. We sat alongside of the highway waiting for the trucks to come on and several trucks passed us, so we thought we ought to move before someone recognized us. We went back north again and saw a station wagon that looked suspicious so we turned off No. 5 onto 16. We drove over this route about six or eight miles and pulled in behind a church. We sat there for about five minutes and then heard what sounded like two trucks together going south on No. 5. We thought this was the two trucks and we went back to No. 5. When we got to No. 5 I told Douglas that I would drive and he said that was fine because I knew the car better than he. I drove on until we caught these trucks about five or eight miles above the junction of No. 5 and No. 80 and we passed them proceeding on to the junction where we turned around and headed back north to meet these trucks. Jesse Douglas was in the back seat with the automatic shotgun that belongs to B. F. Jackson and had it loaded with buckshot. He rolled down the window and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n when we passed these trucks he shot the lead truck as we passed them heading back north as they were coming south. We then went on to Highway 14, turned left and went into Greensboro, Alabama. We turned left in Greensboro on No. 69, drove south about five miles and realized we were going the wrong direction to go to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. We turned around and went back up to No. 69 to Tuscaloosa.' Did you make that statement?\" \"Were you asked the question, `How many shots were fired at the truck?' And your answer, `Only one.' Did you say that?\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The following occurred: \"Q. Is that your signature (showing witness signature on confession)? \"A. I'm not sure. \"Q.

Overrule. \"Mr. Esco: We except, if you please. \"Q.

And at this time, your Honor, we make a motion for a mistrial on the grounds that this jury has been so prejudiced from these proceedings, and from the attempts \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n of the prosecution to use illegal evidence, that no fair and just verdict whatsoever could come from a jury that has been so prejudiced. \"The Court: Motion is denied. \"Mr. Esco: We except, if you please. .  .  .  .   . \"Mr. Esco: We would like to make a motion for a new trial on the grounds that the proceedings have been very irregular here today and we feel that it has been prejudicial to this defendant. \"The Court: . . .

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the result.\n\nThe Court says that what happened in this case violated the petitioner's \"rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as applied to the States.\" I concur in the Court's judgment, because I think the petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This difference in view is, of course, far more than a matter of mere semantics. See my opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, ante, p. 409. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDREWS v.

Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nOn Sunday, September 6, 1959, Juretha Joyner and James L. Lacey, who are Negroes, and Helen W. Brown, Dale H. Drews and Joseph C. Sheeham, who are white, went to Gwynn Oak Park, an amusement park in Baltimore County, Maryland. Ironically, the park was celebrating \"All Nations Day.\" Shortly after 3 p. m. they \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 422]\n\u00a0\n were standing in a group by themselves and had, a park guard testified, attracted no attention from other patrons. The guard approached the group and told them that \"we are very sorry but the park was closed to colored, and that the colored people would have to leave the premises . . . .\" Mr. Lacey answered that he was enjoying himself and would like to look around some more, and neither he nor Miss Joyner complied with the request to leave. The guard then asked all five to leave, but they refused. He testified, however, that they \"were all very polite.\" During this interchange between the guard and petitioners, other patrons of the park began to gather around.\n\nUpon the refusal of petitioners to leave, the guard summoned the Baltimore County police, who, after asking petitioners to leave, placed them under arrest. Meanwhile, the crowd surrounding the petitioners grew larger and more hostile, even going so far as to kick, spit, and yell \"Lynch them!\" Neither the park officials nor the county police made any attempt to exclude from the park or arrest any of those who engaged in such conduct. Upon being informed of their arrest, the five joined arms briefly, and the three men then dropped to the ground and assumed a prostrate position. Petitioners Joyner and Brown remained on their feet. The police placed handcuffs on Miss Joyner, and escorted her and Miss Brown from the park. Though the police encountered some difficulty in pulling the women through the crowd, they left under their own power. The men, on the other hand, had to be carried out, but offered no active resistance. The only remark by any of the petitioners was made by one of the men, who, responding to mistreatment by someone in the crowd, said \". . . forgive him, he doesn't know what he is doing . . . .\"\n\nOn April 5, 1960, petitioners Brown, Joyner, Drews and Sheeham were charged with \"acting in a disorderly manner, to the disturbance of the public peace, at, in \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n or on Gwynn Oak Amusement Park, Inc., a body corporate, a place of public resort and amusement in Baltimore County\" in violation of Md. Code Ann. Art. 27, 123 (1957 ed.).\n2\n Mr. Lacey was not prosecuted. Petitioners waived jury trial, were found guilty by the court, and each was fined $25 plus costs.\n3\n On January 18, 1961, the Maryland Court of Appeals, defining disorderly conduct as \"the doing or saying, or both, of that which offends, disturbs, incites, or tends to incite, a number of people gathered in the same area,\"\n4\n affirmed the convictions. 224 Md. 186, 192, 167 A. 2d 341, 343-344. On June 22, 1964, this Court vacated the judgments and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration in light of Griffin v. Maryland, \n378 \nU.S. 130\n, and Bell v. Maryland, \n378 \nU.S. 226\n. \n378 \nU.S. 547\n. On remand, the Court of Appeals, purporting to distinguish Griffin and Bell, reinstated and reaffirmed the prior judgments of conviction, Judge Oppenheimer dissenting. 236 Md. 349, 204 A. 2d 64.\n\nI cannot concur in the Court's refusal to review this case. (1) There is in my mind serious question as to whether the conduct of petitioners can constitutionally be punished under a disorderly conduct statute. (2) It \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n seems to me apparent from the record that petitioners' conduct is protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, and that, under our decision in Hamm v. City of Rock Hill and Lupper v. Arkansas, \n379 \nU.S. 306\n, the passage of the Act must be deemed to have abated the convictions.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn Thompson v. Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n, the only evidence supporting the petitioner's disorderly conduct conviction was to the effect that, after being arrested on another charge, he was \"very argumentative\" with the arresting officers. We set aside the conviction on the ground that it was \"so totally devoid of evidentiary support as to render his conviction unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Ibid. Thompson was followed in Garner v. Louisiana, \n368 \nU.S. 157\n, where the evidence showed that the petitioners, who were Negroes, had taken seats at a lunch counter where only white people were served, and had refused to leave upon request. For this they were convicted of disturbing the peace. For purposes of our decision, we gave the statute under which the petitioners were convicted its broadest possible readings, and assumed that it outlawed even peaceful and orderly conduct which foreseeably might cause a public commotion, id., at 169. Nonetheless, we found the petitioners' conduct constitutionally insufficient to support the conviction.\n5\n And in Barr v. City of Columbia, \n378 \nU.S. 146\n, we reversed a breach of the peace conviction based on conduct \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n similar to that involved in Garner. In doing so, we observed that\n\n\"because of the frequent occasions on which we have reversed under the Fourteenth Amendment convictions of peaceful individuals who were convicted of breach of the peace because of the acts of hostile onlookers, we are reluctant to assume that the breach-of-peace statute covers petitioners' conduct here. . . . Since there was no evidence to support the breach-of-peace convictions, they should not stand.\" Id., at 150-151.\n\n\n I do not find this case meaningfully distinguishable from Garner and Barr. Clearly, nothing petitioners did prior to being placed under arrest could be called disorderly conduct; their only \"sins\" up to that point were being Negro or being in the company of Negroes, and politely refusing to leave the park. Nonetheless, they were arrested. Then all five members of the group briefly linked arms, and, in a further show of passive resistance, the three men dropped to the ground. They did not, the police officers testified, offer anything in the way of active resistance to either arrest or ejection. As Judge Oppenheimer observed: \"In resisting the command of the officers to leave the park, the defendants used no force against the officers or anyone else; they held back or fell to the ground.\" 236 Md., at 355, 204 A. 2d, at 68. Nor did they argue with the police, cf. Thompson v. Louisville, supra, or use profanity, cf. Sharpe v. State, 231 Md. 401. 190 A. 2d 628, cert. denied, \n375 \nU.S. 946\n; indeed, the only words spoken were in the nature of a plea for forgiveness of one of the mob. All they did was refuse to assist in their own ejection from a segregated amusement park.\n\nThe two women did not even lie down. The only bit of testimony from which the trial judge could possibly have inferred disorderly behavior is the following:\n\n \"Q. Now, Officer, do you always place handcuffs on persons whom you have arrested? \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. When I have a little trouble getting them through the Park or any - when I have a little trouble with them, yes.\n\n\n \"Q. What trouble did you have with Juretha Joyner?\n\n\n \"A. By refusing to leave.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you place handcuffs on any of the other Defendants?\n\n\n \"A. No, I don't recall.\n\n\n \"Q. Did you or did you not?\n\n\n \"A. No, sir.\n\n\n \"Q. Now, did the two female Defendants leave the Park, did they leave under their own power?\n\n\n \"A. I had to pull them through the crowd.\n\n\n \"Q. They walked out?\n\n\n \"A. They walked out, but I had to pull them through.\n\n\n \"THE COURT: Why did you have to pull them through?\n\n\n \"A. Because they didn't want to leave voluntarily.\n\n\n \"Q. They came when you pulled?\n\n\n \"A. They did, yes, sir.\"\n\n\n There is undoubtedly some truth to the officer's surmise; I am sure neither woman liked being ejected from the park solely because of her race or the race of her friend. I suspect that their reluctance also resulted in no small measure from a fear of being pulled through a shouting, spitting, kicking mob.\n\nEven if it be assumed that the arrest of petitioners was lawful,\n6\n I have great difficulty distinguishing the conduct \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n of the women, and, to a lesser extent, that of the men, from the refusals to leave segregated establishments which were before us in Garner and Barr. I cannot see how a statute outlawing \"drunkenness and disorderly conduct\"\n7\n can be said to have given petitioners fair warning, cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, \n378 \nU.S. 347\n, that the conduct (or, in the case of the women, lack of conduct) in which they engaged was criminally punishable.\n8\n I cannot, at \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n least not without argument and full consideration by the Court, join in letting stand a decision which holds that police can arrest persons who are doing nothing remotely disorderly, secure in the knowledge that if the persons refuse wholeheartedly to cooperate in their own arrest and removal to a waiting squad car, their conviction for disorderly conduct will be forthcoming.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn Hamm v. City of Rock Hill and Lupper v. Arkansas, \n379 \nU.S. 306, 308\n, we held:\n\n\"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids discrimination in places of public accommodation and removes peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis from the category of punishable activities. Although the conduct in the present cases occurred prior to enactment of the Act, the still-pending convictions are abated by its passage.\"\n\n\n The convictions in this case did not become final until today. That the amusement park is an establishment covered by 201 of the Civil Rights Act, 78 Stat. 241, 243, seems clear.\n10\n I take it, therefore, that the Court \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n does not regard petitioners' conduct as a \"peaceful attempt to be served on an equal basis.\" I cannot agree. Surely the attempt to be served was completely orderly, and, as I indicated above, I think petitioners' post-arrest conduct amounted to no more than a natural and fully understandable reaction to their arbitrary exclusion from the park.\n\nIn two recent decisions, we have, rightly in my opinion, recognized that people denied service because of their race are likely to react with less than wholehearted cooperation. Today, I fear, the Court forgets that elemental principle of human conduct, and demands, on pain of criminal penalty, the patience of Job. In Blow v. North Carolina, \n379 \nU.S. 684\n, the evidence adduced at trial showed that the petitioners, two Negroes, were refused service in a restaurant, whereupon one proceeded to sit down on the floor mat outside the door, and the other stood near the door. They were convicted under a statute making it a crime to enter upon the lands of another without a license after being forbidden to do so. We held that the Civil Rights Act abated their convictions. In McKinnie v. Tennessee, \n380 \nU.S. 449\n, the petitioners, eight Negroes, entered the vestibule of a restaurant, were refused entrance into the restaurant proper, whereupon they remained in the vestibule, which measured 6' x 6' 4\", for approximately 20 minutes. There was testimony that the petitioners had engaged in some pushing and shoving, but the evidence was unclear as to whether the pushing was initiated by the Negroes or was attributable to white people who, during the 20 minutes, entered the restaurant through the vestibule. Again, we held that the convictions (for conspiracy to injure trade or commerce) had been abated by the passage of the Civil Rights Act. In \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 430]\n\u00a0\n each case we concluded that the conduct of the petitioners constituted no more than a peaceful refusal to acquiesce in a denial of their federal rights. I think we should draw the same conclusion here.\n\nIn dissenting, I of course do not suggest that a civil rights demonstrator, or anybody else, has a right to block traffic, or bar access to a man's home or place of business. I fully concur in the Court's observation in Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 554\n-555:\n\n\"The constitutional guarantee of liberty implies the existence of an organized society maintaining public order, without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of anarchy. The control of travel on the streets is a clear example of governmental responsibility to insure this necessary order. A restriction in that relation, designed to promote the public convenience in the interest of all, and not susceptible to abuses of discriminatory application, cannot be disregarded by the attempted exercise of some civil right which, in other circumstances, would be entitled to protection. One would not be justified in ignoring the familiar red light because this was thought to be a means of social protest. Nor could one, contrary to traffic regulations, insist upon a street meeting in the middle of Times Square at the rush hour as a form of freedom of speech or assembly. Governmental authorities have the duty and responsibility to keep their streets open and available for movement. A group of demonstrators could not insist upon the right to cordon off a street, or entrance to a public or private building, and allow no one to pass who did not agree to listen to their exhortations.\"\n\n\n But such examples are a far cry from what happened here. Juretha Joyner, a Negro, went with some friends to celebrate \"All Nations Day\" at Gwynn Oak Park. Despite the facts that she behaved with complete order and dignity, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 431]\n\u00a0\n and that her right to be at the park is protected by federal law, she was asked to leave, solely because of her race. She refused and, upon being handcuffed, displayed some reluctance (though no active resistance) to being pulled through an actively hostile mob. For this she was convicted of \"acting in a disorderly manner, to the disturbance of the public peace.\" Today the Court declines to review her conviction, and the convictions of her three companions. I cannot join.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] I agree with appellee that this is not a proper appeal. However, in 28 U.S.C. 2103 (1958 ed., Supp. V), Congress has provided, in pertinent part:\n\n\"If an appeal to the Supreme Court is improvidently taken from the decision of the highest court of a State, or of a United States court of appeals, in a case where the proper mode of a review is by petition for certiorari, this alone shall not be ground for dismissal; but the papers whereon the appeal was taken shall be regarded and acted on as a petition for writ of certiorari and as if duly presented to the Supreme Court at the time the appeal was taken.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 123 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\"Drunkenness and disorderly conduct generally; habitual offenders.\n\n\n\"Every person who shall be found drunk, or acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public peace, [in any of a number of specified locations, including places of public resort or amusement] shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor; and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not more than fifty dollars, or be confined in jail for a period of not more than sixty days or be both fined and imprisoned in the discretion of the court. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This Court has never (and I hope it never does) let the fact that the criminal penalty is relatively small stand in the way of reviewing a case presenting important constitutional questions. E. g., Thompson v. Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199, 203\n-204 ($10 fine); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n ($10 fine).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 551\n-552.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In Garner the Court noted that the record did not support the allegation that the trial judge had taken judicial notice of the fact that the petitioners' presence in a segregated establishment was likely to cause a disturbance. \n368 \nU.S., at 173\n. Neither the trial transcript in the instant case nor the trial judge's memorandum opinion indicates that he took that sort of notice here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is far from clear that the arrest was lawful. In view of the fact that 24-13 of the Baltimore County Code (1958) authorizes the appointment of special police officers \"for the proper protection of persons and property in the county,\" it may well be that the guard who asked petitioners to leave the park enjoyed the same status as the officer involved in Griffin v. Maryland, \n378 \nU.S. 130\n. When this case was here the first time, we remanded it for consideration in light of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n Griffin. However, only Judge Oppenheimer, dissenting, drew from our remand the meaning that, until today, I too had thought it was supposed to carry, and voted to remand the case to the trial court for an investigation of the relation between the guard and the county:\n\n\"If wood, the `special officer' in this case, had virtually the same authority from Baltimore County that Collins [the guard involved in Griffin] had from Montgomery County . . . then under Griffin v. Maryland, supra, the State was a joint participant in the discriminatory action.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"The Baltimore County Code authorizes the county to appoint special police officers to serve for private persons or corporations. Baltimore County Code, Sections 24-13 and 35-3 (1958). I would remand this case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for the taking of additional testimony to determine whether or not Wood was appointed by Baltimore County under these sections of its Code. If he was, the convictions should be reversed.\" 236 Md., at 355; 204 A. 2d, at 68 (Oppenheimer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n Thus we still do not know whether the guard's action constituted state action, thereby rendering his command to leave the park unconstitutional. Yet it is axiomatic that \"one cannot be punished for failing to obey the command of an officer if that command is itself violative of the Constitution.\" Wright v. Georgia, \n373 \nU.S. 284, 291\n-292. Moreover, a strong argument can be made that, under Maryland law, resisting an unlawful arrest does not constitute disorderly conduct. See Sharpe v. State, 231 Md. 401, 403, 404, 190 A. 2d 628, 630, cert. denied, \n375 \nU.S. 946\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] With the conduct of petitioners herein, compare that of the defendants in Sharpe v. State, supra, note 6, and In re Cromwell, 232 Md. 409, 194 A. 2d 88. Also, compare Niemotko v. State, 194 Md. 247, 250, 71 A. 2d 9, 10, with Niemotko v. Maryland, \n340 \nU.S. 268, 271\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Whether or not petitioners' conduct would support a conviction for something other than disturbing the peace I do not know. Nor \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n do I inquire, for \"[c]onviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process.\" De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 362\n. See also Garner v. Louisiana, \n368 \nU.S. 157, 164\n; Thompson v. Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199, 206\n; Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It seems to me that the persons who were in fact guilty of disorderly conduct were the members of the crowd; however, none of them was prosecuted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] There is a restaurant at Gwynn Oak Park; indeed, petitioners were standing next to it when they were arrested. If a substantial portion of the food served in that restaurant has moved in interstate commerce, the entire amusement park is a place of public accommodation under the Act. 201 (b) (2), 201 (b) (4), 201 (c). See also 201 (b) (3). If the Court were unwilling to assume that the restaurant serves a substantial portion of such food, the proper course would be to remand the case for a hearing on the issue. Since the Court denies certiorari, I assume that it is for some other reason that it \n\n[381 \nU.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n regards petitioners' conduct as not protected by the Act. I further assume that the fact that three of the petitioners are white is not the decisive factor, cf. Walker v. Georgia, ante, p. 355, since certiorari is denied as to the Negro petitioner too.\n\n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDRUEDING v.

SIMMONS(1965)\nNo. 38\nArgued: November 17, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n In 1910 the Texas State Land Board sold some public land by contract calling for a small down payment plus annual interest and principal payments. State law provided for the termination of the contract and forfeiture of the land for nonpayment of interest, and in such case the purchaser or his vendee could reinstate his claim on written request and payment of delinquent interest, unless rights of third parties intervened. In 1941 the law was amended limiting reinstatement rights to five years from the forfeiture date. Here the land was forfeited in 1947 and appellee, who thereafter took quitclaim deeds to the land, filed for reinstatement and tendered payment more than five years later. His application was denied. The State sold the land to the City of El Paso in 1955 and appellee filed this suit to determine title thereto. The District Court granted appellant's motion for summary judgment on the basis of the 1941 statute. The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the 1941 law impaired the obligation of contracts in contravention of Art. I, 10, of the Constitution, but remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of the City's defenses of laches and adverse possession. Held:\n\n 1. Although this appeal was improperly brought under 28 U.S.C. 1254 (2), the Court treats the papers whereon the appeal was filed as a petition for certiorari under 28 U.S.C. 2103, dismisses the appeal and grants certiorari. Pp. 501-503.\n\n\n 2. It is not every modification of a contractual promise that impairs the obligation of a contract, any more than it is every alteration of existing remedies that violates the Contract Clause. The prohibition against impairment of the obligation of contract \"is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.\" Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 428\n. Pp. 506-508.\n\n\n 3. The State has reserved power to safeguard the vital interests of its people, which may modify or affect the obligation of contract but not destroy the constitutional limitation; and the reserved power and this limitation must be construed in harmony with each other. Pp. 508-509. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 4. Without affecting the central undertaking of the seller or the primary consideration for the buyer's undertaking, the Texas statute of repose serves significant state objectives: clarification of land titles, elimination of massive litigation over titles and effective utilization of property. Hence, it impairs no protected right under the Contract Clause. Pp. 509-517.\n\n\n Appeal dismissed and certiorari granted; 320 F.2d 541, reversed.\n\nWilliam J. Mounce argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief was Thornton Hardie.\n\nGreenberry Simmons, appellee, argued the cause and filed a brief pro se.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nUnder the applicable statutes existing in Texas in 1910, the year in which the contracts in this case were made, the State Land Board was authorized to sell the public lands allocated to the Permanent Free School Fund on longterm contracts calling for a down payment of one-fortieth of the principal and annual payment of interest and principal. The time for payment of principal was extended periodically and the principal was never called due. In the event of nonpayment of interest, however, the statutes authorized the termination of the contract and the forfeiture of the lands to the State without the necessity of re-entry or judicial proceedings, the land again to become a part of the public domain and to be resold for the account of the school fund.\n1\n The provision chiefly in issue in this case provided:\n\n\"In any cases where lands have been forfeited to the State for the non-payment of interest, the purchasers \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n or their vendees may have their claims reinstated on their written request, by paying into the treasury the full amount of interest due on such claim up to the date of reinstatement; provided, that no rights of third persons may have intervened. In all such cases the original obligations and penalties shall thereby become as binding as if no forfeiture had ever occurred.\" Tex. Gen. Laws 1897, ch. 129, art. 4218f.\n\n\n In 1941, the foregoing provisions were amended. Among other things, the offering of forfeited land for sale on a subsequent sale date was made permissive instead of mandatory and a provision was added stating that the right to reinstate lands forfeited thereafter \"must be exercised within five (5) years from the date of the forfeiture.\" Tex Gen. & Spec. Laws 1941, ch. 191, 3, Vernon's Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5326. In 1951, the right of reinstatement was limited to the last purchaser from the State and his vendees or heirs. Tex. Gen. & Spec. Laws 1951, ch. 59, 2, Vernon's Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5326.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1910, certain predecessors in title of Simmons, the appellee, executed their installment contracts to purchase school lands from the State of Texas. The original purchasers made a down payment of one-fortieth of the principal and made annual interest payments. The purchase contracts were assigned several times and interest payments fell into arrears during the forties. On July 21, 1947, after a notice of arrears and request for payment, the land was forfeited for nonpayment of interest. A notice of forfeiture and a copy of the 1941 Act allowing reinstatement within five years were sent to the last purchaser of record, but were returned unclaimed. Appellee Simmons, a citizen of Kentucky, thereafter took quitclaim \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n deeds to the land in question and filed his applications for reinstatement, tendering the required payments. The applications were denied because they had not been made within five years of the forfeiture as required by the 1941 statute. In 1955, pursuant to special legislation, the land was sold by the State to the City of El Paso. Simmons then filed this suit in the Federal District Court to determine title to the land in question. In its answer the City relied upon the 1941 statute as barring Simmons' claim and also pleaded adverse possession and laches as additional defenses. The District Court granted the City's motion for summary judgment on the ground of the 1941 statute.\n3\n The Court of Appeals reversed, 320 F.2d 541 (C. A. 5th Cir.), ruling that the right to reinstate was a vested contractual right and that the prohibition against impairment of contracts contained in Art. I, 10, of the Constitution of the United States prohibited the application of the 1941 statute to the contract here in question. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n377 \nU.S. 902\n. We reverse.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAlthough neither party has raised the issue, we deal at the outset with a jurisdictional matter. The appeal in this case is here under 28 U.S.C. 1254 (2) (1958 ed.).\n4\n The Court of Appeals, after holding the Texas statute \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional, remanded the case to the District Court to determine the City's defenses of laches and adverse possession. Under a prior interpretation of 240 (b) of the Judicial Code, the predecessor provision of 1254 (2), a final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals is necessary to the exercise of our jurisdiction over the case by way of appeal, Slaker v. O'Connor, \n278 \nU.S. 188\n, which was followed without comment in South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. v. Flemming, \n351 \nU.S. 901\n, and questioned but not put to rest in Chicago v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77\n, the judgment in that case being deemed a final one. These questions under 1254 (2) were neither briefed nor argued in this case and it is not appropriate to resolve them here.\n\nIn 1962 Congress expanded the scope of 28 U.S.C. 2103 to apply to appeals from the United States courts of appeals.\n5\n That section now provides that an appeal improvidently taken from a court of appeals as well as from a state court shall not be dismissed for that reason alone, but that the appeal papers shall be regarded and acted on as a petition for a writ of certiorari. The restriction in 28 U.S.C. 1254 (2) (1958 ed.) providing that an appeal from the court of appeals \"shall preclude review by writ of certiorari at the instance of such appellant\" is no bar to our treating this case as here on a \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n petition for certiorari. For this provision means only that if an appeal is proper and has been taken, certiorari will not thereafter be available; where the appeal is not proper, this Court will still consider a timely application for certiorari.\n6\n Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n284 \nU.S. 221\n. No timely application for certiorari has been filed in the instant case. But 28 U.S.C. 2103 (1958 ed., Supp. V) now requires that we treat the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for certiorari. Accordingly we dismiss the appeal and grant the writ of certiorari.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the merits. The City seeks to bring this case within the long line of cases recognizing a distinction between contract obligation and remedy and permitting a modification of the remedy as long as there is no substantial impairment of the value of the obligation. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 200; Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 553-554; Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n. More specifically, it invokes three cases in this Court, two from Texas, that held it constitutionally permissible to apply state statutes allowing forfeiture of land purchase rights to land contracts between private persons and the State made when the law did not provide for forfeiture or permitted it only upon \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n court order. Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399\n; Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 \nU.S. 595\n; Aikins v. Kingsbury, \n247 \nU.S. 484\n.\n7\n In those cases the Court reasoned that the state statutes existing when the contracts were made were not to be considered the exclusive remedies available in the event of the purchaser's default since there was no promise, express or implied, on the part of the State not to enlarge the remedy or grant another in case of breach.\n\nThe Court of Appeals rejected the City's contention. The Texas cases, according to the Court of Appeals, hold \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n that the reinstatement provision confers a vested right which is not subject to legislative alteration.\n8\n From this it concluded that under state law the five-year limitation on reinstatement was not a mere modification of remedy \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n but a change in the obligation of a contract. Relying on the theory that it is state law that determines the obligations of the parties, the Court of Appeals found that the 1941 statute abrogated an obligation of the contract and thus violated the Contract Clause of the Constitution.\n\nWe do not pause to consider further whether the Court of Appeals correctly ascertained the Texas law at the time these contracts were made, or to chart again the dividing line under federal law between \"remedy\" and \"obligation,\" or to determine the extent to which this line is controlled by state court decisions, decisions often rendered in contexts not involving Contract Clause considerations.\n9\n For it is not every modification of a contractual \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n promise that impairs the obligation of contract under federal law, any more than it is every alteration of existing remedies that violates the Contract Clause. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n; Stone v. Mississippi, \n101 \nU.S. 814, 819\n; Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473\n. Assuming the provision for reinstatement after default to be part of the State's obligation, we do not think its modification by a five-year statute of repose contravenes the Contract Clause.\n\nThe decisions \"put it beyond question that the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula,\" as Chief Justice Hughes said in Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 428\n. The Blaisdell opinion, which amounted to a comprehensive restatement of the principles underlying the application of the Contract Clause, makes it quite clear that \"[n]to only is the constitutional provision qualified by the measure of control which the State retains over remedial processes, but the State also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end `has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect.' Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n. Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order. . . . This principle of harmonizing the constitutional prohibition with the necessary residuum of state power has had progressive recognition in the decisions of this Court.\" \n290 \nU.S., at 434\n-435. Moreover, the \"economic interests of the State may justify the exercise of its continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts.\" Id., at 437. The State has the \"sovereign right . . . to protect the . . . general welfare of the people . . . . Once we are in this domain of the reserve power of a State we must respect the `wide discretion on the part of the legislature in determining what is and \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 509]\n\u00a0\n what is not necessary.'\" East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn, \n326 \nU.S. 230, 232\n-233. As Mr. Justice Johnson said in Ogden v. Saunders, \"[i]t is the motive, the policy, the object, that must characterize the legislative act, to affect it with the imputation of violating the obligation of contracts.\" 12 Wheat. 213, 291.\n\nOf course, the power of a State to modify or affect the obligation of contract is not without limit. \"[W]hatever is reserved of state power must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power. The reserved power cannot be construed so as to destroy the limitation, nor is the limitation to be construed to destroy the reserved power in its essential aspects. They must be construed in harmony with each other. This principle precludes a construction which would permit the State to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them.\" Blaisdell, supra, at 439. But we think the objects of the Texas statute make abundantly clear that it impairs no protected right under the Contract Clause.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nTexas, upon entering the Union, reserved its entire public domain, one-half of which was set aside under the 1876 Constitution to finance a universal system of free public education.\n10\n These lands, over 42,000,000 acres, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 510]\n\u00a0\n were to be sold as quickly as practicable in order to provide revenues for the public school system and to encourage the settlement of the vast public domain. The terms of sale were undemanding and designed to accomplish the widespread sale and development of the public domain. The State required a down payment of one-fortieth of the purchase price, an annual payment of one-fortieth of principal and an annual payment of interest.\n11\n The terms were frequently modified in favor of purchasers. Periodically, during the course of almost a century, the time for payment of the nominal principal amount was extended.\n12\n In 1919, the requirement that the purchaser settle on the land or adjoining land was lifted,\n13\n provisions allowing forfeiting purchasers a first opportunity to repurchase forfeited land at a newly appraised \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 511]\n\u00a0\n value were thrice added,\n14\n interest in arrears was forgiven under one of these acts,\n15\n and reclassification of lands was held not to deprive forfeiting purchasers, upon reinstatement, of their mineral rights in the land.\n16\n But eventually the evolution of a frontier society to a modern State, attended by the discovery of oil and gas deposits which led to speculation and exploitation of the changes in the use and value of the lands, called forth amendments to the Texas land laws modifying the conditions of sale in favor of the State. Beside increasing the required down payment from one-fortieth to one-fifth of the purchase price,\n17\n the State restricted the right of reinstatement to the last purchaser from the State or his assigns and required that this right be exercised within five years from the date of forfeiture.\n\nThe circumstances behind the 1941 amendment are well described in the Reports of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The general purpose of the legislation enacted in 1941 was to restore confidence in the stability and integrity of land titles and to enable the State to protect and administer its property in a \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 512]\n\u00a0\n businesslike manner. 1938-1940 Rep. 5. \"[T]he records [of the land office] show that through the years many thousands of purchase contracts, covering, in the aggregate, millions of acres of school land, have been forfeited by failure of the purchasers to meet the small annual interest payments requisite to the maintenance of the contracts.\" Id., at 11-12. In 1939, 15,000 sales contracts were found delinquent and subject to forfeiture and there were about 600,000 acres of unsold surveyed school lands, the major portion of which had produced no revenue for a decade. Ibid. This state of affairs was principally attributable to the opportunity for speculation to which unlimited reinstatement rights gave rise. Forfeited purchase contracts which had remained dormant for years could be reinstated if and when the land became potentially productive of gas and oil. Where forfeited lands were purchased without reservation of minerals to the State, as was the case in respect to early purchases before discovery of the extensive mineral wealth in the State, all of the mineral rights reverted to the owner of the reinstated claims, regardless of the State's later attempts in forfeited sales to share in the mineral interest. Gulf Production Co. v. State, 231 S. W. 124 (Tex. Civ. App.). Hence the Land Commissioner noted that the majority of sales and resales under the laws requiring sale to the highest bidder\n18\n were to purchasers buying a \"speculative option,\" \"taken for possible profits on the rights of the surface owners to lease the land for oil and gas.\" \"Under such conditions lands were bid in at highly inflated prices such as no one who expected to keep the land could afford to offer.\" 1940-1942 Rep. 5. The attempts to assure some stability in land sales through \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 513]\n\u00a0\n repurchase acts, allowing delinquent owners a preferential right to buy forfeited land at a reappraised value, and, under one act, without payment of accumulated interest in arrears, proved unsuccessful, and expensive. In regard to one of the State's attempts to quiet titles through a repurchase act, the Land Commissioner in 1925 expressed the belief that the \"owners can realize such returns from [the lands] as will enable them to pay interest thereon instead of continuing the recurring annual forfeiture and resale and so on indefinitely.\" 1924-1926 Rep. 5. In 1939, a new Commissioner noted that 1,872,326 acres had been forfeited and 1,195,993 acres repurchased under the three repurchase acts. The net loss to the School Fund from repurchases was said to be $1,661,980 plus the loss in interest arrears of $418,000. 1938-1940 Rep. 12.\n\nNo less significant was the imbroglio over land titles in Texas. The long shadow cast by perpetual reinstatement gave rise to a spate of litigation between forfeiting purchasers and the State or between one or more forfeiting purchasers and other forfeiting purchasers. See, e. g., Weaver v. Robison, 114 Tex. 272, 268 S. W. 133; Anderson v. Neighbors, 94 Tex. 236, 59 S. W. 543; Mound Oil Co. v. Terrell, 99 Tex. 625, 92 S. W. 451. Where the same land had been sold and contracts forfeited several times, as was frequently the case, the right to reinstate could be exercised by any one of the forfeiting purchasers or his vendees. Hoefer v. Robison, 104 Tex. 159, 135 S. W. 371. Cf. Faulkner v. Lear, 258 S. W. 2d 147 (Tex. Civ. App.). It was this situation to which the Texas Legislature addressed itself in 1941 and it is in light of this situation that we judge the validity of the amendment.\n\nThe Contract Clause of the Constitution does not render Texas powerless to take effective and necessary \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 514]\n\u00a0\n measures to deal with the above. We note at the outset that the promise of reinstatement, whether deemed remedial or substantive, was not the central undertaking of the seller nor the primary consideration for the buyer's undertaking. See Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399\n; Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 \nU.S. 595\n; Aikins v. Kingsbury, \n247 \nU.S. 484\n. Under this agreement the State promised to transfer title to the buyer upon his payment of the purchase price; in turn the buyer was obliged to make a nominal down payment of one-fortieth of the purchase price and to maintain annual interest payments. Where the buyer breached what was practically his only obligation under the contract, the land reverted back to the school fund, Boykin v. Southwest Texas Oil & Gas Co., 256 S. W. 581, and a right of reinstatement arose, conditioned on the State's refusal or failure to dispose of the land by sale or lease. Hoefer v. Robison, 104 Tex. 159, 135 S. W. 371. We do not believe that it can seriously be contended that the buyer was substantially induced to enter into these contracts on the basis of a defeasible right to reinstatement in case of his failure to perform, or that he interpreted that right to be of everlasting effect. At the time the contract was entered into the State's policy was to sell the land as quickly as possible, and the State took many steps to induce sales. See Becton v. Dublin, 163 S. W. 2d 907, 910 (Tex. Civ. App.). Thus, for example, the Land Commissioner was required to reclassify forfeited lands by the next sale day and to publicize widely the forfeiture and sale. Weaver v. Robison, 114 Tex. 272, 268 S. W. 133. This policy clearly indicates that the right of reinstatement was not conceived to be an endless privilege conferred on a defaulting buyer. A contrary construction would render the buyer's obligations under the contract quite illusory while obliging the State to transfer the land whenever the purchaser decided to comply with the contract, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n all this for a nominal down payment. We, like the Court in Faitoute Iron & Steel Co. v. City of Asbury Park, \n316 \nU.S. 502, 514\n, believe that \"[t]he Constitution is `intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories.' Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451, 457\n.\"\n\nThe State's policy of quick resale of forfeited lands did not prove entirely successful; forfeiting purchasers who repurchased the lands again defaulted and other purchasers bought without any intention of complying with their contracts unless mineral wealth was discovered. The market for land contracted during the depression. 1938-1940 Rep. 12. These developments hardly to be expected or foreseen, operated to confer considerable advantages on the purchaser and his successors and a costly and difficult burden on the State. This Court's decisions have never given a law which imposes unforeseen advantages or burdens on a contracting party constitutional immunity against change. Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n; Gelfert v. National City Bank, \n313 \nU.S. 221\n; East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn, \n326 \nU.S. 230\n. Laws which restrict a party to those gains reasonably to be expected from the contract are not subject to attack under the Contract Clause, notwithstanding that they technically alter an obligation of a contract. The five-year limitation allows defaulting purchasers with a bona fide interest in their lands a reasonable time to reinstate. It does not and need not allow defaulting purchasers with a speculative interest in the discovery of minerals to remain in endless default while retaining a cloud on title.\n\nThe clouds on title arising from reinstatement rights were not without significance to the State's vital interest in administering its school lands to produce maximum revenue and in utilizing its properties in ways best suited to the needs of a growing population. The uncertainty \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n of land titles, the massive litigation to which this gave rise, and the pattern of sale and forfeiture were quite costly to the school fund and to the development of land use. Timeless reinstatement rights prevented the State from maintaining an orderly system of land sales and the resultant confusion impeded the effective disposition of lands and utilization of mineral wealth within them. Where sales by the State were not feasible or desirable, the State was prevented from utilizing the lands or permitting its subdivisions to utilize them by the possibility that some one of several purchasers might at some unknowable future date assert the right to reinstatement. In this very case, the legislature authorized by special act the transfer of this land to the City of El Paso, reserving the minerals to the State, in recognition of \"[t]he fact that the City of El Paso is in urgent need of expanding its sources of water and of protecting water wells previously drilled,\" Tex. Gen. & Spec. Laws 1955, ch. 278. This transfer would have been invalid absent the 1941 Act.\n\nThe program adopted at the turn of the century for the sale, settlement, forfeiture, and reinstatement of land was not wholly effectual to serve the objectives of the State's land program many decades later. Settlement was no longer the objective, but revenues for the school fund, efficient utilization of public lands, and compliance with contracts of sale remained viable and important goals, as did the policy of relieving purchasers from the hardships of temporary adversity. Given these objectives and the impediments posed to their fulfillment by timeless reinstatement rights, a statute of repose was quite clearly necessary. The measure taken to induce defaulting purchasers to comply with their contracts, requiring payment of interest in arrears within five years, was a mild one indeed, hardly burdensome to the purchaser \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 517]\n\u00a0\n who wanted to adhere to his contract of purchase, but nonetheless an important one to the State's interest. The Contract Clause does not forbid such a measure.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of 1895 provided in pertinent part:\n\n\"Sec. 11. If upon the first day of November of any year the interest due on any obligation remains unpaid, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall endorse on such obligation `Land Forfeited,' and shall cause an entry to that effect to be made on the account kept with the purchaser, and thereupon said land shall \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n thereby be forfeited to the State without the necessity of re-entry or judicial ascertainment, and shall revert to the particular fund to which it originally belonged, and be resold under the provisions of this act or any future law: . . . Provided, further, that nothing in this section contained shall be construed to inhibit the State from instituting such legal proceedings as may be necessary to enforce such forfeiture, or to recover the full amount of the interest and such penalties as may be due the State at the time such forfeiture occurred, or to protect any other right to such land, which suits may be instituted by the Attorney General or under his direction, in the proper court of the county in which the land lies or of the county to which such county is attached for judicial purposes: Provided, this section shall be printed on the back of receipt.\" Tex. Gen. Laws 1895, ch. 47.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Art. 5326 now reads:\n\n\"If any portion of the interest on any sale should not be paid when due, the land shall be subject to forfeiture by the Commissioner entering on the wrapper containing the papers `Land Forfeited,' or \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n words of similar import, with the date of such action and sign it officially, and thereupon the land and all payments shall be forfeited to the State, and the lands may be offered for sale on a subsequent sale date. In any case where lands have heretofore been forfeited or may hereafter be forfeited to the State for non-payment of interest, the purchasers, or their vendees, heirs or legal representatives, may have their claims re-instated on their written request by paying into the Treasury the full amount of interest due on such claim up to the date of re-instatement, provided that no rights of third persons may have intervened. The right to re-instate shall be limited to the last purchaser from the State or his vendees or their heirs or legal representatives. Such right must be exercised within five (5) years from the date of the forfeiture. . . . In all cases the original obligations and penalties shall thereby become as binding as if no forfeiture had ever occurred. If any purchaser shall die, his heirs or legal representatives shall have one (1) year in which to make payment after the first day of November next after such death, before the Commissioner shall forfeit the land belonging to such deceased purchaser; and should such forfeiture be made by the Commissioner within said time, upon proper proof of such death being made, such forfeiture shall be set aside, provided that no rights of third persons may have intervened. Nothing in this Article shall inhibit the State from instituting such legal proceedings as may be necessary to enforce such forfeiture, or to recover the full amount of the interest and such penalties as may be due the State at the time such forfeiture occurred, or to protect any other right to such land.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The District Court's judgment does not explicitly refer to the 1941 statute, but the Court of Appeals interpreted that Act to be the basis of the judgment. We accept this interpretation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by the following methods: . . .\n\n\"(2) By appeal by a party relying on a State statute held by a court of appeals to be invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, but such appeal shall preclude review by writ of certiorari at the instance of such appellant, and the review on appeal shall be restricted to the Federal questions presented . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 28 U.S.C. 2103 (1958 ed., Supp. V) reads:\n\n\"If an appeal to the Supreme Court is improvidently taken from the decision of the highest court of a State, or of a United States court of appeals, in a case where the proper mode of a review is by petition for certiorari, this alone shall not be ground for dismissal; but the papers whereon the appeal was taken shall be regarded and acted on as a petition for writ of certiorari and as if duly presented to the Supreme Court at the time the appeal was taken. Where in such a case there appears to be no reasonable ground for granting a petition for writ of certiorari it shall be competent for the Supreme Court to adjudge to the respondent reasonable damages for his delay, and single or double costs.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The predecessor of 1254 (1), 240 (a) of the Act of February 13, 1925 (the Judges Act), was amended on the floor of the Senate to state that review by certiorari from the courts of appeals would carry the same scope of review \"as if the cause had been brought there by unrestricted writ of error or appeal.\" The word \"unrestricted\" was added immediately before 240 (b) (now 1254 (2)) was introduced, and the sponsor of both amendments, Senator Cummins, explained that review by appeal as provided in that section would be limited \"to the Federal question, and that it ought not to extend to the entire controversy that may be in the case,\" as he envisaged would be the case with certiorari review. See 66 Cong. Rec. 2919 (remarks of Senator Cummins).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399\n, Texas sold land pursuant to the Act of 1879, which made it the duty of the State in case of default to proceed to enforce its rights by court action. The Texas courts allowed the State to proceed with forfeiture under the 1897 statute providing for forfeiture by endorsement on official documents rather than by court decree. Neither the Texas courts nor this Court read the 1879 statute as providing an exclusive remedy or as a promise by the State not to modify the remedy or provide another one in the event of default. Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 \nU.S. 595\n, involved a contract for the sale of state school lands at a time when the existing statutes gave the State no remedy at all upon default in annual payments. This Court found no violation of the Contract Clause in the state proceeding to declare a forfeiture under the 1897 statute. Here again \"[t]here was no promise or contract expressed in the statute that the State would not enlarge the remedy or grant another on account of the purchaser's violation of his contract, and we think no such contract is to be implied.\" \n188 \nU.S., at 603\n. The principle of Wilson v. Standefer was held controlling, the Court seeing no difference in principle between the case where the State altered an existing remedy after the contract was entered into and the case where the State supplied the remedy where none existed when the contract was made. The third case came here from the California courts, Aikins v. Kingsbury, \n247 \nU.S. 484\n. There the Court found no violation of the Contract Clause in the state proceeding declaring a forfeiture by nonjudicial action as permitted by a statute passed after the contract was made, the prior law requiring the State to proceed with judicial action with a right in the purchaser to redeem within 20 days after decree. Wilson and Waggoner were considered controlling authority.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The state cases on this issue are unclear. In Fristoe v. Blum, 92 Tex. 76, 45 S. W. 998, the Texas Supreme Court held that the 1887 Act providing for forfeiture upon default in making payment of \"any obligation\" applied to contracts made before as well as after the enactment of the Act. Such a construction was not deemed to impair the obligation of contract, for the State had by common law the right as vendor, upon the purchaser's failure to perform his part of the contract, a right to rescind the contract of sale and resume control of the land. The statute giving the Commissioner authority to declare a forfeiture merely supplied a more effective way of enforcing the State's common-law right of rescission.\n\nIn regard to the right of reinstatement, Anderson v. Neighbors, 94 Tex. 236, 59 S. W. 543, and Davis v. Yates, 63 Tex. Civ. App. 6, 133 S. W. 281, held that intervening third-party rights must be so far perfected as to be vested in order to defeat reinstatement rights. Cruzan v. Walker, 119 Tex. 189, 26 S. W. 2d 908, and Freels v. Walker, 120 Tex. 291, 26 S. W. 2d 627, are of similar import. Hooks v. Kirby, 58 Tex. Civ. App. 335, 124 S. W. 156, dealt with the right of the purchaser of timber to purchase the land itself; it did not deal with reinstatement under the section here involved. Gulf Production Co. v. State, 231 S. W. 124 (Tex. Civ. App.), the principal support for the Court of Appeals decision, held that the legislature had not intended to defeat the right to reinstatement by reclassifying the land as mineral land, the sale of which then involved retention of mineral rights by the State. The Court in Gulf did indicate that it considered the right to reinstatement a vested right with which the State could not arbitrarily interfere. But it was not faced with a statute which actually attempted to modify this right, much less one which put a reasonable time limit upon that right. In Faulkner v. Lear, 258 S. W. 2d 147 (Tex. Civ. App.), a case involving a forfeiture under the 1941 statute, the Texas court said that the land contract, which was made prior to 1941, \"could have been reinstated only in compliance with the statute . . . as amended in 1941.\" Id., at 149. No constitutional or state law difficulties were noted.\n\nIn addition to the State's common-law right of rescission, Fristoe v. Blum, supra, the forfeiture statute states that nothing in the forfeiture provision \"shall be construed to inhibit the State from instituting \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n such legal proceedings as may be necessary to enforce such forfeiture, or to recover the full amount of the interest and such penalties as may be due the State at the time such forfeiture occurred, or to protect any other right to such land.\" Tex. Gen. Laws 1895, ch. 47, 11. This statutory language seems sufficiently broad to preserve, with notice to purchasers, the common-law right of rescission, which, unlike statutory forfeiture, was not subject to reinstatement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The provisions dealing with forfeiture, which is one of the State's remedies in case of breach, and reinstatement, which is the purchaser's remedy to cure his breach, both operate on the rights of a party after breach and thus concern the enforcement of the contract. In this sense they are remedial and the statute of repose challenged here is an alteration of remedy rather than obligation.\n\nBut decisions dating from Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, have not placed critical reliance on the distinction between obligation and remedy. At issue in Blaisdell was a statute enlarging the mortgagor's right by extending the time of redemption, a measure that the state court characterized as an impairment of the obligation of the mortgage contract. Id., at 420. Thus the question before this Court was whether this impairment contravened the contract clause. The Court in Blaisdell stated that \"`Nothing can be more material to the obligation than the means of enforcement. . . . The ideas of validity and remedy are inseparable, and both are parts of the obligation, which is guaranteed by the Constitution.'\" \n290 \nU.S., at 430\n. While noting that a State's control over remedial processes is one justification for modification of the obligation of contract, id., at 430-431, the Court \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n went on to note that the State possessed authority \"to safeguard the vital interests of its people,\" id., at 434, and its \"economic interests,\" id., at 437. \"It does not matter that legislation appropriate to that end `has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect.' Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n.\" Id., at 434-435. Further the Court stressed that validity does not turn on whether the legislation \"affects contracts incidentally, or directly or indirectly, but whether the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end.\" Id., at 438.\n\nIn Veix v. Sixth Ward Building & Loan Association of Newark, \n310 \nU.S. 32\n, the Court upheld a state statute which restricted the contractual rights of investors in a building and loan association to withdraw and recover by suit the amount of their investment. No attempt was made to classify the measure as remedial. Rather the Court noted that the contract was with a financial institution of major importance to the credit system of the State and held that the \"obligation of the Association to respond to an application for withdrawal was subject to the paramount police power.\" Id., at 38. In upholding a statute disallowing a deficiency judgment where the value of the property bought by the mortgagee at a foreclosure sale equals the amount of the debt and interest in Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n, the Court found the fact that the provision confined the creditor to securing a fair satisfaction of his debt determinative, notwithstanding that under the law in force when the contract was made the creditor could have recovered the difference between the price at the foreclosure sale and the amount of indebtedness. This holding was reaffirmed by a unanimous Court in Gelfert v. National City Bank, \n313 \nU.S. 221\n, again without any regard to whether the measure was substantive or remedial. The Court held that the mortgagee's right under prior law to the advantages of a forced sale was not entitled to constitutional protection under the contract clause. Id., at 234. Similarly in East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn, \n326 \nU.S. 230\n, no notice was taken of the remedy-obligation distinction. Rather the Court upheld a moratory statute in postdepression times suspending for the tenth year in succession the mortgagee's right of foreclosure on the ground that contracts are not constitutionally immune from impairment by state measures designed \"to safeguard the vital interests of its people.\" Id., at 232.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Texas Constitution, art. 7, 2; Tex.

JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nI have previously had a number of occasions to dissent from judgments of this Court balancing away the First Amendment's unequivocally guaranteed rights of free speech, press, assembly and petition.\n1\n In this case I am compelled to dissent from the Court's balancing away the plain guarantee of Art. I, 10, that\n\n\"No State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . .,\"\n\n\n a balancing which results in the State of Texas' taking a man's private property for public use without compensation in violation of the equally plain guarantee of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, that\n\n \". . . private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\"\n\n\n The respondent, Simmons, is the loser and the treasury of the State of Texas the ultimate beneficiary of the Court's action. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn 1910 Texas obligated itself by contract to sell the land here involved, the purchasers to pay one-fortieth of the price in cash, the balance due at unnamed dates, with annual interest at 3% of the unpaid balance to be paid each succeeding year. The contracts of sale approved on behalf of the State by the Texas Land Commissioner provided that the land was sold \"in accordance with the provisions of\" two Texas statutes.\n2\n The provisions of these statutes relating to the sale were thus incorporated in and became a part of the obligation assumed by Texas and the purchasers, just as if they had been spelled out word for word in the contracts. One of these incorporated statutes provided that upon failure to pay any interest due, a purchaser's rights under his contract should be \"forfeited to the State,\" but that even after such forfeiture the purchaser could have his claim under the original contract\n\n\"re-instated on . . . written request by paying into the Treasury the full amount of interest due on such claim up to the date of re-instatement, provided that no rights of third persons may have intervened.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n Some 37 years after execution of the contracts involved in this case, interest payments fell into arrears and the State declared the contracts forfeited. Five years and two days later Simmons, having become the owner of the contracts by valid sale and assignment, tendered payment of all interest due\n4\n and asked the State to carry out its \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 519]\n\u00a0\n contractual obligation to reinstate his claim to the land. Since the State still owned the land and admittedly no rights of third persons had intervened, Simmons was unquestionably entitled to reinstatement of his claim under the terms of the State's original obligation. The State nevertheless refused to honor its contracts providing for reinstatement on tender of interest, and several years later sold the land, less mineral rights, to the City of El Paso for a price much higher than it would have received by honoring the contract and selling to Simmons at the contract price.\n5\n Simmons brought an action in federal court to establish his title. The Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, held that the Contract Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 10, prevented Texas from thus repudiating the obligation it had assumed in its 1910 contracts.\n\nThis Court now reverses the Court of Appeals and holds that Texas was justified in dishonoring its contractual obligation because of a state law passed in 1941 which attempted to change the obligation of this contract and the many others like it from one unconditionally allowing reinstatement, provided no rights of third parties had intervened, to one which cast off that right unless \"exercised within five (5) years from the date of the forfeiture.\"\n6\n The Court says that the State, after making a contractual obligation voluntarily and eagerly when the property was a drug on the market, was nevertheless free to enact the 1941 statute which not only impaired but flatly repudiated its former obligation after the land had greatly increased in value. And strange as \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 520]\n\u00a0\n it sounds, one of the reasons the Court gives as justification for Texas' repudiation of its obligation to Simmons and many others is that these contracts had turned out to be a bad bargain and Texas had lost millions of dollars by honoring them in the past. If the hope and realization of profit to a contract breaker are hereafter to be given either partial or sufficient weight to cancel out the unequivocal constitutional command against impairing the obligations of contracts, that command will be nullified by what is the most common cause for breaking contracts. I cannot subscribe to such a devitalizing constitutional doctrine.\n\nThe Court does not deny that under Texas law the State's contractual promise to permit reinstatement gave the purchaser a right which the State under its law was bound by the contract to honor.\n7\n The Court carefully \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 521]\n\u00a0\n does not deny that this promise by Texas is the kind of \"obligation\" which the Contract Clause was written to protect. The Court does not, unless by a most oblique reference in its footnote 9, nor could it in my judgment, allow Texas to escape its obligation by treating this as a mere change in court remedies for enforcement. Instead of relying on such grounds, the Court says that since the State acts out of what this Court thinks are good motives, and has not repudiated its contract except in a way which this Court thinks is \"reasonable,\" therefore the State will be allowed to ignore the Contract Clause of the Constitution. There follow citation of one or two dicta from past cases and a bit of skillful \"balancing,\" and the Court arrives at its conclusion: although the obligation of the contract has been impaired here, this impairment does not seem to the Court to be very serious or evil, and so therefore \"The Contract Clause does not forbid such a measure.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn its opinion the Court's discussion of the Contract Clause and this Court's past decisions applying it is brief. For the most part the Court instead discusses the difficulties and regret which the Government of Texas has experienced on account of the contracts it entered. I therefore think that the first thing it is important to point out is that there is no support whatever in history or in \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 522]\n\u00a0\n this Court's prior holdings for the decision reached in this case. Indeed, I believe that the relevant precedents all point the opposite way.\n\nThe Contract Clause was included in the same section of the Constitution which forbids States to pass bills of attainder or ex post facto laws. All three of these provisions reflect the strong belief of the Framers of the Constitution that men should not have to act at their peril, fearing always that the State might change its mind and alter the legal consequences of their past acts so as to take away their lives, their liberty or their property. James Madison explained that the people were \"weary of the fluctuating policy\" of state legislatures and wanted it made clear that under the new Government men could safely rely on States to keep faith with those who justifiably relied on their promises. The Federalist, No. 44, at 301 (Cooke ed. 1961).\n\nThe first great case construing the Contract Clause involved, much like the present case, an attempt by a State to relieve itself of the duty of honoring land grants which it regretted having made. In Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, decided in 1810, this Court speaking through Chief Justice John Marshall held that a law of the State of Georgia which attempted to terminate grants of land made by the State under authority of a prior state law was invalid as a violation of the Contract Clause.\n8\n Later in Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, decided in 1819, Chief Justice Marshall again speaking for the Court went on to say that \"Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the nation shall direct,\"\n9\n thus drawing a distinction between state action deemed to \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 523]\n\u00a0\n be a mere change of remedy, that is, the method for enforcing the contract, and state impairment of a contractual obligation.\n10\n As to the latter he emphasized that a thing promised to be done by a party to a contract is\n\n\"of course, the obligation of his contract. . . . Any law which releases a part of this obligation, must, in the literal sense of the word, impair it. . . .\n\n\n \"The words of the constitution, then, are express, and incapable of being misunderstood.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n On other occasions this Court held that the Contract Clause prohibits a State from repudiating a tax exemption included by the State in a grant of land. Gordon v. Appeal Tax Court, 3 How. 133; New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch 164.\n\nThe Court does not purport to overrule any of these past cases, but I think unless overruled they require a holding that the Texas statute violates the Contract Clause. It is therefore at least a little surprising that the Court does not find it necessary to discuss them. Instead the Court quotes a few abstract statements from some other cases, hardly a solid and persuasive basis for devitalizing one of the few provisions which the Framers deemed of sufficient importance to place in the original Constitution along with companion clauses forbidding States to pass bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.\n\nThe cases the Court mentions do not support its reasoning. Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, which the Court seems to think practically read the Contract Clause out of the Constitution, actually did \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 524]\n\u00a0\n no such thing, as the Blaisdell opinion read in its entirety shows and as subsequent decisions of this Court were careful to point out. Blaisdell without resort to \"balancing\" simply held that a State could constitutionally pass a law extending the period of redemption of a mortgage for two years where it provided for compensation to the mortgagee for the resulting delay in enforcement. In so holding the Blaisdell Court relied on and approved the established distinction between an invalid impairment of a contract's obligation and a valid change in the remedy to enforce it.\n12\n Viewed this way the Court \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 525]\n\u00a0\n in Blaisdell found no contractual promise or \"obligation\" by the State to keep the old law as to remedy static. It could and did treat the challenged state law as a general one which did no more than change the remedy to enforce contracts, a change which had carefully provided that parties entitled under the old law to foreclose mortgages should during those two years be paid the fair rental value of the property just as if the foreclosure had taken place. In so holding the Court recognized that contracts are subject to the right of partial or total eminent domain, West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507, so long as compensation is paid, and it held that since there was provision that the mortgagees would be paid the Contract Clause would permit such \"limited and temporary interpositions\"\n13\n designed to give \"temporary relief\"\n14\n through a \"temporary and conditional restraint\" on the remedy.\n15\n The Court noted that the mortgage contract was one between private persons rather than one between a private person and the State itself, and relied on past decisions which had held that \"One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the State by making a contract about them.\" Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n. See also, e. g., Dillingham v. McLaughlin, \n264 \nU.S. 370, 374\n; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 526]\n\u00a0\n \n256 \nU.S. 170, 198\n; Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n. The Contract Clause, said the Court in Blaisdell, would not be construed to \"permit the State to adopt as its policy the repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the denial of means to enforce them.\" \n290 \nU.S., at 439\n. That, the Court held, would impair the contract instead of merely delaying enforcement while compensating the creditor for the delay. No such thing can be said about this Texas law, as the Court implicitly recognizes by placing no reliance upon the distinction between the obligation and the remedy, preferring instead its \"balancing\" technique.\n16\n Chief Justice Hughes, the author of Blaisdell, later reiterated and emphasized that that case had upheld only a temporary restraint which provided for compensation, when four months later he spoke for the Court in striking down a law which did not. W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, \n292 \nU.S. 426\n. Other state laws which did not meet the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 527]\n\u00a0\n constitutional standard applied in Blaisdell were subsequently struck down. See, e. g., W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56\n; Treigle v. Acme Homestead Assn., \n297 \nU.S. 189\n; Wood v. Lovett, \n313 \nU.S. 362\n.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nNone of the other cases which the Court quotes or mentions in passing altered in any way the rule established in Fletcher v. Peck, supra, and adhered to in Blaisdell and thereafter, that a State may not pass a law repudiating contractual obligations without compensating the injured parties.\n18\n Especially should this be true when, as in the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 528]\n\u00a0\n case before us, the contractual obligation repudiated is the State's own. Compare Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, with Norman v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nTo subvert the protection of the Contract Clause here, as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments' prohibition against taking private property for public use without just compensation,\n19\n the Court has, as I said, imported into this constitutional field what I believe to be a constitutionally insupportable due process \"balancing\" technique to which I have objected in cases arising under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\n20\n and which has done so much to water down the safeguards of First Amendment freedoms. See note 1, supra. The Court says, \"Laws which restrict a party to those gains reasonably to be expected from the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 529]\n\u00a0\n contract are not subject to attack under the Contract Clause, notwithstanding that they technically alter an obligation of a contract.\" Otherwise stated, a person can make a good deal with a State but if it turns out to be a very good deal for him or a very bad deal for the State, the State is free to renege at any time. And whether gains can \"reasonably be expected from the contract\" is of course, in the Court's view, for this Court to decide. Thus this Court's judgment as to \"reasonableness\" of a law impairing or even repudiating a valid contract becomes the measure of the Contract Clause's protection.\n\nThe Court in its due process \"reasonableness\" formula, true to the principle of that indefinable standard, weighs what it considers to be the advantages and disadvantages to Texas of enforcing the contract provision, against the advantages and disadvantages to the purchasers. The Court then concludes that in its judgment the scales tip on the side of Texas and therefore refuses to give full faith to the constitutional provision. On the side of the purchasers the Court finds nothing that weighs much: the promise to reinstate was not \"central\" or \"primary\"; the contracts as viewed today seem to have been very generous to the buyers; buyers were probably not substantially induced to enter into these contracts by the \"defeasible right to reinstatement.\" The Court tries to downgrade the importance of the reinstatement obligation in the contract by volunteering the opinion that this obligation \"was not the central undertaking of the seller [Texas] nor the primary consideration for the buyer's undertaking.\" Why the Court guesses this we are not told. My guess is different. This particular provision was bound, I think, to have been a great inducement to prospective purchasers of lots and blocks of land that the State of Texas was understandably eager to sell for many reasons. It took purchasers to build up the population of Texas and thereby improve \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 530]\n\u00a0\n its business and increase its land values. It is not surprising, therefore, that the State was willing to sell its oversupply of land on liberal terms, nor should it be surprising to suggest that Texas knew that its land could be sold for more, and more quickly, by promising purchasers that so long as Texas kept the property the right of these first purchasers and their assigns to buy at the original prices should never be forfeited. To my way of thinking it demonstrates a striking lack of knowledge of credit buying and selling even to imply that these express contractual provisions safeguarding credit purchasers against forfeitures were not one of the greatest, if not the greatest, selling arguments Texas had to promote purchase of its great surfeit of lands. The Court's factual inference is all the more puzzling since its opinion emphasizes that many people entered these contracts for speculative purposes which without the redemption provision would not have been nearly so attractive.\n\nThe Court observes that it believes \"[t]he Constitution is `intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories.'\"\n21\n Of course I agree with that. But while deprivation of Simmons' right to have Texas carry out its obligation to permit him to reinstate his claim and purchase the land may seem no more than a \"theory\" to the Court, it very likely seems more than that to Texas, which by repudiating its contract has undoubtedly gained millions of dollars, and to purchasers who have concededly, and I think unconstitutionally, lost those millions. It appears odd to me also to have the Court support its holding on what is nothing more than the Court's theory that all Texas has done is \"technically alter an obligation of a contract.\" Much as has been said about the wealth of Texas, I was unaware until now \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 531]\n\u00a0\n that a multi-million dollar windfall for that State could be dismissed as a mere technicality; it sounds like more than a technicality to me, and perhaps to the purchasers whose rights Texas took away from them.\n\nLet us now look at some of the weights the Court throws on the scales on the side of Texas: thousands of purchase contracts were forfeited from time to time by failure of purchasers to pay interest; forfeited claims under many of these contracts could be reinstated by purchasers \"if and when the land became potentially productive of gas and oil\"; some of the purchases were made for speculative purposes; purchasers thwarted efforts of Texas to repurchase the lands in order to resell them at a higher value; the lands went up in value as the years rolled by, which caused Texas to \"lose\" millions of dollars; much litigation arose between the State and contract purchasers; the State's policy of quick resale of forfeited lands, in order to cause rights of third parties to intervene, did not prove successful; the market for land contracted during the depression; clouds on titles arose because of reinstatement rights on land which Texas had resold; \"interest\" and \"necessity\" prompted Texas to pass the 1941 law repudiating its contractual reinstatement rights; carrying out the obligations would have been \"quite costly to the school fund and to the development of land use\"; when the land here involved was sold to El Paso in breach of the State's obligation to Simmons, El Paso was \"`in urgent need of expanding its sources of water'\"; the State needed more money for its school fund and for efficient utilization of its public lands, money which it could get painlessly if it was allowed to repudiate these obligations, which were \"impediments\" to the State's desire to raise money by reselling these lands for a higher price.\n\nI do not believe that any or all of the things set out above on which the Court relies are reasons for relieving Texas of the unconditional duty of keeping its contractual \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 532]\n\u00a0\n obligations as required by the Contract Clause. At most the Court's reasons boil down to the fact that Texas' contracts, perhaps very wisely made a long time ago,\n22\n turned out when land soared in value, and particularly after oil was discovered, to be costly to the State. As the Court euphemistically puts it, the contracts were \"not wholly effectual to serve the objectives of the State's land program many decades later. Settlement was no longer the objective, but revenues . . .\" among other things were. In plainer language, the State decided it had made a bad deal and wanted out. There is nothing unusual in this. It is a commonplace that land values steadily rise when population increases and rise sharply when valuable minerals are discovered, and that many sellers would be much richer and happier if when lands go up in value they were able to welch on their sales. No plethora of words about state school funds can conceal the fact that to get money easily without having to tax the whole public Texas took the easy way out and violated the Contract Clause of the Constitution as written and as applied up to now. If the values of these lands and of valid contracts to buy them have increased, that increase belongs in equity as well as in sound constitutional interpretation not to Texas, but to the many people who agreed to these contracts under what now turns out to have been a mistaken belief that Texas would keep the obligations it gave to those who dealt with it.\n\nAll this for me is just another example of the delusiveness of calling \"balancing\" a \"test.\" With its deprecatory view of the equities on the side of Simmons and other claimants and its remarkable sympathy for the State, the Court through its balancing process states the case in a way inevitably destined to bypass the Contract Clause and let Texas break its solemn obligation. As the Court's \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 533]\n\u00a0\n opinion demonstrates, constitutional adjudication under the balancing method becomes simply a matter of this Court's deciding for itself which result in a particular case seems in the circumstances the more acceptable governmental policy and then stating the facts in such a way that the considerations in the balance lead to the result. Even if I believed that we as Justices of this Court had the authority to rely on our judgment of what is best for the country instead of trying to interpret the language and purpose of our written Constitution, I would not agree that Texas should be permitted to do what it has done here. But more importantly, I most certainly cannot agree that constitutional law is simply a matter of what the Justices of this Court decide is not harmful for the country, and therefore is \"reasonable.\" Cf. Ferguson v. Skrupa, \n372 \nU.S. 726\n; Federal Power Comm'n v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575, 599\n (concurring opinion). James Madison said that the Contract Clause was intended to protect people from the \"fluctuating policy\" of the legislature. The Federalist, No. 44, at 301 (Cooke ed. 1961). Today's majority holds that people are not protected from the fluctuating policy of the legislature, so long as the legislature acts in accordance with the fluctuating policy of this Court.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nIn spite of all the Court's discussion of clouds on land titles and need for \"efficient utilization\" of land, the real issue in this case is not whether Texas has constitutional power to pass legislation to correct these problems, by limiting reinstatements to five years following forfeiture. I think that there was and is a constitutional way for Texas to do this. But I think the Fifth Amendment forbids Texas to do so without compensating the holders of contractual rights for the interests it wants to destroy. Contractual rights, this Court has held, are property, and \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 534]\n\u00a0\n the Fifth Amendment requires that property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571\n; see also Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n; cf. United States v. General Motors Corp., \n323 \nU.S. 373\n. This constitutional requirement is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. See Griggs v. Allegheny County, \n369 \nU.S. 84, 85\n; Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 415\n; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 241\n. The need to clear titles and stabilize the market in land would certainly be a valid public purpose to sustain exercise of the State's power of eminent domain, and while the Contract Clause protects the value of the property right in contracts, it does not stand in the way of a State's taking those property rights as it would any other property, provided it is willing to pay for what it has taken. Contributors to the Pennsylvania Hospital v. City of Philadelphia, \n245 \nU.S. 20\n; City of Cincinnati v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 390\n; Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685\n; West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507. The Texas statute which the Court upholds, however, took away Simmons' contract rights without any compensation.\n\nThe Court seems to say that because it was \"necessary\" to raise money and clear titles, Texas was not obligated to pay for rights which it took. I suppose that if Texas were building a highway and a man's house stood in the way, it would be \"necessary\" to tear it down. Until today I had thought there could be no doubt that he would be entitled to just compensation. Yet the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect his rights no more nor less than they do those of people to whom Texas was contractually obligated. Texas' \"necessity\" as seen by this Court is the mother of a regrettable judicial invention which I think has no place in our constitutional \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 535]\n\u00a0\n law.\n23\n Our Constitution provides that property needed for public use, whether for schools or highways or any other public purpose, shall be paid for out of tax-raised funds fairly contributed by all the taxpayers, not just by a few purchasers of land who trusted the State not wisely but too well. It is not the happiest of days for me when one of our wealthiest States is permitted to enforce a law that breaks faith with those who contracted with it. Cf. Federal Power Comm'n v. Tuscarora Indian Nation, \n362 \nU.S. 99, 124\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" U.S. Const., Amend.

The Texas Legislature in 1955 sold it to El Paso for the fair market value to be appraised, \"but no less than $6.50 per acre.\" Tex. Gen. & Spec. Laws 1955, ch. 278.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Tex. Gen. & Spec. Laws 1941, ch. 191, 3, as amended, Vernon's Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5326.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] I cannot agree with the Court's dictum that the Texas cases on this point are unclear. I do not think they could be much clearer. In Gulf Production Co. v. State, 231 S. W. 124, 131, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals said:\n\n\"The provisions for reinstatement were in effect when Kidd purchased the land, and were embraced in the contract between the state and Kidd when the latter purchased, and neither Kidd nor the state could thereafter arbitrarily and without the consent of the other write into the contract any provision or condition varying, restricting, or enlarging the terms thereof.\"\n\n\n The court also observed:\n\n\"The primary object of the state in placing its public domain upon the market was the securing of actual settlers on these lands. The revenues to be derived from sales was but a secondary consideration, a mere incident to the greater purpose of supplying homes to those who sought and lived in them in good faith. The wisdom of this policy of our forefathers has never been seriously questioned, and the provision for the reinstatement of sales forfeited was an expression of the spirit of that policy. It was right and just that those who had settled upon and improved the state's lands in response to the invitation of the state, and who had endured the hardships incident to such settlement, and the privations incident to such improvement, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 521]\n\u00a0\n should be given an opportunity to retrieve their lands when forfeited by reason of temporary misfortunes and the consequent inability to meet their payments in strict compliance with their obligations. Forfeitures by statute or contract are not favored. They must be viewed with a cold and literal scrutiny, that the injury wrought may be held to the minimum. On the other hand, statutes or contracts designed to relieve from the rigors of forfeiture are looked upon warmly and construed liberally, so as to afford the maximum relief. And this reciprocal rule applies as well to the great state of Texas as to its humblest citizen.\" 231 S. W., at 131. Cf. State v. Walden, 325 S. W. 2d 705 (Tex. Civ. App.).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Fletcher v. Peck also made clear that the Constitution forbids impairment of a contract whether the contract be executed or, as here, executory. 6 Cranch, at 136-137.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 4 Wheat., at 200.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See also, e. g., Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, and cases there cited; Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 430\n, 434, and cases there cited at n. 13; Oshkosh Waterworks Co. v. Oshkosh, \n187 \nU.S. 437, 439\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 4 Wheat., at 197-198.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Blaisdell opinion said, \n290 \nU.S., at 430\n:\n\n\"Chief Justice Marshall pointed out the distinction between obligation and remedy. Sturges v. Crowninshield, supra, p. 200. Said he: \"The distinction between the obligation of a contract, and the remedy given by the legislature to enforce that obligation, has been taken at the bar, and exists in the nature of things. Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the nation shall direct.' And in Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, supra, pp. 553, 554, the general statement above quoted was limited by the further observation that `It is competent for the States to change the form of the remedy, or to modify it otherwise, as they may see fit, provided no substantial right secured by the contract is thereby impaired. No attempt has been made to fix definitely the line between alterations of the remedy, which are to be deemed legitimate, and those which, under the form of modifying the remedy, impair substantial rights. Every case must be determined upon its own circumstances.'\"\n\n\n Later, in Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, Chief Justice Hughes, the author of Blaisdell, quoted with approval the following language from the opinion which he had joined in Richmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., \n300 \nU.S. 124, 128\n:\n\n\"The legislature may modify, limit or alter the remedy for enforcement of a contract without impairing its obligation, but in so doing, it may not deny all remedy or so circumscribe the existing remedy with conditions and restrictions as seriously to impair the value of the right.\"\n\n\n Chief Justice Hughes in the Jacobs case also referred to numerous past cases as having drawn this distinction, including among them \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 525]\n\u00a0\n Blaisdell. See \n306 \nU.S., at 542\n. He concluded that \"[t]he reasoning of this Court in Richmond Mortgage Corp. v. Wachovia Bank, supra, is applicable and governs our decision.\" \n306 \nU.S., at 543\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] \n290 \nU.S., at 439\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Id., at 440. Mr. Justice Brandeis in discussing Blaisdell the following year said that the statute in that case had been upheld because it had been found \"to preserve substantially the right\" of the mortgagee to obtain payment. Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555, 581\n. See also id., at 597-598.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] One scholar who made a study of all the decisions of this Court concerning the Contract Clause had this to say about Blaisdell:\n\n\"The Blaisdell case, in the light of subsequent decisions, appears now to have decided merely the very narrow question of the validity of the particular statute under the specific circumstances there existing. So far as any general rule may be said to have emerged, it is merely an apparently limited extension of the principle that reasonable modification of the remedy, especially if adequate time is left for compliance, does not constitute an impairment of the obligation of contracts. If any advance has been made, it consists in that economic conditions may create an emergency in which a scrupulously drafted statute may call upon the police power to grant wide discretion to courts in extending temporary and conditional relief to debtors.\" Wright, The Contract Clause of the Constitution, 119.\n\n\n Compare the following language of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Wright v. Vinton Branch, \n300 \nU.S. 440, 469\n:\n\n\"[I]t is urged that the limitations here placed upon the enforcement of the mortgage are not merely a modification of the remedy recognized as permissible. Compare Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 434\n.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] I dissented in Wood v. Lovett, \n313 \nU.S., at 372\n, because, as I there pointed out, I believed that the state law in that case, which protected purchasers of land against loss even though their titles were based only on quitclaim deeds, should have been upheld under Blaisdell. Even had my dissent prevailed, however, that case would not have supported the Court's holding in the case before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] None of the cases mentioned by the Court involved legislation by which a State attempted to repudiate its own contractual obligation without giving compensation, nor did any of them come near suggesting or implying that a State might do so. Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n, in an opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, upheld a state statute providing that a mortgagee who bid at a foreclosure sale could not obtain a deficiency judgment if the value of the property equaled or exceeded the amount of the debt plus costs and interest; the Court said that the mortgagee under this law received all the compensation to which his contract entitled him, and that the statute \"merely restricted the exercise of the contractual remedy . . . .\" Id., at 544, quoting from Richmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., \n300 \nU.S. 124, 131\n. Veix v. Sixth Ward Building & Loan Assn., \n310 \nU.S. 32\n, held only that by issuing shares of stock at a time when state law permitted shareholders to withdraw their shares in exchange for a cash refund a private company regulated by the State could not prevent the State from applying later general legislation forbidding shareholders to sue for the withdrawal value; this rule of course had been recognized in Blaisdell and in cases which it cited, e. g., Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349\n, and Manigault v. Springs, \n199 \nU.S. 473\n. Gelfert v. National City Bank, \n313 \nU.S. 221\n, upheld a New York law which redefined fair market value of property purchased by mortgagees at foreclosure sales; again emphasizing \n\n[379 \nU.S. 497, 528]\n\u00a0\n that contracts between private persons could not prevent application of general regulatory laws, the Court held that this law was merely a regulation of the remedy, and did not affect any substantial right given by the contract, relying on Honeyman v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 539\n; Richmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., \n300 \nU.S. 124\n; and Blaisdell. Faitoute Iron & Steel Co. v. City of Asbury Park, \n316 \nU.S. 502\n, which upheld a law binding all the creditors of a municipal corporation to an adjustment of claims if 85% of them agreed, said simply that as a practical matter the law rather than impairing the creditors' contracts was necessary to keep them from becoming worthless. East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn, \n326 \nU.S. 230\n, upheld a mortgage moratorium law much like that in Blaisdell; the Court pointed out that the law protected creditors from loss by requiring debtors to pay taxes, insurance, interest and installments on the principal, and again emphasized, citing Manigault v. Springs, supra, that private persons could not escape state economic regulatory legislation simply because they previously had entered contracts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] See Part IV, pp. 533-535, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] See, e. g., Rochin v.

TEXAS(1965)\nNo. 256\nArgued: April 1, 1965Decided: June 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner had been indicted by a Texas county grand jury for swindling. Massive pretrial publicity had given the case national notoriety. On the trial date, following a change of venue, a hearing commenced on petitioner's motion to prevent telecasting, radio broadcasting, and news photography. The bearing, conducted in the presence of some trial witnesses and veniremen later released, was carried live on television and radio, and news photography was permitted. The original jury panel, petitioner, counsel, and the trial judge were highly publicized during the two days the pretrial hearing lasted, emphasizing throughout the community the notorious character that the trial would take. Four of the jurors selected later at the trial had seen or heard all or part of the broadcasts. The profusion of cameramen with their equipment in various parts of the crowded courtroom caused considerable disruption. The trial court denied petitioner's motion but granted a continuance of almost a month. During the interim a booth was erected in the rear of the courtroom to which television cameramen and equipment were restricted. Live telecasting was prohibited during most of the actual trial. The State's opening and closing arguments were carried live with sound (though because of mechanical difficulty there was no picture of the former), as were the return of the jury's verdict and its receipt by the judge. The court's order allowed videotapes without sound of the whole proceeding and the cameras operated intermittently during the three day trial, which ended with petitioner's conviction. Film clips of the trial were shown largely on regularly scheduled news programs. Both the trial court and the appellate court rejected petitioner's claim of denial of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by the televising and broadcasting of the trial. Held: The televising over petitioner's objections of the courtroom proceedings of petitioner's criminal trial, in which there was widespread public interest, was inherently invalid as infringing the fundamental right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 536-552.\n\n (a) The high degree of publicity given to the two-day hearing, which could only have impressed those present and the community \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n at large with the notorious character of the petitioner and the proceeding, made what occurred at the pretrial relevant to determining whether petitioner was accorded due process at his trial. Pp. 536-537.\n\n\n (b) The constitutional guarantee of a public trial is to ensure that the accused is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned. Pp. 538-539.\n\n\n (c) The freedom granted to the press under the First Amendment must be subject to the maintenance of absolute fairness in the judicial process; and in the present state of television techniques such freedom does not confer the right to use equipment in the courtroom which might jeopardize a fair trial, the atmosphere for which must be preserved at all costs. Pp. 539-540.\n\n\n (d) The public's right to be informed about court proceedings is satisfied if reporters are free to attend and to report on the proceedings through their respective media. Pp. 541-542.\n\n\n (e) Where, as here, the procedure employed by the State involves the probability that prejudice to the accused will result, that procedure, in line with the principle established in such cases as Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n, will be deemed lacking in due process whether or not isolatable prejudice can be demonstrated. Pp. 542-544.\n\n\n (f) There are numerous respects in which televising court proceedings may alone, and in combination almost certainly will, cause unfairness, such as: (1) improperly influencing jurors by emphasizing the notoriety of the trial and affecting their impartial judgment, distracting their attention, facilitating (in States which do not sequester jurors) their viewing of selected parts of the proceedings, and improperly influencing potential jurors and thus jeopardizing the fairness of new trials; (2) impairing the testimony of witnesses, as by causing some to be frightened and others to overstate their testimony, and generally influencing the testimony of witnesses, thus frustrating invocation of the \"rule\" against witnesses; (3) distracting judges generally and exercising an adverse psychological effect particularly upon those who are elected; and (4) imposing pressures upon the defendant and intruding into the confidential attorney-client relationship. Pp. 544-550.\n\n\n (g) The foregoing factors are not merely \"hypothetical,\" as is evidenced by the bar on television in federal criminal trials imposed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and by such a bar in all but two States. P. 550. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (h) Application of the rule of the Rideau case supra, is clearly warranted by the facts of this case. Pp. 550-552.\n\n\n\n Reversed.\n\n\nJohn D. Cofer and Hume Cofer argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\n\nWaggoner Carr, Attorney General of Texas, and Leon Jaworski, Special Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause for respondent. With them on the brief were Hawthorne Phillips, Stanton Stone. Howard M. Fender and Gilbert J. Pena, Assistant Attorneys General, and Alton F. Curry, Special Assistant Attorney General.\n\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging reversal, were filed by Whitney North Seymour, Richmond C. Coburn and John H. Yauch for the American Bar Association, and by Norman Dorsen and Melvin L. Wulf for the American Civil Liberties Union et al.\n\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging affirmance, were filed by Davis Grant for the State Bar of Texas, joined by Duke W. Dunbar, Attorney General of Colorado; and by Douglas A. Anello, W. Theodore Pierson and Harold David Cohen for the National Association of Broadcasters et al.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe question presented here is whether the petitioner, who stands convicted in the District Court for the Seventh Judicial District of Texas at Tyler for swindling,\n1\n was \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 535]\n\u00a0\n deprived of his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to due process by the televising and broadcasting of his trial. Both the trial court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found against the petitioner. We hold to the contrary and reverse his conviction.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\nWhile petitioner recites his claim in the framework of Canon 35 of the Judicial Canons of the American Bar Association he does not contend that we should enshrine Canon 35 in the Fourteenth Amendment, but only that the time-honored principles of a fair trial were not followed in his case and that he was thus convicted without due process of law. Canon 35, of course, has of itself no binding effect on the courts but merely expresses the view of the Association in opposition to the broadcasting, televising and photographing of court proceedings. Likewise, Judicial Canon 28 of the Integrated State Bar of Texas, 27 Tex. B. J. 102 (1964), which leaves to the trial judge's sound discretion the telecasting and photographing of court proceedings, is of itself not law. In short, the question here is not the validity of either Canon 35 of the American Bar Association or Canon 28 of the State Bar of Texas, but only whether petitioner was tried in a manner which comports with the due process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\nPetitioner's case was originally called for trial on September 24, 1962, in Smith County after a change of venue from Reeves County, some 500 miles west. Massive pretrial publicity totaling 11 volumes of press clippings, which are on file with the Clerk, had given it national notoriety. All available seats in the courtroom were taken and some 30 persons stood in the aisles. However, at that time a defense motion to prevent telecasting, broadcasting by radio and news photography and a defense motion for continuance were presented, and after a two-day hearing the former was denied and the latter granted. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThese initial hearings were carried live by both radio and television, and news photography was permitted throughout. The videotapes of these hearings clearly illustrate that the picture presented was not one of that judicial serenity and calm to which petitioner was entitled. Cf. Wood v. Georgia, \n370 \nU.S. 375, 383\n (1962); Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466, 472\n (1965); Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 562\n (1965). Indeed, at least 12 cameramen were engaged in the courtroom throughout the hearing taking motion and still pictures and televising the proceedings. Cables and wires were snaked across the courtroom floor, three microphones were on the judge's bench and others were beamed at the jury box and the counsel table. It is conceded that the activities of the television crews and news photographers led to considerable disruption of the hearings. Moreover, venire men had been summoned and were present in the courtroom during the entire hearing but were later released after petitioner's motion for continuance had been granted. The court also had the names of the witnesses called; some answered but the absence of others led to a continuance of the case until October 22, 1962. It is contended that this two-day pretrial hearing cannot be considered in determining the question before us. We cannot agree. Pretrial can create a major problem for the defendant in a criminal case. Indeed, it may be more harmful than publicity during the trial for it may well set the community opinion as to guilt or innocence. Though the September hearings dealt with motions to prohibit television coverage and to postpone the trial, they are unquestionably relevant to the issue before us. All of this two-day affair was highly publicized and could only have impressed those present, and also the community at large, with the notorious character of the petitioner as well as the proceeding. The trial witnesses present at the hearing, as well as the original jury panel, were undoubtedly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 537]\n\u00a0\n made aware of the peculiar public importance of the case by the press and television coverage being provided, and by the fact that they themselves were televised live and their pictures rebroadcast on the evening show.\n\n\nWhen the case was called for trial on October 22 the scene had been altered. A booth had been constructed at the back of the courtroom which was painted to blend with the permanent structure of the room. It had an aperture to allow the lens of the cameras an unrestricted view of the courtroom. All television cameras and newsreel photographers were restricted to the area of the booth when shooting film or telecasting.\n\n\nBecause of continual objection, the rules governing live telecasting, as well as radio and still photos, were changed as the exigencies of the situation seemed to require. As a result, live telecasting was prohibited during a great portion of the actual trial. Only the opening\n2\n and closing arguments of the State, the return of the jury's verdict and its receipt by the trial judge were carried live with sound. Although the order allowed videotapes of the entire proceeding without sound, the cameras operated only intermittently. recording various portions of the trial for broadcast on regularly scheduled newscasts later in the day and evening. At the request of the petitioner. the trial judge prohibited coverage of any kind, still or television, of the defense counsel during their summations to the jury.\n\n\nBecause of the varying restrictions placed on sound and live telecasting the telecasts of the trial were confined largely to film clips shown on the stations' regularly scheduled news programs. The news commentators would use the film of a particular part of the day's trial activities as a backdrop for their reports. Their commentary \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 538]\n\u00a0\n included excerpts from testimony and the usual reportorial remarks. On one occasion the videotapes of the September hearings were rebroadcast in place of the \"late movie.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n\nIn Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n (1963), this Court constructed a rule that the televising of a defendant in the act of confessing to a crime was inherently invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment even without a showing of prejudice or a demonstration of the nexus between the televised confession and the trial. See id., at 729 (dissenting opinion of CLARK, J.). Here, although there was nothing so dramatic as a home-viewed confession, there had been a bombardment of the community with the sights and sounds of a two-day hearing during which the original jury panel, the petitioner, the lawyers and the judge were highly publicized. The petitioner was subjected to characterization and minute electronic scrutiny to such an extent that at one point the photographers were found attempting to picture the page of the paper from which he was reading while sitting at the counsel table. The two-day hearing and the order permitting television at the actual trial were widely known throughout the community. This emphasized the notorious character that the trial would take and, therefore, set it apart in the public mind as an extraordinary case or, as Shaw would say, something \"not conventionally unconventional.\" When the new jury was empaneled at the trial four of the jurors selected had seen and heard all or part of the broadcasts of the earlier proceedings.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the proposition that it is a \"public trial\" that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to the \"accused.\" The purpose of the requirement of a public trial was to guarantee that the accused would be fairly dealt with and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n not unjustly condemned. History had proven that secret tribunals were effective instruments of oppression. As our Brother BLACK so well said in In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n (1948):\n\n \"The traditional Anglo-American distrust for secret trials has been variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the Spanish Inquisition, to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber, and to the French monarchy's abuse of the lettre de cachet. . . . Whatever other benefits the guarantee to an accused that his trial be conducted in public may confer upon our society, the guarantee has always been recognized as a safeguard against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.\" At 268-270. (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n\n It is said, however, that the freedoms granted in the First Amendment extend a right to the news media to televise from the courtroom, and that to refuse to honor this privilege is to discriminate between the newspapers and television. This is a misconception of the rights of the press.\n\n\nThe free press has been a mighty catalyst in awakening public interest in governmental affairs, exposing corruption among public officers and employees and generally informing the citizenry of public events and occurrences, including court proceedings. While maximum freedom must be allowed the press in carrying on this important function in a democratic society its exercise must necessarily be subject to the maintenance of absolute fairness in the judicial process. While the state and federal courts have differed over what spectators may be excluded from a criminal trial, 6 Wigmore, Evidence 1834 (3d ed. 1940), the amici curiae brief of the National Association of Broadcasters and the Radio Television News Directors Association, says, as indeed it must, that \"neither of these two amendments [First and Sixth] speaks of an unlimited \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n right of access to the courtroom on the part of the broadcasting media . . . .\" At 7. Moreover, they recognize that the \"primary concern of all must be the proper administration of justice\"; that \"the life or liberty of any individual in this land should not be put in jeopardy because of actions of any news media\"; and that \"the due process requirements in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the provisions of the Sixth Amendment require a procedure that will assure a fair trial. . . .\" At 3-4.\n\n\nNor can the courts be said to discriminate where they permit the newspaper reporter access to the courtroom. The television and radio reporter has the same privilege. All are entitled to the same rights as the general public. The news reporter is not permitted to bring his typewriter or printing press. When the advances in these arts permit reporting by printing press or by television without their present hazards to a fair trial we will have another case.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n\nCourt proceedings are held for the solemn purpose of endeavoring to ascertain the truth which is the sine qua non of a fair trial. Over the centuries Anglo-American courts have devised careful safeguards by rule and otherwise to protect and facilitate the performance of this high function. As a result. at this time those safeguards do not permit the televising and photographing of a criminal trial, save in two States and there only under restrictions. The federal courts prohibit it by specific rule. This is weighty evidence that our concepts of a fair trial do not tolerate such an indulgence. We have always held that the atmosphere essential to the preservation of a fair trial - the most fundamental of all freedoms - must be maintained at all costs. Our approach has been through rules, contempt proceedings and reversal of convictions obtained under unfair conditions. Here the remedy is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n clear and certain of application and it is our duty to continue to enforce the principles that from time immemorial have proven efficacious and necessary to a fair trial.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\n\nThe State contends that the televising of portions of a criminal trial does not constitute a denial of due process. Its position is that because no prejudice has been shown by the petitioner as resulting from the televising, it is permissible; that claims of \"distractions\" during the trial due to the physical presence of television are wholly unfounded; and that psychological considerations are for psychologists, not courts, because they are purely hypothetical. It argues further that the public has a right to know what goes on in the courts; that the court has no power to \"suppress, edit, or censor events which transpire in proceedings before it,\" citing Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367, 374\n (1947); and that the televising of criminal trials would be enlightening to the public and would promote greater respect for the courts.\n\n\nAt the outset the notion should be dispelled that telecasting is dangerous because it is new. It is true that our empirical knowledge of its full effect on the public, the jury or the participants in a trial, including the judge, witnesses and lawyers, is limited. However, the nub of the question is not its newness but, as Mr. JUSTICE DOUGLAS says, \"the insidious influences which it puts to work in the administration of justice.\" Douglas, The Public Trial and the Free Press, 33 Rocky Mt. L. Rev. 1 (1960). These influences will be detailed below, but before turning to them the State's argument that the public has a right to know what goes on in the courtroom should be dealt with.\n\n\nIt is true that the public has the right to be informed as to what occurs in its courts, but reporters of all media, including television, are always present if they wish to be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n and are plainly free to report whatever occurs in open court through their respective media. This was settled in Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n (1941), and Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331\n (1946), which we reaffirm. These reportorial privileges of the press were stated years ago:\n\n \"The law, however, favors publicity in legal proceedings, so far as that object can be attained without injustice to the persons immediately concerned. The public are permitted to attend nearly all judicial inquiries, and there appears to be no sufficient reason why they should not also be allowed to see in print the reports of trials, if they can thus have them presented as fully as they are exhibited in court, or at least all the material portion of the proceedings impartially stated, so that one shall not, by means of them, derive erroneous impressions, which he would not have been likely to receive from hearing the trial itself.\" 2 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations 931-932 (Carrington ed. 1927).\n\n\n\n The State, however, says that the use of television in the instant case was \"without injustice to the person immediately concerned,\" basing its position on the fact that the petitioner has established no isolatable prejudice and that this must be shown in order to invalidate a conviction in these circumstances. The State paints too broadly in this contention, for this Court itself has found instances in which a showing of actual prejudice is not a prerequisite to reversal. This is such a case. It is true that in most cases involving claims of due process deprivations we require a showing of identifiable prejudice to the accused. Nevertheless, at times a procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n process. Such a case was In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133\n (1955), where Mr. JUSTICE BLACK for the Court pointed up with his usual clarity and force:\n\n \"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. . . . [T]o perform its high function in the best way `justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.' Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11, 14\n.\" At 136. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n And, as Chief Justice Taft said in Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, almost 30 years before:\n\n\"the requirement of due process of law in judicial procedure is not satisfied by the argument that men of the highest honor and the greatest self-sacrifice could carry it on without danger of injustice. Every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man . . . to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.\" At 532. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n This rule was followed in Rideau, supra, and in Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466\n (1965). In each of these cases the Court departed from the approach it charted in Stroble v. California, \n343 \nU.S. 181\n (1952). and in Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n (1961), where we made a careful examination of the facts in order to determine whether prejudice resulted. In Rideau and Turner the Court did not stop to consider the actual effect of the practice but struck down the conviction on the ground that prejudice was inherent in it. Likewise in Gideon v. Wainwright, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 544]\n\u00a0\n \n372 \nU.S. 335\n (1963), and White v. Maryland, \n373 \nU.S. 59\n (1963), we applied the same rule, although in different contexts.\n\n\nIn this case it is even clearer that such a rule must be applied. In Rideau, Irvin and Stroble, the pretrial publicity occurred outside the courtroom and could not be effectively curtailed. The only recourse other than reversal was by contempt proceedings. In Turner the probability of prejudice was present through the use of deputy sheriffs, who were also witnesses in the case, as shepherds for the jury. No prejudice was shown but the circumstances were held to be inherently suspect, and, therefore, such a showing was not held to be a requisite to reversal. Likewise in this case the application of this principle is especially appropriate. Television in its present state and by its very nature, reaches into a variety of areas in which it may cause prejudice to an accused. Still one cannot put his finger on its specific mischief and prove with particularity wherein he was prejudiced. This was found true in Murchison, Tumey, Rideau and Turner. Such untoward circumstances as were found in those cases are inherently bad and prejudice to the accused was presumed. Forty-eight of our States and the Federal Rules have deemed the use of television improper in the courtroom. This fact is most telling in buttressing our conclusion that any change in procedure which would permit its use would be inconsistent with our concepts of due process in this field.\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n\n\nAs has been said, the chief function of our judicial machinery is to ascertain the truth. The use of television, however, cannot be said to contribute materially to this objective. Rather its use amounts to the injection of an irrelevant factor into court proceedings. In addition experience teaches that there are numerous situations \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 545]\n\u00a0\n in which it might cause actual unfairness - some so subtle as to defy detection by the accused or control by the judge. We enumerate some in summary:\n\n\n1. The potential impact of television on the jurors is perhaps of the greatest significance. They are the nerve center of the fact-finding process. It is true that in States like Texas where they are required to be sequestered in trials of this nature the jurors will probably not see any of the proceedings as televised from the courtroom. But the inquiry cannot end there. From the moment the trial judge announces that a case will be televised it becomes a cause celebre. The whole community, including prospective jurors, becomes interested in all the morbid details surrounding it. The approaching trial immediately assumes an important status in the public press and the accused is highly publicized along with the offense with which he is charged. Every juror carries with him into the jury box these solemn facts and thus increases the chance of prejudice that is present in every criminal case. And we must remember that realistically it is only the notorious trial which will be broadcast, because of the necessity for paid sponsorship. The conscious or unconscious effect that this may have on the juror's judgment cannot be evaluated, but experience indicates that it is not only possible but highly probable that it will have a direct bearing on his vote as to guilt or innocence. Where pretrial publicity of all kinds has created intense public feeling which is aggravated by the telecasting or picturing of the trial the televised jurors cannot help but feel the pressures of knowing that friends and neighbors have their eyes upon them. If the community be hostile to an accused a televised juror, realizing that he must return to neighbors who saw the trial themselves, may well be led \"not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused . . . .\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMoreover, while it is practically impossible to assess the effect of television on jury attentiveness, those of us who know juries realize the problem of jury \"distraction.\" The State argues this is de minimis since the physical disturbances have been eliminated. But we know that distractions are not caused solely by the physical presence of the camera and its telltale red lights. It is the awareness of the fact of telecasting that is felt by the juror throughout the trial. We are all self-conscious and uneasy when being televised. Human nature being what it is, not only will a juror's eyes be fixed on the camera, but also his mind will be preoccupied with the telecasting rather than with the testimony.\n\n\nFurthermore, in many States the jurors serving in the trial may see the broadcasts of the trial proceedings. Admittedly, the Texas sequestration rule would prevent this occurring there.\n3\n In other States following no such practice jurors would return home and turn on the TV if only to see how they appeared upon it. They would also be subjected to re-enactment and emphasis of the selected parts of the proceedings which the requirements of the broadcasters determined would be telecast and would be subconsciously influenced the more by that testimony. Moreover, they would be subjected to the broadest commentary and criticism and perhaps the well-meant advice of friends, relatives and inquiring strangers who recognized them on the streets.\n\nFinally, new trials plainly would be jeopardized in that potential jurors will often have seen and heard the original trial when it was telecast. Yet viewers may later \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 547]\n\u00a0\n be called upon to sit in the jury box during the new trial. These very dangers are illustrated in this case where the court, due to the defendant's objections, permitted only the State's opening and closing arguments to be broadcast with sound to the public.\n\n\n2. \nThe quality of the testimony in criminal trials will often be impaired. The impact upon a witness of the knowledge that he is being viewed by a vast audience is simply incalculable. Some may be demoralized and frightened, some cocky and given to overstatement; memories may falter, as with anyone speaking publicly, and accuracy of statement may be severely undermined. Embarrassment may impede the search for the truth, as may a natural tendency toward overdramatization. Furthermore, inquisitive strangers and \"cranks\" might approach witnesses on the street with jibes, advice or demands for explanation of testimony. There is little wonder that the defendant cannot \"prove\" the existence of such factors. Yet we all know from experience that they exist.\n\n\nIn addition the invocation of the rule against witnesses is frustrated. In most instances witnesses would be able to go to their homes and view broadcasts of the day's trial proceedings, notwithstanding the fact that they had been admonished not to do so. They could view and hear the testimony of preceding witnesses, and so shape their own testimony as to make its impact crucial. And even in the absence of sound, the influences of such viewing on the attitude of the witness toward testifying, his frame of mind upon taking the stand or his apprehension of withering cross-examination defy objective assessment. Indeed, the mere fact that the trial is to be televised might render witnesses reluctant to appear and thereby impede the trial as well as the discovery of the truth. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 548]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile some of the dangers mentioned above are present as well in newspaper coverage of any important trial, the circumstances and extraneous influences intruding upon the solemn decorum of court procedure in the televised trial are far more serious than in cases involving only newspaper coverage.\n\n\n3. A major aspect of the problem is the additional responsibilities the presence of television places on the trial judge. His job is to make certain that the accused receives a fair trial. This most difficult task requires his undivided attention. Still when television comes into the courtroom he must also supervise it. In this trial, for example, the judge on several different occasions - aside from the two days of pretrial - was obliged to have a hearing or enter an order made necessary solely because of the presence of television. Thus, where telecasting is restricted as it was here, and as even the State concedes it must be, his task is made much more difficult and exacting. And, as happened here, such rulings may unfortunately militate against the fairness of the trial. In addition, laying physical interruptions aside, there is the everpresent distraction that the mere awareness of television's presence prompts. Judges are human beings also and are subject to the same psychological reactions as laymen. Telecasting is particularly bad where the judge is elected, as is the case in all save a half dozen of our States. The telecasting of a trial becomes a political weapon, which, along with other distractions inherent in broadcasting, diverts his attention from the task at hand - the fair trial of the accused.\n\n\nBut this is not all. There is the initial decision that must be made as to whether the use of television will be permitted. This is perhaps an even more crucial consideration. Our judges are high-minded men and women. But it is difficult to remain oblivious to the pressures that the news media can bring to bear on them both directly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 549]\n\u00a0\n and through the shaping of public opinion. Moreover, where one judge in a district or even in a State permits telecasting, the requirement that the others do the same is almost mandatory. Especially is this true where the judge is selected at the ballot box.\n\n\n4. Finally, we cannot ignore the impact of courtroom television on the defendant. Its presence is a form of mental - if not physical - harassment, resembling a police line-up or the third degree. The inevitable close-ups of his gestures and expressions during the ordeal of his trial might well transgress his personal sensibilities, his dignity. and his ability to concentrate on the proceedings before him - sometimes the difference between life and death - dispassionately, freely and without the distraction of wide public surveillance. A defendant on trial for a specific crime is entitled to his day in court, not in a stadium, or a city or nationwide arena. The heightened public clamor resulting from radio and television coverage will inevitably result in prejudice. Trial by television is, therefore, foreign to our system. Furthermore, telecasting may also deprive an accused of effective counsel. The distractions, intrusions into confidential attorney-client relationships and the temptation offered by television to play to the public audience might often have a direct effect not only upon the lawyers, but the judge, the jury and the witnesses. See Pye, The Lessons of Dallas - Threats to Fair Trial and Free Press, National Civil Liberties Clearing House, 16th Annual Conference.\n\n\nThe television camera is a powerful weapon. Intentionally or inadvertently it can destroy an accused and his case in the eyes of the public. While our telecasters are honorable men. they too are human. The necessity for sponsorship weighs heavily in favor of the televising of only notorious cases, such as this one, and invariably focuses the lens upon the unpopular or infamous \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 550]\n\u00a0\n accused. Such a selection is necessary in order to obtain a sponsor willing to pay a sufficient fee to cover the costs and return a profit. We have already examined the ways in which public sentiment can affect the trial participants. To the extent that television shapes that sentiment, it can strip the accused of a fair trial.\n\n\nThe State would dispose of all these observations with the simple statement that they are for psychologists because they are purely hypothetical. But we cannot afford the luxury of saying that, because these factors are difficult of ascertainment in particular cases, they must be ignored. Nor are they \"purely hypothetical.\" They are no more hypothetical than were the considerations deemed controlling in Tumey, Murchison, Rideau and Turner. They are real enough to have convinced the Judicial Conference of the United States, this Court and the Congress that television should be barred in federal trials by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; in addition they have persuaded all but two of our States to prohibit television in the courtroom. They are effects that may, and in some combination almost certainly will, exist in any case in which television is injected into the trial process.\n\n\nVII.\n\n\n\n\nThe facts in this case demonstrate clearly the necessity for the application of the rule announced in Rideau. The sole issue before the court for two days of pretrial hearing was the question now before us. The hearing was televised live and repeated on tape in the same evening, reaching approximately 100,000 viewers. In addition, the courtroom was a mass of wires, television cameras, microphones and photographers. The petitioner, the panel of prospective jurors, who were sworn the second day, the witnesses and the lawyers were all exposed to this untoward situation. The judge decided that the trial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 551]\n\u00a0\n proceeding would be telecast. He announced no restrictions at the time. This emphasized the notorious nature of the coming trial, increased the intensity of the publicity on the petitioner and together with the subsequent televising of the trial beginning 30 days later inherently prevented a sober search for the truth. This is underscored by the fact that the selection of the jury took an entire week. As might be expected, a substantial amount of that time was devoted to ascertaining the impact of the pretrial televising on the prospective jurors. As we have noted, four of the jurors selected had seen all or part of those broadcasts. The trial, on the other hand, lasted only three days.\n\n\nMoreover, the trial judge was himself harassed. After the initial decision to permit telecasting he apparently decided that a booth should be built at the broadcasters' expense to confine its operations; he then decided to limit the parts of the trial that might be televised live; then he decided to film the testimony of the witnesses without sound in an attempt to protect those under the rule; and finally he ordered that defense counsel and their argument not be televised, in the light of their objection. Plagued by his original error - recurring each day of the trial - his day-to-day orders made the trial more confusing to the jury, the participants and to the viewers. Indeed, it resulted in a public presentation of only the State's side of the case.\n\n\nAs Mr. Justice Holmes said in Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n (1907):\n\n\"The theory of our system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\"\n\n\n\n It is said that the ever-advancing techniques of public communication and the adjustment of the public to its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 552]\n\u00a0\n presence may bring about a change in the effect of telecasting upon the fairness of criminal trials. But we are not dealing here with future developments in the field of electronics. Our judgment cannot be rested on the hypothesis of tomorrow but must take the facts as they are presented today.\n\n\nThe judgment is therefore\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Mr. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in this opinion subject to the reservations and to the extent indicated in his concurring opinion, post, p. 587.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The evidence indicated that petitioner, through false pretenses and fraudulent representations, induced certain farmers to purchase fertilizer tanks and accompanying equipment, which in fact did not exist, and to sign and deliver to him chattel mortgages on the fictitious property.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Due to mechanical difficulty there was no picture during the opening argument.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Only six States, in addition to Texas, require sequestration of the jury prior to its deliberations in a non-capital felony trial. The great majority of jurisdictions leave the matter to the trial judge's discretion, while in at least one State the jury will be kept together in such circumstances only upon a showing of cause by the defendant.\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG join, concurring.\n\n\nWhile I join the Court's opinion and agree that the televising of criminal trials is inherently a denial of due process. I desire to express additional views on why this is so. In doing this, I wish to emphasize that our condemnation of televised criminal trials is not based on generalities or abstract fears. The record in this case presents a vivid illustration of the inherent prejudice of televised criminal trials and supports our conclusion that this is the appropriate time to make a definitive appraisal of television in the courtroom.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\nPetitioner, a much-publicized financier, was indicted by a Reeves County, Texas, grand jury for obtaining property through false pretenses. The case was transferred to the City of Tyler, in Smith County, Texas, and was set for trial on September 24, 1962. Prior to that date petitioner's counsel informed the trial judge that he would make a motion on September 24 to exclude all cameras from the courtroom during the trial.\n\n\nOn September 24, a hearing was held to consider petitioner's motion to prohibit television, motion pictures, and still photography at the trial. The courtroom was filled with newspaper reporters and cameramen, television cameramen, and spectators. At least 12 cameramen with \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 553]\n\u00a0\n their equipment were seen by one observer, and there were 30 or more people standing in the aisles. An article appearing in the New York Times the next day stated:\n\n \"A television motor van, big as an intercontinental bus, was parked outside the courthouse and the second-floor courtroom was a forest of equipment. Two television cameras had been set up inside the bar and four more marked cameras were aligned just outside the gates. . . . [C]ables and wires snaked over the floor.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n With photographers roaming at will through the courtroom, petitioner's counsel made his motion that all cameras be excluded. As he spoke, a cameraman wandered behind the judge's bench and snapped his picture. Counsel argued that the presence of cameras would make it difficult for him to consult with his client, make his client ill at ease, and make it impossible to obtain a fair trial since the cameras would distract the jury, witnesses and lawyers. He also expressed the view that televising selected cases tends to give the jury an impression that the particular trial is different from ordinary criminal trials. The court, however, ruled that the taking of pictures and televising would be allowed so long as the cameramen stood outside the railing that separates the trial participants from the spectators. The court also ruled that if a complaint was made that any camera was too noisy, the cameramen would have to stop taking pictures; that no pictures could be taken in the corridors outside the courtroom; and that those with microphones were not to pick up conversations between petitioner and his lawyers. Subsequent to the court's ruling petitioner arrived in the courtroom,\n2\n and the defense introduced testimony \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 554]\n\u00a0\n concerning the atmosphere in the court on that day. At the conclusion of the day's hearing the judge reasserted his earlier ruling. He then ordered a roll call of the prosecution witnesses, at least some of whom had been in the courtroom during the proceedings.\n\n\nThe entire hearing on September 24 was televised live by station KLTV of Tyler. Texas, and station WFAA-TV of Dallas, Texas. Commercials were inserted when there was a pause in the proceedings. On the evening of Monday, September 24, both stations ran an edited tape of the day's proceedings and interrupted the tape to play the commercials ordinarily seen in the particular time slot. In addition to the live television coverage there was also a live radio pickup of the proceedings by at least one station.\n\n\nThe proceedings continued on September 25. There was again a significant number of cameramen taking motion pictures, still pictures and television pictures. The judge once more ordered cameramen to stay on the other side of the railing and stated that this order was to be observed even during court recesses. The panel from which the petit jury was to be selected was then sworn in the presence of the cameramen. The panel was excused to permit counsel to renew his motion to prohibit photography in the courtroom. The court denied the motion, but granted a continuance of trial until October 22 and dismissed the jury panel. At the suggestion of petitioner's counsel the trial judge warned the prosecution witnesses who were present not to discuss the case during the continuance. The proceedings were televised live and portions of the television tape were shown on the regularly scheduled evening news programs. Live radio transmission apparently occurred as on the day before.\n\n\nOn October 1, 1962, the trial judge issued an order explaining what coverage he would permit during the trial. The judge delivered the order in his chambers for the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 555]\n\u00a0\n benefit of television cameramen so that they could film him. The judge ruled that although he would permit television cameras to be present during the trial, they would not be permitted to present live coverage of the interrogation of prospective jurors or the testimony of witnesses. He ruled that each of the three major television networks, NBC, CBS, ABC, and the local television station KLTV could install one camera not equipped to pick up sound and the film would be available to other television stations on a pooled basis. In addition, he ruled that with respect to news photographers only cameramen for the local press, Associated Press, and United Press would be permitted in the courtroom. Photographs taken were also to be made available to others on a pooled basis. The judge did not explain how he decided which television cameramen and which still photographers were to be permitted in the courtroom and which were to be excluded.\n\n\nFor the proceedings beginning on October 22, station KLTV, at its own expense, and with the permission of the court, had constructed a booth in the rear of the courtroom painted the same or near the same color as the courtroom. An opening running lengthwise across the booth permitted the four television cameras to photograph the proceedings. The courtroom was small and the cameras were clearly visible to all in the courtroom.\n3\n The cameras were equipped with \"electronic sound on camera\" which permitted them to take both film and sound. Upon entering the courtroom the judge told all those with television cameras to go back to the booth; asked the press photographers not to move around any more than necessary; ordered that no flashbulbs or floodlights be used; and again told cameramen that they could not go inside the railing. Defense counsel renewed his motion \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 556]\n\u00a0\n to ban all \"sound equipment . . . still cameras, movie cameras and television; and all radio facilities\" from the courtroom. Witnesses were again called on this issue, but at the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge reaffirmed his prior ruling to permit cameramen in the courtroom. In response to petitioner's argument that his rights under the Constitution of the United States were being violated, the judge remarked that the \"case [was] not being tried under the Federal Constitution.\"\n\n\nNone of the proceedings on October 22 was televised live. Television cameras, however, recorded the day's entire proceedings with sound for later showings. Apparently none of the October 22 proceedings was carried live on radio, although the proceedings were recorded on tape. The still photographers admitted by the court were free to take photographs from outside the railing.\n\n\nOn October 23 the selection of the jury began. Overnight an additional strip had been placed across the television booth so that the opening for the television cameras was reduced, but the cameras and their operators were still quite visible.\n4\n A panel of 86 prospective jurors was ready for the voir dire. The judge excused the jurors from the courtroom and made still another ruling on news coverage at the trial. He ordered the television recording to proceed from that point on without an audio pickup, and, in addition, forbade radio tapes of any further proceedings until all the evidence had been introduced. During the course of the trial the television cameras recorded without sound whatever matters appeared interesting to them for use on later newscasts; radio broadcasts in the form of spot reports were made from a room next to the courtroom. There was no live television or radio coverage until November 7 when the trial judge permitted live coverage of the prosecution's \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 557]\n\u00a0\n arguments to the jury, the return of the jury's verdict and its acceptance by the court. Since the defense objected to being photographed during the summation, the judge prohibited television cameramen or still photographers from taking any pictures of the defense during its argument. But the show went on, and while the defense was speaking the cameras were directed at the judge and the arguments were monitored by audio equipment and relayed to the television audience by an announcer. On November 7 the judge, for the first time, directed news photographers desiring to take pictures to take them only from the back of the room. Up until this time the trial judge's orders merely limited news photographers to the spectator section.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n\nThe decision below affirming petitioner's conviction runs counter to the evolution of Anglo-American criminal procedure over a period of centuries. During that time the criminal trial has developed from a ritual practically devoid of rational justification\n5\n to a fact-finding process, the acknowledged purpose of which is to provide a fair and reliable determination of guilt.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn element of rationality was introduced into the guilt-determining process in England over 600 years ago when a rudimentary trial by jury became \"the principal institution for criminal cases.\"\n7\n Initially members of the jury were expected to make their own examinations of the cases they were to try and come to court already familiar \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 558]\n\u00a0\n with the facts,\n8\n which made it impossible to limit the jury's determination to legally relevant evidence. Gradually, however, the jury was transformed from a panel of witnesses to a panel of triers passing on evidence given by others in the courtroom.\n9\n The next step was to insure the independence of the jury, and this was accomplished by the decision in the case of Edward Bushell, 6 How. St. Tr. 999 (1670), which put an end to the practice of fining or otherwise punishing jury members who failed to reach the decision directed by the court. As the purpose of trial as a vehicle for discovering the truth became clearer, it was recognized that the defendant should have the right to call witnesses and to place them under oath,\n10\n to be informed of the charges against him before the trial,\n11\n and to have counsel assist him with his defense.\n12\n All these protections, and others which could be cited, were part of a development by which \"the administration of criminal justice was set upon a firm and dignified basis.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen the colonists undertook the responsibility of governing themselves, one of their prime concerns was the establishment of trial procedures which would be consistent with the purpose of trial. The Continental Congress passed measures designed to safeguard the right to a fair trial,\n14\n and the various States adopted constitutional provisions \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 559]\n\u00a0\n directed to the same end.\n15\n Eventually the Sixth Amendment incorporated into the Constitution certain provisions dealing with the conduct of trials:\n\n \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"\n\n\n\n Significantly, in the Sixth Amendment the words \"speedy and public\" qualify the term trial and the rest of the Amendment defines specific protections the accused is to have at his trial. Thus, the Sixth Amendment, by its own terms, not only requires that the accused have certain specific rights but also that he enjoy them at a trial - a word with a meaning of its own, see Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 271\n.\n\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment which places limitations on the States' administration of their criminal laws also gives content to the term trial. Whether the Sixth Amendment as a whole applies to the States through the Fourteenth,\n16\n or the Fourteenth Amendment embraces only those portions of the Sixth Amendment that are \"fundamental,\"\n17\n or the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a standard of \"ordered liberty\" apart from the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 560]\n\u00a0\n specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\n18\n it has been recognized that state prosecutions must, at the least, comport with \"the fundamental conception\" of a fair trial.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt has been held on one or another of these theories that the fundamental conception of a fair trial includes many of the specific provisions of the Sixth Amendment, such as the right to have the proceedings open to the public, In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n; the right to notice of specific charges, Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196\n; the right to confrontation. Pointer v. Texas, \n380 \nU.S. 400\n; Douglas v. Alabama, \n380 \nU.S. 415\n; and the right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n. But it also has been agreed that neither the Sixth nor the Fourteenth Amendment is to be read formalistically, for the clear intent of the amendments is that these specific rights be enjoyed at a constitutional trial. In the words of Justice Holmes, even though \"every form [be] preserved,\" the forms may amount to no \"more than an empty shell\" when considered in the context or setting in which they were actually applied.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn cases arising from state prosecutions this Court has acted to prevent the right to a constitutional trial from being reduced to a formality by the intrusion of factors into the trial process that tend to subvert its purpose. The Court recognized in Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331\n, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 561]\n\u00a0\n 334, that the \"orderly operation of courts\" is \"the primary and dominant requirement in the administration of justice.\" And, in Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 90\n-91, it was held that the atmosphere in and around the courtroom might be so hostile as to interfere with the trial process, even though an examination of the record disclosed that all the forms of trial conformed to the requirements of law: the defendant had counsel, the jury members stated they were impartial, the jury was correctly charged, and the evidence was legally sufficient to convict. Moreover, in Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n, a conviction was reversed where extensive pretrial publicity rendered a fair trial unlikely despite the observance of the formal requisites of a legal trial. We commented in that case:\n\n\"No doubt each juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and impartial to petitioner, but the psychological impact requiring such a declaration before one's fellows is often its father.\" Id., at 728.\n\n\n\n To recognize that disorder can convert a trial into a ritual without meaning is not to pay homage to order as an end in itself. Rather, it recognizes that the courtroom in Anglo-American jurisprudence is more than a location with seats for a judge, jury, witnesses, defendant, prosecutor, defense counsel and public observers; the setting that the courtroom provides is itself an important element in the constitutional conception of trial, contributing a dignity essential to \"the integrity of the trial\" process. Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367, 377\n. As MR. JUSTICE BLACK said, in another context: \"The very purpose of a court system is to adjudicate controversies, both criminal and civil, in the calmness and solemnity of the courtroom according to legal procedures.\"\n21\n In light of this fundamental conception of what the term trial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 562]\n\u00a0\n means, this Court has recognized that often, despite widespread, hostile publicity about a case, it is possible to conduct a trial meeting constitutional standards. Significantly, in each of these cases, the basic premise behind the Court's conclusion has been the notion that judicial proceedings can be conducted with dignity and integrity so as to shield the trial process itself from these irrelevant, external factors, rather than to aggravate them as here. Thus, in reversing contempt convictions for out-of-court statements, this Court referred to \"the power of courts to protect themselves from disturbances and disorder in the court room,\" Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 266\n (emphasis added); \"the necessity for fair adjudication, free from interruption of its processes,\" Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331, 336\n; \"the integrity of the trial,\" Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367, 377\n. And, in upholding a conviction against a claim of unfavorable publicity, this Court commented \"that petitioner's trial was conducted in a calm judicial manner,\" Darcy v. Handy, \n351 \nU.S. 454, 463\n.\n\n\nSimilarly, when state procedures have been found to thwart the purpose of trial this Court has declared those procedures to be unconstitutional. In Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, the Court considered a state procedure under which judges were paid for presiding over a case only if the defendant was found guilty and costs assessed against him. An argument was made that the practice should not be condemned broadly, since some judges undoubtedly would not let their judgment be affected by such an arrangement. However, the Court found the procedure so inconsistent with the conception of what a trial should be and so likely to produce prejudice that it declared the practice unconstitutional even though no specific prejudice was shown.\n\n\nIn Lyons v. Oklahoma, \n322 \nU.S. 596\n, this Court stated that if an involuntary confession is introduced into evidence \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 563]\n\u00a0\n at a state trial the conviction must be reversed, even though there is other evidence in the record to justify a verdict of guilty. We explained the rationale behind this judgment in Payne v. Arkansas, \n356 \nU.S. 560, 568\n:\n\n\"[W]here . . . a coerced confession constitutes a part of the evidence before the jury and a general verdict is returned, no one can say what credit and weight the jury gave to the confession.\"\n\n\n\n Similar reasoning led to the decision last Term in Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368\n. We held there that when the voluntariness of a confession is at issue there must be a procedure adopted which provides \"a reliable and clearcut determination of . . . voluntariness.\" Id., at 391. We found insufficient a procedure whereby the jury heard the confession but was instructed to disregard it if the jury found the confession involuntary:\n\n\"[T]he New York procedure poses substantial threats to a defendant's constitutional rights to have an involuntary confession entirely disregarded and to have the coercion issue fairly and reliably determined. These hazards we cannot ignore.\" Id., at 389.\n\n\n\n Earlier this Term, in Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466\n, we considered a case in which deputy sheriffs, who were the prosecution's principal witnesses, were in charge of a sequestered jury during the trial. The Supreme Court of Louisiana criticized the practice but said that in the absence of a showing of prejudice there was no ground for reversal. We reversed because the \"extreme prejudice inherent\" in the practice required its condemnation on constitutional grounds.\n\n\nFinally, the Court has on numerous other occasions reversed convictions, where the formalities of trial were \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 564]\n\u00a0\n observed, because of practices that negate the fundamental conception of trial.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis line of cases does not indicate a disregard for the position of the States in our federal system. Rather, it stands for the proposition that the criminal trial under our Constitution has a clearly defined purpose, to provide a fair and reliable determination of guilt and no procedure or occurrence which seriously threatens to divert it from that purpose can be tolerated.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Constitution to have vitality, this Court must be able to apply its principles to situations that may not have been foreseen at the time those principles were adopted. As was said in Weems v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 349, 373\n, and reaffirmed in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483, 492\n-493:\n\n \"Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from an experience of evils, but its general language should not, therefore, be necessarily confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. . . . In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 565]\n\u00a0\n into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words might be lost in reality.\"\n\n\n\n I believe that it violates the Sixth Amendment for federal courts and the Fourteenth Amendment for state courts to allow criminal trials to be televised to the public at large. I base this conclusion on three grounds: (1) that the televising of trials diverts the trial from its proper purpose in that it has an inevitable impact on all the trial participants; (2) that it gives the public the wrong impression about the purpose of trials, thereby detracting from the dignity of court proceedings and lessening the reliability of trials; and (3) that it singles out certain defendants and subjects them to trials under prejudicial conditions not experienced by others.\n\n\nI have attempted to show that our common-law heritage, our Constitution, and our experience in applying that Constitution have committed us irrevocably to the position that the criminal trial has one well-defined purpose - to provide a fair and reliable determination of guilt. In Tumey v. Ohio, supra, at 532, this Court condemned the procedure there employed for compensating judges because it offered a \"possible temptation\" to judges \"not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.\" How much more harmful is a procedure which not only offers the temptation to judges to use the bench as a vehicle for their own ends, but offers the same temptation to every participant in the trial, be he defense counsel, prosecutor, witness or juror! It is not necessary to speak in the abstract on this point. In the present case, on October 1, the trial judge invited the television cameras into his chambers so they could take films of him reading one of his pretrial orders. On this occasion, at least, the trial judge clearly took the initiative in placing himself before the television audience and in giving his order, and himself, the maximum possible publicity. Moreover, on October 22, when trial counsel renewed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 566]\n\u00a0\n his motion to exclude television from the courtroom on the ground that it violated petitioner's rights under the Federal Constitution, the trial judge made the following speech:\n\n\"This case is not being tried under the Federal Constitution. This Defendant has been brought into this Court under the state laws, under the State Constitution.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"I took an oath to uphold this Constitution, not the Federal Constitution but the State Constitution; and I am going to do my best to do that as long as I preside on this Court, and if it is distasteful in following my oath and upholding the constitution, it will just have to be distasteful.\"\n\n\n\n One is entitled to wonder if such a statement would be made in a court of justice by any state trial judge except as an appeal calculated to gain the favor of his viewing audience. I find it difficult to believe that this trial judge, with over 20 years' experience on the bench, was unfamiliar with the fundamental duty imposed on him by Article VI of the Constitution of the United States:\n\n \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"\n\n\n\n This is not to say that all participants in the trial would distort it by deliberately playing to the television audience, but some undoubtedly would. The even more serious danger is that neither the judge, prosecutor, defense counsel, jurors or witnesses would be able to go \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 567]\n\u00a0\n through trial without considering the effect of their conduct on the viewing public. It is admitted in dissent that \"if the scene at the September hearing had been repeated in the courtroom during this jury trial, it is difficult to conceive how a fair trial in the constitutional sense could have been afforded the defendant.\" Post, p. 612. But it is contended that what went on at the September hearing is irrelevant to the issue before us. With this I cannot agree. We granted certiorari to consider whether petitioner was denied due process when he was required to submit to a televised trial. In this, as in other cases involving rights under the Due Process Clause, we have an obligation to make an independent examination of the record, e. g., Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49, 51\n; Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587, 590\n; and the limited grant of certiorari does not prohibit us from considering all the facts in this record relevant to the question before us. The parties to this case, and those who filed briefs as amici curiae, recognize this, since they treat the televising of the September proceedings as a factor relevant to our consideration. Our decisions in White v. Maryland, \n373 \nU.S. 59\n, and Hamilton v. Alabama, \n368 \nU.S. 52\n, clearly hold that an accused is entitled to procedural protections at pretrial hearings as well as at actual trial and his conviction will be reversed if he is not accorded these protections. In addition, in Pointer v. Texas, \n380 \nU.S. 400\n, we held that a pretrial hearing can have a profound effect on the trial itself and effectively prevent an accused from having a fair trial. Petitioner clearly did not have a fair determination of his motion to exclude cameras from the courtroom. The very presence of the cameras at the September hearing tended to impress upon the trial judge the power of the communications media and the criticism to which he would have been subjected if he had ruled that the presence of the cameras was inconsistent with petitioner's right to a fair trial. The prejudice to petitioner \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 568]\n\u00a0\n did not end here. Most of the trial participants were present at the September hearing - the judge, defense counsel, prosecutor, prosecution witnesses and defendant himself - and they saw for themselves the desecration of the courtroom. After undergoing this experience it is unrealistic to suppose that they would come to the October trial unaware that court procedures were being sacrificed in this case for the convenience of television. The manner in which the October proceedings were conducted only intensified this awareness. It was impossible for any of the trial participants ever to be unaware of the presence of television cameras in court for the actual trial.\n23\n The snouts of the four television cameras protruded through the opening in the booth, and the cameras and their operators were not only readily visible but were impossible to ignore by all who were surveying the activities in this small courtroom. No one could forget that he was constantly in the focus of the \"all-seeing eye.\" Although the law of Texas purportedly permits witnesses to object to being televised, it is ludicrous to place this burden on them. They would naturally accept the conditions of the courtroom as the judge establishes them, and feel that it would be as presumptuous for them to object to the court's permitting television as to object to the court reporter's recording their testimony. Yet, it is argued that no witnesses objected to being televised. This is indeed a slender reed to rely on, particularly in view of the trial judge's failure, in the course of his self-exculpating statements justifying his decision to allow television, to advise the witnesses or the jurors that they had the right to object to being televised. Defense counsel, however, stated forcefully that he could not concentrate on the case because of the distraction caused by the cameras. And the trial judge's attention \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 569]\n\u00a0\n was distracted from the trial since he was compelled to make seven extensive rulings concerning television coverage during the October proceedings alone, when he should, instead, have been concentrating on the trial itself.\n\n\nIt is common knowledge that \"television . . . can . . . work profound changes in the behavior of the people it focuses on.\"\n24\n The present record provides ample support for scholars who have claimed that awareness that a trial is being televised to a vast, but unseen audience, is bound to increase nervousness and tension,\n25\n cause an increased \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 570]\n\u00a0\n concern about appearances,\n26\n and bring to the surface latent opportunism that the traditional dignity of the courtroom would discourage. Whether they do so consciously or subconsciously, all trial participants act differently in the presence of television cameras. And, even if all participants make a conscientious and studied effort to be unaffected by the presence of television, this effort in itself prevents them from giving their full attention to their proper functions at trial. Thus, the evil of televised trials, as demonstrated by this case, lies not in the noise and appearance of the cameras, but in the trial participants' awareness that they are being televised. To the extent that television has such an inevitable impact it undercuts the reliability of the trial process.\n\n\nIn the early days of this country's development, the entertainment a trial might provide often tended to obfuscate its proper role.\n\n \"The people thought holding court one of the greatest performances in the range of their experience. . . . The country folks would crowd in for ten miles to hear these `great lawyers' plead; and it was a secondary matter with the client whether he won or lost his case, so the `pleading' was loud and long.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n \"In early frontier America, when no motion pictures, no television, and no radio provided entertainment, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 571]\n\u00a0\n trial day in the county was like fair day, and from near and far citizens young and old converged on the county seat. The criminal trial was the theater and spectaculum of old rural America. Applause and cat calls were not infrequent. All too easily lawyers and judges became part-time actors at the bar . . . .\"\n28\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n I had thought that these days of frontier justice were long behind us, but the courts below would return the theater to the courtroom.\n\n\nThe televising of trials would cause the public to equate the trial process with the forms of entertainment regularly seen on television and with the commercial objectives of the television industry. In the present case, tapes of the September 24 hearing were run in place of the \"Tonight Show\" by one station and in place of the late night movie by another. Commercials for soft drinks, soups, eyedrops and seatcovers were inserted when there was a pause in the proceedings. In addition, if trials were televised there would be a natural tendency on the part of broadcasters to develop the personalities of the trial participants, so as to give the proceedings more of an element of drama. This tendency was noticeable in the present case. Television commentators gave the viewing audience a homey, flattering sketch about the trial judge, obviously to add an extra element of viewer appeal to the trial:\n\n \"Tomorrow morning at 9:55 the WFAA T. V. cameras will be in Tyler to telecast live [the trial judge's] decision whether or not he will permit live coverage of the Billie Sol Estes trial. If so, this will be the first such famous national criminal proceeding to be televised in its entirety live. [The trial judge] \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 572]\n\u00a0\n was appointed to the bench here in Tyler in 1942 by [the Governor]. The judge has served every two years since then. This very beautiful Smith County Courthouse was built and dedicated in 1954, but before that [the trial judge] had made a reputation for himself that reached not only throughout Texas, but throughout the United States as well. It is said that [the trial judge], who is now 53 years old, has tried more cases than any other judge during his time in office.\"\n\n\n\n The television industry might also decide that the bare-boned trial itself does not contain sufficient drama to sustain an audience. It might provide expert commentary on the proceedings and hire persons with legal backgrounds to anticipate possible trial strategy, as the football expert anticipates plays for his audience. The trial judge himself stated at the September hearing that if he wanted to see a ball game he would turn on his television set, so why not the same for a trial.\n\n\nMoreover, should television become an accepted part of the courtroom, greater sacrifices would be made for the benefit of broadcasters. In the present case construction of a television booth in the courtroom made it necessary to alter the physical layout of the courtroom and to move from their accustomed position two benches reserved for spectators.\n29\n If this can be done in order better to accommodate the television industry, I see no reason why another court might not move a trial to a theater, if such a move would provide improved television coverage. Our memories are short indeed if we have already forgotten the wave of horror that swept over this country when Premier Fidel Castro conducted his prosecutions before 18,000 people in Havana Stadium.\n30\n But in the decision \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 573]\n\u00a0\n below, which completely ignores the importance of the courtroom in the trial process, we have the beginnings of a similar approach toward criminal \"justice.\" This is not an abstract fear I am expressing because this very situation confronted the Nebraska Supreme Court in Roberts v. State, 100 Neb. 199, 203, 158 N. W. 930, 931-932 (1916):\n\n \"The court removed the trial from the court-room to the theater, and stated as a reason therefor: `By reason of the insufficiency of the court-room to seat and accommodate the people applying for admission . . . it is by the court ordered that the further trial of this cause be had at the Keith Theater, and thereupon the court was adjourned to Keith Theater, where trial proceeded.' The stage was occupied by court, counsel, jury, witnesses, and officers connected with the trial. The theater proper was crowded with curious spectators. Before the trial was completed it was returned to the court-room and concluded there. At the adjournment of court on one occasion the bailiff announced from the stage: `The regular show will be tomorrow; matinee in the afternoon and another performance at 8:30. Court is now adjourned until 7:30.'\"\n\n\n\n There would be a real threat to the integrity of the trial process if the television industry and trial judges were allowed to become partners in the staging of criminal proceedings. The trial judge in the case before us had several \"conferences [with] representatives of the news media.\" Post, p. 606. He then entered into a joint enterprise with a television station for the construction of a booth in his courtroom. The next logical step in this partnership might be to schedule the trial for a time that would permit the maximum number of viewers to watch and to schedule recesses to coincide with the need for station breaks. Should the television industry become an \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 574]\n\u00a0\n integral part of our system of criminal justice, it would not be unnatural for the public to attribute the shortcomings of the industry to the trial process itself. The public is aware of the television industry's consuming interest in ratings, and it is also aware of the steps that have been taken in the past to maintain viewer interest in television programs. Memories still recall vividly the scandal caused by the disclosure that quiz programs had been corrupted in order to heighten their dramatic appeal. Can we be sure that similar efforts would not be made to heighten the dramatic appeal of televised trials? Can we be sure that the public would not inherently distrust our system of justice because of its intimate association with a commercial enterprise?\n\n\nBroadcasting in the courtroom would give the television industry an awesome power to condition the public mind either for or against an accused. By showing only those parts of its films or tapes which depict the defendant or his witnesses in an awkward or unattractive position, television directors could give the community, state or country a false and unfavorable impression of the man on trial. Moreover, if the case should end in a mistrial, the showing of selected portions of the trial, or even of the whole trial, would make it almost impossible to select an impartial jury for a second trial. Cf. Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n. To permit this powerful medium to use the trial process itself to influence the opinions of vast numbers of people, before a verdict of guilt or innocence has been rendered, would be entirely foreign to our system of justice.\n\n\nThe sense of fairness, dignity and integrity that all associate with the courtroom would become lost with its commercialization. Thus, the televising of trials would not only have an effect on those participating in the trials that are being televised, but also on those who observe the trials and later become trial participants. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is argued that television not only entertains but also educates the public. But the function of a trial is not to provide an educational experience; and there is a serious danger that any attempt to use a trial as an educational tool will both divert it from its proper purpose and lead to suspicions concerning the integrity of the trial process. The Soviet Union's trial of Francis Gary Powers provides an example in point. The integrity of the trial was suspect because it was concerned not only with determining the guilt of the individual on trial but also with providing an object lesson to the public. This divided effort undercut confidence in the guilt-determining aspect of the procedure and by so doing rendered the educational aspect self-defeating.\n\n\"Was it prejudicial to [Powers] that the trial took place in a special hall with over 2,000 spectators, that it was televised, that prominent representatives of many organizations in various countries were invited to attend, that simultaneous oral translations of the proceedings . . . were provided, and that detailed . . . reports of the case in various languages were distributed to the press before, during and after the trial?\"\n\n\n \". . . [T]he Soviet legal system . . . consciously and explicitly uses the trial, and indeed the very safeguards of justice themselves, as instruments of the social and political objectives of the state. . . .\n\n\n \". . . A Soviet trial is supposed to be correct, impartial, just, reasonable, and at the same time it is supposed to serve as an object-lesson to society, a means of teaching the participants, the spectators and the public generally to be loyal, obedient, disciplined fighters for Communist ideals. . . .\n\n\n \". . . [T]he tension between the demands of justice and the demands of politics can never be entirely \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 576]\n\u00a0\n eliminated. The fate of the accused is bound to be influenced in one way or another when the trial is lifted above its individual facts and deliberately made an object-lesson to the public.\"\n\n\n \". . . [T]he deliberate use of a trial as a means of political education threatens the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Finally, if the televising of criminal proceedings were approved, trials would be selected for television coverage for reasons having nothing to do with the purpose of trial. A trial might be televised because a particular judge has gained the fancy of the public by his unorthodox approach; or because the district attorney has decided to run for another office and it is believed his appearance would attract a large audience; or simply because a particular courtroom has a layout that best accommodates television coverage.\n32\n For the most part, however, the most important factor that would draw television to the courtroom would be the nature of the case. The alleged perpetrator of the sensational murder, the fallen idol, or some other person who, like petitioner, has attracted the public interest would find his trial turned into \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 577]\n\u00a0\n a vehicle for television. Yet, these are the very persons who encounter the greatest difficulty in securing an impartial trial, even without the presence of television. This Court would no longer be able to point to the dignity and calmness of the courtroom as a protection from outside influences. For the television camera penetrates this protection and brings into the courtroom tangible evidence of the widespread interest in a case - an interest which has often been fanned by exhaustive reports in the newspapers, television and radio for weeks before trial. The present case presents a clear example of this danger. In the words of petitioner's counsel:\n\n \"The Saturday Evening Post, The Readers Digest, Time, Life all had feature stories upon [petitioner's] story giving in detail his life history and the details of . . . alleged fraudulent transactions . . . .\n\n\n \"The metropolitan papers throughout the country featured the story daily. Each day for weeks the broadcasts carried some features of the story.\"\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n After living in the glare of this publicity for weeks, petitioner came to court for a legal adjudication of the charges against him. As he approached the courthouse he was confronted by an army of photographers, reporters and television commentators shoving microphones in his face.\n34\n When he finally made his way into the courthouse it was reasonable for him to expect that he could have a respite from this merciless badgering and have his case adjudicated in a calm atmosphere. Instead, the carnival atmosphere of the September hearing served only to increase the publicity surrounding petitioner and to condition further the public's mind against him. Then, upon his entrance into the courtroom for his actual trial he was \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 578]\n\u00a0\n confronted with the sight of the television camera zeroed in on him and the ever-present still photographers snapping pictures of interest. As he opened a newspaper waiting for the proceedings to begin, the close-up lens of a television camera zoomed over his shoulder in an effort to find out what he was reading. In no sense did the dignity and integrity of the trial process shield this petitioner from the prejudicial publicity to which he had been exposed, because that publicity marched right through the courtroom door and made itself at home in heretofore unfamiliar surroundings. We stated in Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335, 344\n, \"From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law.\" This principle was not applied by the courts below.\n\n\nI believe petitioner in this case has shown that he was actually prejudiced by the conduct of these proceedings, but I cannot agree with those who say that a televised trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial only if \"actual prejudice\" can be shown. The prejudice of television may be so subtle that it escapes the ordinary methods of proof,\n35\n but it would gradually erode our fundamental conception of trial.\n36\n A defendant may be unable to prove that he was actually prejudiced by a televised trial, just as he may be unable to prove that the introduction of a coerced confession at his trial influenced the jury to convict him when there was substantial evidence to support his conviction aside from the confession, Payne v. Arkansas, supra; that the jury refrained from making a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 579]\n\u00a0\n clear-cut determination on the voluntariness question, Jackson v. Denno, supra; that a particular judge was swayed by a direct financial interest in his conviction, Tumey v. Ohio, supra; or that the jury gave additional weight to the testimony of certain prosecution witnesses because of the jury's repeated contacts with those witnesses during the trial, Turner v. Louisiana, supra. How is the defendant to prove that the prosecutor acted differently than he ordinarily would have, that defense counsel was more concerned with impressing prospective clients than with the interests of the defendant, that a juror was so concerned with how he appeared on television that his mind continually wandered from the proceedings, that an important defense witness made a bad impression on the jury because he was \"playing\" to the television audience, or that the judge was a little more lenient or a little more strict than he usually might be? And then, how is petitioner to show that this combination of changed attitudes diverted the trial sufficiently from its purpose to deprive him of a fair trial? It is no answer to say that an appellate court can review for itself tapes or films of the proceedings. In the first place, it is not clear that the court would be able to obtain unedited tapes or films to review. Even with the cooperation of counsel on both sides, this Court was unable to obtain films of this trial which were in any sense complete. In addition, time limitations might restrict the television companies to taking pictures only of those portions of the trial that are most newsworthy and most likely to attract the attention of the viewing audience. More importantly, the tapes or films, even if unedited, could give a wrong impression of the proceedings. The camera which takes pictures cannot take a picture of itself. In addition, the camera cannot possibly cover the actions of all trial participants during the trial. While the camera is focused on the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 580]\n\u00a0\n judge who is apparently acting properly, a juror may be glancing up to see where the camera is pointing and counsel may be looking around to see whether he can confer with his client without the close-up lens of the camera focusing on them. Needless to say, the camera cannot penetrate the minds of the trial participants and show their awareness that they may at that moment be the subject of the camera's focus. The most the camera can show is that a formally correct trial took place, but our Constitution requires more than form.\n\n\nI recognize that the television industry has shown in the past that it can be an enlightening and informing institution, but like other institutions it must respect the rights of others and cannot demand that we alter fundamental constitutional conceptions for its benefit. We must take notice of the inherent unfairness of television in the courtroom and rule that its presence is inconsistent with the \"fundamental conception\" of what a trial should be. My conviction that this is the proper holding in this case is buttressed by the almost unanimous condemnation of televised court proceedings by the judiciary in this country and by the strong opposition to the practice by the organized bar in this country. Canon 35 of the American Bar Association's Canons of Judicial Ethics prohibits the televising of court trials.\n37\n With only two, or possibly three exceptions,\n38\n the highest court of each \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 581]\n\u00a0\n State which has considered the question has declared that televised criminal trials are inconsistent with the Anglo-American conception of \"trial.\"\n39\n Similarly, Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibits \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 582]\n\u00a0\n the \"broadcasting\" of trials,\n40\n and the Judicial Conference of the United States has unanimously condemned televised trials.\n41\n This condemnation rests on more than notions of policy; it arises from an understanding of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 583]\n\u00a0\n constitutional conception of the term \"trial.\" Such a general consensus is certainly relevant to this Court's determination of the question. See Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 651\n.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n\nNothing in this opinion is inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of a public trial and the freedoms of speech and the press.\n\n\nThis Court explained in In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 266\n, 270, that the public trial provision of the Sixth Amendment is a \"guarantee to an accused\" designed to \"safeguard against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.\" Clearly the openness of the proceedings provides other benefits as well: it arguably improves the quality of testimony, it may induce unknown witnesses to come forward with relevant testimony, it may move all trial participants to perform their duties conscientiously, and it gives the public the opportunity to observe the courts in the performance of their duties and to determine whether they are performing adequately.\n42\n But the guarantee of a public trial confers no special benefit on the press, the radio industry or the television industry. A public trial is a necessary component of an accused's right to a fair trial and the concept of public trial cannot be used to defend conditions which prevent the trial process from providing a fair and reliable determination of guilt.\n\n\nTo satisfy the constitutional requirement that trials be public it is not necessary to provide facilities large enough \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 584]\n\u00a0\n for all who might like to attend a particular trial, since to do so would interfere with the integrity of the trial process and make the publicity of trial proceedings an end in itself. Nor does the requirement that trials be public mean that observers are free to act as they please in the courtroom, for persons who attend trials cannot act in such a way as to interfere with the trial process, see Moore v. Dempsey, supra. When representatives of the communications media attend trials they have no greater rights than other members of the public. Just as an ordinary citizen might be prohibited from using field glasses or a motion picture camera in the courthouse because by so doing he would interfere with the conduct of the trial, representatives of the press and broadcasting industries are subject to similar limitations when they attend court. Since the televising of criminal trials diverts the trial process from its proper end, it must be prohibited. This prohibition does not conflict with the constitutional guarantee of a public trial, because a trial is public, in the constitutional sense, when a courtroom has facilities for a reasonable number of the public to observe the proceedings, which facilities are not so small as to render the openness negligible and not so large as to distract the trial participants from their proper function, when the public is free to use those facilities, and when all those who attend the trial are free to report what they observed at the proceedings.\n\n\nNor does the exclusion of television cameras from the courtroom in any way impinge upon the freedoms of speech and the press. Court proceedings, as well as other public matters, are proper subjects for press coverage.\n\n\"A trial is a public event. What transpires in the court room is public property. If a transcript of the court proceedings had been published, we suppose \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 585]\n\u00a0\n none would claim that the judge could punish the publisher for contempt. And we can see no difference though the conduct of the attorneys, of the jury, or even of the judge himself, may have reflected on the court. Those who see and hear what transpired can report it with impunity. There is no special perquisite of the judiciary which enables it, as distinguished from other institutions of democratic government, to suppress, edit, or censor events which transpire in proceedings before it.\"\n43\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n So long as the television industry, like the other communications media, is free to send representatives to trials and to report on those trials to its viewers, there is no abridgment of the freedom of press. The right of the communications media to comment on court proceedings does not bring with it the right to inject themselves into the fabric of the trial process to alter the purpose of that process.\n\n\nIn summary, television is one of the great inventions of all time and can perform a large and useful role in society. But the television camera, like other technological innovations, is not entitled to pervade the lives of everyone in disregard of constitutionally protected rights.\n44\n The television industry, like other institutions, has a proper area of activities and limitations beyond which it cannot go with its cameras.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\n\nI concur in the opinion of the Court, subject, however, to the reservations and only to the extent indicated in this opinion.\n\n\nThe constitutional issue presented by this case is far-reaching in its implications for the administration of justice in this country. The precise question is whether the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State, over the objection of a defendant, from employing television in the courtroom to televise contemporaneously, or subsequently by means of videotape, the courtroom proceedings of a criminal trial of widespread public interest. The issue is no narrower than this because petitioner has not asserted any isolatable prejudice resulting from the presence of television apparatus within the courtroom or from the contemporaneous or subsequent broadcasting of the trial proceedings. On the other hand, the issue is no broader, for we are concerned here only with a criminal trial of great notoriety, and not with criminal proceedings of a more or less routine nature.\n\n\nThe question is fraught with unusual difficulties. Permitting television in the courtroom undeniably has mischievous potentialities for intruding upon the detached atmosphere which should always surround the judicial process. Forbidding this innovation, however, would doubtless impinge upon one of the valued attributes of our federalism by preventing the States from pursuing a novel course of procedural experimentation. My conclusion is that there is no constitutional requirement that television be allowed in the courtroom, and, at least as to a notorious criminal trial such as this one, the considerations against allowing television in the courtroom so far outweigh the countervailing factors advanced in its support as to require a holding that what was done in this case infringed the fundamental right to a fair trial assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSome preliminary observations are in order: All would agree, I am sure, that at its worst, television is capable of distorting the trial process so as to deprive it of fundamental fairness. Cables, kleig lights, interviews with the principal participants, commentary on their performances, \"commercials\" at frequent intervals, special wearing apparel and makeup for the trial participants - certainly such things would not conduce to the sound administration of justice by any acceptable standard. But that is not the case before us. We must judge television as we find it in this trial - relatively unobtrusive, with the cameras contained in a booth at the back of the courtroom.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\nNo constitutional provision guarantees a right to televise trials. The \"public trial\" guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, which reflects a concept fundamental to the administration of justice in this Country, In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n, certainly does not require that television be admitted to the courtroom. See United Press Assns. v. Valente, 308 N. Y. 71, 123 N. E. 2d 777. Essentially, the public-trial guarantee embodies a view of human nature, true as a general rule, that judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors will perform their respective functions more responsibly in an open court than in secret proceedings. In re Oliver, supra, at 266-273. A fair trial is the objective, and \"public trial\" is an institutional safeguard for attaining it.\n\n\nThus the right of \"public trial\" is not one belonging to the public, but one belonging to the accused, and inhering in the institutional process by which justice is administered. Obviously, the public-trial guarantee is not violated if an individual member of the public cannot gain admittance to a courtroom because there are no available seats. The guarantee will already have been met, for the \"public\" will be present in the form of those persons \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 589]\n\u00a0\n who did gain admission. Even the actual presence of the public is not guaranteed. A public trial implies only that the court must be open to those who wish to come, sit in the available seats, conduct themselves with decorum, and observe the trial process. It does not give anyone a concomitant right to photograph, record, broadcast, or otherwise transmit the trial proceedings to those members of the public not present, although to be sure, the guarantee of public trial does not of itself prohibit such activity.\n\n\nThe free speech and press guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments are also asserted as embodying a positive right to televise trials, but the argument is greatly overdrawn. Unquestionably, television has become a very effective medium for transmitting news. Many trials are newsworthy, and televising them might well provide the most accurate and comprehensive means of conveying their content to the public. Furthermore, television is capable of performing an educational function by acquainting the public with the judicial process in action. Albeit these are credible policy arguments in favor of television, they are not arguments of constitutional proportions. The rights to print and speak, over television as elsewhere, do not embody an independent right to bring the mechanical facilities of the broadcasting and printing industries into the courtroom. Once beyond the confines of the courthouse, a news-gathering agency may publicize, within wide limits, what its representatives have heard and seen in the courtroom. But the line is drawn at the courthouse door; and within, a reporter's constitutional rights are no greater than those of any other member of the public. Within the courthouse the only relevant constitutional consideration is that the accused be accorded a fair trial. If the presence of television substantially detracts from that goal, due process requires that its use be forbidden. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 590]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI see no force in the argument that to exclude television apparatus from the courtroom, while at the same time permitting newspaper reporters to bring in their pencils and notebooks, would discriminate in favor of the press as against the broadcasting services. The distinctions to be drawn between the accouterments of the press and the television media turn not on differences of size and shape but of function and effect. The presence of the press at trials may have a distorting effect, but it is not caused by their pencils and notebooks. If it were, I would not hesitate to say that such physical paraphernalia should be barred.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n\nThe probable impact of courtroom television on the fairness of a trial may vary according to the particular kind of case involved. The impact of television on a trial exciting wide popular interest may be one thing; the impact on a run-of-the-mill case may be quite another. Furthermore, the propriety of closed circuit television for the purpose of making a court recording or for limited use in educational institutions obviously presents markedly different considerations. The Estes trial was a heavily publicized and highly sensational affair. I therefore put aside all other types of cases; in so doing, however, I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am by no means prepared to say that the constitutional issue should ultimately turn upon the nature of the particular case involved. When the issue of television in a non-notorious trial is presented it may appear that no workable distinction can be drawn based on the type of case involved, or that the possibilities for prejudice, though less severe, are nonetheless of constitutional proportions. Compare Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n; Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n; Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n. The resolution of those further questions should await an appropriate case; the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 591]\n\u00a0\n Court should proceed only step by step in this unplowed field. The opinion of the Court necessarily goes no farther, for only the four members of the majority who unreservedly join the Court's opinion would resolve those questions now.\n\n\nI do not deem the constitutional inquiry in this case ended by the finding, in effect conceded by petitioner's counsel, that no isolatable prejudice was occasioned by the manner in which television was employed in this case.\n1\n Courtroom television introduces into the conduct of a criminal trial the element of professional \"showmanship,\" an extraneous influence whose subtle capacities for serious mischief in a case of this sort will not be underestimated by any lawyer experienced in the elusive imponderables of the trial arena. In the context of a trial of intense public interest, there is certainly a strong possibility that the timid or reluctant witness, for whom a court appearance even at its traditional best is a harrowing affair, will become more timid or reluctant when he finds that he will also be appearing before a \"hidden audience\" of unknown but large dimensions. There is certainly a strong possibility that the \"cocky\" witness having a thirst for the limelight will become more \"cocky\" under the influence of television. And who can say that the juror who is gratified by having been chosen for a front-line case, an ambitious prosecutor, a publicity-minded defense counsel, and even a conscientious judge will not stray, albeit unconsciously, from doing what \"comes naturally\" into pluming themselves for a satisfactory television \"performance\"? \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSurely possibilities of this kind carry grave potentialities for distorting the integrity of the judicial process bearing on the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused, and, more particularly, for casting doubt on the reliability of the fact-finding process carried on under such conditions. See Douglas. The Public Trial and the Free Press, 46 A. B. A. J. 840 (1960). To be sure, such distortions may produce no telltale signs, but in a highly publicized trial the danger of their presence is substantial, and their effects may be far more pervasive and deleterious than the physical disruptions which all concede would vitiate a conviction. A lively public interest could increase the size of the viewing audience immensely, and the masses of spectators to whom the trial is telecast would have become emotionally involved with the case through the dissemination of pretrial publicity, the usual concomitant of such a case. The presence of television would certainly emphasize to the trial participants that the case is something \"special.\" Particularly treacherous situations are presented in cases where pretrial publicity has been massive\n2\n even when jurors positively state they will not be influenced by it; see Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n; Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n. To increase the possibility of influence and the danger of a \"popular verdict\" by subjecting the jurors to the view of a mass audience whose approach to the case has been conditioned by pretrial publicity can only make a bad situation worse. The entire thrust of rules of evidence and the other protections attendant upon the modern trial is to keep extraneous influences out of the courtroom. Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466, 472\n-473. As we recently observed in Turner, \"Mr. Justice Holmes stated no more than a truism when he observed that `Any judge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms they \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 593]\n\u00a0\n are extremely likely to be impregnated by the environing atmosphere.' Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309\n, at 349 (dissenting opinion).\" Id., at 472.\n3\n The knowledge on the part of the jury and other trial participants that they are being televised to an emotionally involved audience can only aggravate the atmosphere created by pretrial publicity.\n\n\nThe State argues that specific prejudice must be shown for the Due Process Clause to apply. I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment is so impotent when the trial practices in question are instinct with dangers to constitutional guarantees. I am at a loss to understand how the Fourteenth Amendment can be thought not to encompass protection of a state criminal trial from the dangers created by the intrusion of collateral and wholly irrelevant influences into the courtroom. The Court has not hesitated in the past to condemn such practices, even without any positive showing of isolatable prejudice. In Turner v. Louisiana, supra, decided just this Term, we held that the \"potentialities\" for distortion of the trial created by a key witness serving as bailiff to a sequestered jury were sufficient to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368\n, the Court made the judgment that a trial judge's determination of a coerced-confession issue is more likely to avoid prejudice than a jury determination, a judgment which indeed overrode a long-standing contrary state practice. And in Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n, we held that flamboyant pretrial publicity cast sufficient doubt on the impartiality of the jury to vitiate a conviction, even in the face of statements by all the jurors that they were not subject to its influence. See \n366 \nU.S., at 729\n (Frankfurter. J., concurring). Other examples of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 594]\n\u00a0\n instances in which the Court has exercised its judgment as to the effects of one thing or another on human behavior are plentiful. See, e. g., Griffin v. California, \n380 \nU.S. 609\n; Tancil v. Woolls, \n379 \nU.S. 19\n; Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n (compare People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N. E. 585); Avery v. Georgia, \n345 \nU.S. 559\n; Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n.\n\n\nThe judgment that the presence of television in the courtroom represents a serious danger to the trial process is supported by a vast segment of the Bar of this country, as evidenced by Canon 35 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association, counselling against such practices,\n4\n the views of the Judicial Conference of the United States (infra, p. 601), Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and even the \"personal views\" (post, pp. 601-602) of the Justices on the dissenting side of the present case.\n\n\nThe arguments advanced against the constitutional banning of televised trials seem to me peculiarly unpersuasive. It is said that the pictorial broadcasting of trials will serve to educate the public as to the nature of the judicial process. Whatever force such arguments might have in run-of-the-mill cases, they carry little weight in cases of the sort before us, where the public's interest in viewing the trial is likely to be engendered more by curiosity about the personality of the well-known figure who is the defendant (as here), or about famous witnesses or lawyers who will appear on the television screen, or about the details of the particular crime involved, than by innate curiosity to learn about the workings of the judicial process itself. Indeed it would be naive not to suppose that it would be largely such factors that would qualify a trial for commercial television \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 595]\n\u00a0\n \"billing,\" and it is precisely that kind of case where the risks of permitting television coverage of the proceedings are at their greatest.\n\n\nIt is also asserted that televised trials will cause witnesses to be more truthful, and jurors, judges, and lawyers more diligent. To say the least this argument is sophistic, for it is impossible to believe that the reliability of a trial as a method of finding facts and determining guilt or innocence increases in relation to the size of the crowd which is watching it. Attendance by interested spectators in the courtroom will fully satisfy the safeguards of \"public trial.\" Once openness is thus assured, the addition of masses of spectators would, I venture to say, detract rather than add to the reliability of the process. See Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 562\n. A trial in Yankee Stadium, even if the crowd sat in stony silence, would be a substantially different affair from a trial in a traditional courtroom under traditional conditions, and the difference would not. I think, be that the witnesses, lawyers, judges, and jurors in the stadium would be more truthful, diligent, and capable of reliably finding facts and determining guilt or innocence.\n5\n There will be no disagreement, I am sure, among those competent to judge that precisely the opposite would likely be the case.\n\n\nFinally, we should not be deterred from making the constitutional judgment which this case demands by the prospect that the day may come when television will have become so commonplace an affair in the daily life of the average person as to dissipate all reasonable likelihood that its use in courtrooms may disparage the judicial process. If and when that day arrives the constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 596]\n\u00a0\n judgment called for now would of course be subject to re-examination in accordance with the traditional workings of the Due Process Clause. At the present juncture I can only conclude that televised trials, at least in cases like this one, possess such capabilities for interfering with the even course of the judicial process that they are constitutionally banned. On these premises I concur in the opinion of the Court.\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE    HARLAN, CONCURRING.\n\n\n\n The development of Canon 35 is set out at length in the amicus curiae brief of the American Bar Association, pp. 3-8, as follows:\n\n\"It [Canon 35] was originally adopted on September 30, 1937 by the House of Delegates\n1a\n in the following form:\n\n \"`Proceedings in court should be conducted with fitting dignity and decorum. The taking of photographs in the court room, during sessions of the court or recesses between sessions, and the broadcasting of court proceedings are calculated to detract from the essential dignity of the proceedings, degrade the court and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public and should not be permitted.' 62 A. B. A. REP. 1134-35 (1937).\n\n\n\n\"A Special Committee on Cooperation Between Press, Radio and Bar, as to Publicity Interfering with Fair Trial of Judicial and Quasi-Judicial Proceedings had reported to the Association its grave concern with the dangers attendant upon the use of radio in connection with trials, particularly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 597]\n\u00a0\n in light of the spectacular publicity and broadcast of the trial of Bruno Hauptmann.\n2a\n The Committee specifically referred to the evil of `trial in the air'.\n3a\n 62 A. B. A. REP. 860 (1937).\n\n\n\"After the adoption of Judicial Canon 35, the direct radio broadcasting of court proceedings was disapproved by the Association's Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances in its Opinion No. 212, March 15, 1941, as being specifically condemned. The Committee quoted with approval the following statement of the Michigan and Detroit Bar Associations:\n\n \"`Such broadcasts are unfair to the defendant and to the witnesses. The natural embarrassment and confusion of a citizen on trial should not be increased by a realization that his voice and his difficulties are being used as entertainment for a vast radio audience. The fear expressed by most persons when facing an audience or microphone is a matter of common knowledge, and but few defendants or witnesses can properly concentrate on facts and testify fully and fairly when so handicapped. . . . Such broadcasts are unfair to the Judge, who should be permitted to devote his undivided attention to the case, unmindful of the effect which his comments or decision may \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 598]\n\u00a0\n have upon the radio audience.' AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, OPINIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND GRIEVANCES 426 (1957).\n\n\n\n\"In 1952, the growing prominence of television as a medium of mass communication was dealt with in a report of the Special Committee on Televising and Broadcasting Legislative and Judicial Proceedings [headed by the late John W. Davis]. 77 A. B. A. REP. 607 (1952). In condemning the practice of televising judicial proceedings, the Committee called attention to the fact that:\n\n\"`The attention of the court, the jury, lawyers and witnesses should be concentrated upon the trial itself and ought not to be divided with the television or broadcast audience who for the most part have merely the interest of curiosity in the proceedings. It is not difficult to conceive that all participants may become over-concerned with the impression their actions, rulings or testimony will make on the absent multitude.' Id. at 610.\n\n\n\n\"As a result of this report, and the recommendation of the Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances, Judicial Canon 35 was amended by inserting a ban on the `televising' of court proceedings and inserting the descriptive phrase `distract the witness in giving his testimony' before the phrase `degrade the court.' In addition, a second paragraph was added providing for the televising and broadcasting of certain ceremonial proceedings. Id. at 110-11.\n\n\n\"In October, 1954, the Board of Governors authorized the appointment of a Special Bar-Media Conference Committee on Fair Trial-Free Press to meet with representatives of the press, radio, and television. The views of both sides were thoroughly explored and were presented in detail in the September, 1956 issue of the American Bar Association Journal.\n4a\n After extensive joint debate, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 599]\n\u00a0\n no solutions or agreements were reached. 83 A. B. A. REP. 790-91 (1958). The Committee did report that it was convinced that\n\n\"`courtroom photographing or broadcasting or both would impose undue police duties upon the trial judge[,] . . . that the broadcasting and the photographing in the courtroom might have an adverse psychological effect upon trial participants, judges, lawyers, witnesses and juries[,] . . . [and] that partial broadcasts of trials, particularly on television, might influence public opinion which in turn might influence trial results. . . .' Id. at 645.\n\n\n\n\"Following the presentation of the Bar-Media Conference Committee report and in connection with the consideration of a report and recommendation of a Special Committee of the American Bar Foundation created in July, 1955 (83 A. B. A. REP. 643-45 (1958)), the House of Delegates conducted a hearing as a `Committee of the Whole' during its February, 1958 session at which proponents and opponents of Judicial Canon 35 were fully heard. 83 A. B. A. REP. 648-69 (1958). Thereafter, at the August, 1958 meeting of the House of Delegates, it was decided to have a Special Committee study Canon 35 and\n\n\"`conduct further studies of the problem, including the obtaining of a body of reliable factual data on the experience of judges and lawyers in those courts where either photography, televising or broadcasting, or all of them, are permitted. . . . The fundamental objective of the Committee and of all others interested must be to consider and make recommendations which will preserve the right of fair trial.' 83 A. B. A. REP. 284 (1958).\n\n\n\n\"The Special Committee filed an Interim Report and Recommendations with the House of Delegates in August, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 600]\n\u00a0\n 1962 setting forth the `Area and Perspective' of its survey and studies. The report included portions of testimony by media representatives taken at a hearing held in Chicago on February 18, 1962, as well as a summary of the Committee's informal conference with certain representatives from Colorado and Texas. In addition, the report included written comments by officers of State Bar Associations responding to a Committee survey, and certain general correspondence received by the Committee regarding Judicial Canon 35. The report also listed significant publications favoring either revision or retention of the Canon. . . . [Hereinafter cited Int.

The Committee did recommend certain minor deletions . . . and changes . . . which were adopted by the House of Delegates, after full debate, on February 5, 1963:\n\n\"`The taking of photographs in the court room, during sessions of the court or recesses between sessions, and the broadcasting or televising of court proceedings [are calculated to] detract from the essential dignity of the proceedings, distract [the] participants and witnesses in giving [his] testimony, [degrade the court] and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public and should not be permitted.'\n5a\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 601]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\"A vast majority of the states have voluntarily adopted Judicial Canon 35 in one form or another, and it has been embodied in principle in Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

The witnesses, however, were present at the September hearing when everything was broadcast, and the record does not show affirmatively that they were aware that the microphone which confronted them during the actual trial was not being used for the same purpose.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner in this case amassed 11 volumes of pretrial press clippings.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court had occasion to recognize in Cox v.

However, the critical element is the knowledge of the trial participants that they are subject to such visual observation, an element which is, of course, present in this case.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\nI cannot agree with the Court's decision that the circumstances of this trial led to a denial of the petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment rights. I think that the introduction of television into a courtroom is, at least in the present state of the art, an extremely unwise policy. It invites many constitutional risks, and it detracts from the inherent dignity of a courtroom. But I am unable to escalate this personal view into a per se constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 602]\n\u00a0\n rule. And I am unable to find, on the specific record of this case, that the circumstances attending the limited televising of the petitioner's trial resulted in the denial of any right guaranteed to him by the United States Constitution.\n\n\nOn October 22, 1962, the petitioner went to trial in the Seventh Judicial District Court of Smith County, Texas, upon an indictment charging him with the offenses of (1) swindling, (2) theft by false pretenses, and (3) theft by a bailee. After a week spent in selecting a jury, the trial itself lasted some three and a half days. At its conclusion the jury found the petitioner guilty of the offense of swindling under the first count of the indictment. The trial judge permitted portions of the trial proceedings to be televised, under the limitations described below. He also gave news photographers permission to take still pictures in the courtroom under specified conditions.\n\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the petitioner's conviction, and we granted certiorari, limited to a single question. The question, as phrased by the petitioner, is this:\n\n \"Whether the action of the trial court, over petitioner's continued objection, denied him due process of law and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in requiring petitioner to submit to live television of his trial, and in refusing to adopt in this all out publicity case, as a rule of trial procedure, Canon 35 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association, and instead adopting and following, over defendant's objection, Canon 28 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics, since approved by the Judicial Section of the integrated (State agency) State Bar of Texas.\"\n\n\n\n The two Canons of Judicial Ethics referred to in the petitioner's statement of the question presented are set \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 603]\n\u00a0\n out in the margin.\n1\n But, as the Court rightly says, the problem before us is not one of choosing between the conflicting guidelines reflected in these Canons of Judicial Ethics. It is a problem rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We deal here with matters subject to continuous and unforeseeable change - the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 604]\n\u00a0\n techniques of public communication. In an area where all the variables may be modified tomorrow, I cannot at this time rest my determination on hypothetical possibilities not present in the record of this case. There is no claim here based upon any right guaranteed by the First Amendment. But it is important to remember that we move in an area touching the realm of free communication, and for that reason, if for no other, I would be wary of imposing any per se rule which, in the light of future technology, might serve to stifle or abridge true First Amendment rights.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n\nThe indictment was originally returned by a grand jury in Reeves County, Texas, and it engendered widespread publicity. After some preliminary proceedings there, the case was transferred for trial to Smith County, more than 500 miles away. The trial was set for September 24, 1962, but it did not commence on that date. Instead, that day and the next were spent in hearings on two motions filed by defense counsel: a motion to bar television and news cameras from the trial, and a motion to continue the trial to a later date. Those proceedings were themselves telecast \"live,\" and news photographers were permitted to take pictures in the courtroom. The activities of the television crews and news photographers led to considerable disruption of the hearings.\n2\n At the conclusion \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 605]\n\u00a0\n of the hearings the motion for a continuance was granted, and the case reset for trial on October 22. The motion to bar television and news photographers from the trial was denied.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 606]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn October 1, the trial judge issued an order delineating what coverage he would permit during the trial.\n4\n As a result of the order and ensuing conferences between the judge and representatives of the news media, the environment for the trial, which began on October 22, was in sharp contrast to that of the September hearings. The actual extent of television and news photography in the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 607]\n\u00a0\n courtroom was described by the judge, after the trial had ended, in certifying the petitioner's bill of exceptions. This description is confirmed by my understanding of the entire record and was agreed to and accepted by defense counsel:\n\n \"Prior to the trial of October 22, 1962, there was a booth constructed and placed in the rear of the courtroom painted the same or near the same color as the courtroom with a small opening across the top for the use of cameras . . . .\n\n\n \"Live telecasting and radio broadcasting were not permitted and the only telecasting was on film without sound, and there was not any broadcasting of the trial by radio permitted. Each network, ABC, NBC, CBS and KRLD [KLTV] Television in Tyler was allowed a camera in the courtroom . . . . The telecasting on film of this case was not a continuous camera operation and only pictures being taken at intervals during the day to be used on their regular news casts later in the day. There were some days during the trial that the cameras of only one or two stations were in operation, the other not being in attendance upon the Court each and every day. The Court did not permit any cameras other than those that were noiseless nor were flood lights and flash bulbs allowed to be used in the courtroom. The Court permitted one news photographer with \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 608]\n\u00a0\n Associated Press, United Press International and Tyler Morning Telegraph and Courier Times. However, they were not permitted inside the Bar; and the Court did not permit any telecasting or photographing in the hallways leading into the courtroom or on the second floor of the courthouse where the courtroom is situated, in order that the Defendant and his attorneys would not be hindered, molested or harassed in approaching or leaving the courtroom. The Court did permit live telecasting of the arguments of State's counsel and the returning of the verdict by the Jury and its acceptance by the Court. The opening argument of the District Attorney of Smith County was carried by sound and because of transmission difficulty, there was not any picture. The closing argument for the State by the District Attorney of Reeves County was carried live by both picture and sound. The arguments of attorneys for Defendant, John D. Cofer and Hume Cofer, were not telecast or broadcast as the Court granted their Motion that same not be permitted.\n\n\n \"There was not any televising at any time during the trial except from the booth in the rear of the courtroom, and during the argument of counsel to the jury, news photography was required to operate from the booth so that they would not interfere or detract from the attention of either the jurors or the attorneys.\n\n\n \"During the trial that began October 22nd, there was never at any time any radio broadcasting equipment in the courtroom. There was some equipment in a room off of the courtroom where there were periodic news reports given; and throughout the trial that began October 22nd, not any witness requested not to be televised or photographed while they were testifying. Neither did any juror, while being interrogated \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 609]\n\u00a0\n on voir dire or at any other time, make any request of the Court not to be televised.\"\n\n\n\n Thus, except for the closing arguments for the prosecution and the return of the jury's verdict, there was no \"live\" telecasting of the trial. And, even for purposes of delayed telecasting on later news programs, no words or other sounds were permitted to be recorded while the members of the jury were being selected or while any witness was testifying. No witnesses and no jurors were televised or photographed over their objection.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the members of the jury saw no telecasts and no pictures of anything that went on during the trial. In accord with Texas law, the jurors were sequestered, day and night, from the beginning of the trial until it ended.\n6\n The jurors were lodged each night in quarters provided for that purpose in the courthouse itself. On the evening of November 6, by agreement of counsel and special permission of the court, the members of the jury were permitted to watch the election returns on television for a short period. For this purpose a portable television was brought into the jury's quarters by a court officer, and operated by him. Otherwise the jurors were not permitted to watch television at any time during the trial. The only newspapers permitted the jury were ones from which all coverage of the trial had been physically removed.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to bear in mind the precise limits of the question before us in this case. The petition for a writ of certiorari asked us to review four separate constitutional claims. We declined to review three of them, among which was the claim that the members of the jury \"had received through the news media damaging and prejudicial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 610]\n\u00a0\n evidence . . . .\"\n7\n We thus left undisturbed the determination of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that the members of the jury were not prejudiced by the widespread publicity which preceded the petitioner's trial. One ingredient of this pretrial publicity was the telecast of the September hearings. Despite the confusion in the courtroom during those hearings, all that a potential juror could have possibly learned from watching them on television was that the petitioner's case had been called for trial, and that motions had been made and acted upon for a continuance, and to exclude cameras and television. At those hearings, there was no discussion whatever of anything bearing on the petitioner's guilt or innocence. This was conceded by the petitioner's counsel at the trial.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of our refusal to review the petitioner's claim that pretrial publicity had a prejudicial effect upon the jurors in this case, and because, insofar as the September hearings were an element of that publicity, the claim is patently without merit, that issue is simply not here. Our decision in Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n, therefore, has no bearing at all in this case. There the record showed that the inhabitants of the small Louisiana parish where the trial was held had repeatedly been exposed to a television film showing \"Rideau, in jail, flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and murder, in response to leading questions by the sheriff.\" 373 U.S., \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 611]\n\u00a0\n at 725. We found that \"[a]ny subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality.\" Id., at 726. See also Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n.\n\n\nThe Rideau case was no more than a contemporary application of enduring principles of procedural due process, principles reflected in such earlier cases as Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n; Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n; and Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 235\n-241. \"Under our Constitution's guarantee of due process,\" we said, \"a person accused of committing a crime is vouchsafed basic minimal rights. Among these are the right to counsel, the right to plead not guilty, and the right to be tried in a courtroom presided over by a judge.\" \n373 \nU.S., at 726\n-727. We had occasion to apply the same basic concepts of procedural due process earlier this Term in Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466\n. \"In the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the `evidence developed' against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant's right of confrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel.\" \n379 \nU.S., at 472\n-473.\n\n\nBut we do not deal here with mob domination of a courtroom, with a kangaroo trial, with a prejudiced judge or a jury inflamed with bias. Under the limited grant of certiorari in this case, the sole question before us is an entirely different one. It concerns only the regulated presence of television and still photography at the trial itself, which began on October 22, 1962. Any discussion of pretrial events can do no more than obscure the important question which is actually before us.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n\nIt is obvious that the introduction of television and news cameras into a criminal trial invites many serious constitutional hazards. The very presence of photographers \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 612]\n\u00a0\n and television cameramen plying their trade in a courtroom might be so completely and thoroughly disruptive and distracting as to make a fair trial impossible. Thus, if the scene at the September hearing had been repeated in the courtroom during this jury trial, it is difficult to conceive how a fair trial in the constitutional sense could have been afforded the defendant.\n9\n And even if, as was true here, the television cameras are so controlled and concealed as to be hardly perceptible in the courtroom itself, there are risks of constitutional dimensions that lurk in the very process of televising court proceedings at all.\n\n\nSome of those risks are catalogued in the amicus curiae brief filed in this case by the American Bar Association: \"[P]otential or actual jurors, in the absence of enforceable and effective safeguards, may arrive at certain misconceptions regarding the defendant and his trial by viewing televised pre-trial hearings and motions from which the jury is ordinarily excluded. Evidence otherwise inadmissible may leave an indelible mark. . . . Once the trial begins, exposure to nightly rebroadcasts of selected portions of the day's proceedings will be difficult to guard against, as jurors spend frequent evenings before the television set. The obvious impact of witnessing repeated trial episodes and hearing accompanying commentary, episodes admittedly chosen for their news value and not for evidentiary purposes, can serve only to distort the jurors' perspective. . . . Despite the court's injunction not to discuss the case, it seems undeniable that jurors will be subject to the pressure of television-watching family, friends and, indeed, strangers. . . . It is not too much to imagine a juror being confronted with his wife's television-oriented viewpoint. . . . Additionally, the jurors' daily television appearances may make them recognizable celebrities, likely to be stopped by passing \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 613]\n\u00a0\n strangers, or perhaps harried by intruding telephone calls. . . .\" Constitutional problems of another kind might arise if a witness or juror were subjected to being televised over his objection.\n\n\nThe plain fact of the matter, however, is that none of these things happened or could have happened in this case. The jurors themselves were prevented from seeing any telecasts of the trial, and completely insulated from association with any members of the public who did see such telecasts. This case, therefore, does not remotely resemble Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466\n, where, during the trial, the jurors were subjected outside the courtroom to unmeasured and unmeasurable influences by key witnesses for the prosecution.\n\n\nIn the courtroom itself, there is nothing to show that the trial proceeded in any way other than it would have proceeded if cameras and television had not been present. In appearance, the courtroom was practically unaltered. There was no obtrusiveness and no distraction, no noise and no special lighting. There is no indication anywhere in the record of any disturbance whatever of the judicial proceedings. There is no claim that the conduct of the judge, or that any deed or word of counsel, or of any witness, or of any juror, was influenced in any way by the presence of photographers or by television.\n\n\nFurthermore, from a reading of the record it is crystal clear that this was not a trial where the judge was harassed or confused or lacking in command of the proceedings before the jury. Not once, after the first witness was called, was there any interruption at all of the trial proper to secure a ruling concerning the presence of cameramen in the courtroom. There was no occasion, during the entire trial - until after the jury adjourned to reach its verdict - for any cautionary word to members of the press in the courtroom. The only time a motion was made, the jury was not in the courtroom. The trial itself was a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 614]\n\u00a0\n most mundane affair, totally lacking in the lurid and completely emotionless. The evidence related solely to the circumstances in which various documents had been signed and negotiated. It was highly technical, if not downright dull. The petitioner called no witnesses, and counsel for petitioner made only a brief closing argument to the jury. There is nothing to indicate that the issues involved were of the kind where emotion could hold sway. The transcript of the trial belies any notion that frequent interruptions and inconsistent rulings communicated to the jury any sense that the judge was unable to concentrate on protecting the defendant and conducting the trial in a fair manner, in accordance with the State and Federal Constitutions.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n\nWhat ultimately emerges from this record, therefore, is one bald question - whether the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits all television cameras from a state courtroom whenever a criminal trial is in progress. In the light of this record and what we now know about the impact of television on a criminal trial, I can find no such prohibition in the Fourteenth Amendment or in any other provision of the Constitution. If what occurred did not deprive the petitioner of his constitutional right to a fair trial, then the fact that the public could view the proceeding on television has no constitutional significance. The Constitution does not make us arbiters of the image that a televised state criminal trial projects to the public.\n\n\nWhile no First Amendment claim is made in this case, there are intimations in the opinions filed by my Brethren in the majority which strike me as disturbingly alien to the First and Fourteenth Amendments' guarantees against federal or state interference with the free communication of information and ideas. The suggestion that there are limits upon the public's right to know what goes on in \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 615]\n\u00a0\n the courts causes me deep concern. The idea of imposing upon any medium of communications the burden of justifying its presence is contrary to where I had always thought the presumption must lie in the area of First Amendment freedoms. See Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 525\n. And the proposition that nonparticipants in a trial might get the \"wrong impression\" from unfettered reporting and commentary contains an invitation to censorship which I cannot accept. Where there is no disruption of the \"essential requirement of the fair and orderly administration of justice,\" \"[f]reedom of discussion should be given the widest range.\" Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331, 347\n; Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n. Cf. Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 563\n.\n\n\nI do not think that the Constitution denies to the State or to individual trial judges all discretion to conduct criminal trials with television cameras present, no matter how unobtrusive the cameras may be. I cannot say at this time that it is impossible to have a constitutional trial whenever any part of the proceedings is televised or recorded on television film. I cannot now hold that the Constitution absolutely bars television cameras from every criminal courtroom, even if they have no impact upon the jury, no effect upon any witness, and no influence upon the conduct of the judge.\n\n\nFor these reasons I would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Canons of Judicial Ethics.

Improper Publicizing of Court Proceedings.\n\n\"Proceedings in court should be conducted with fitting dignity and decorum. The taking of photographs in the court room, during sessions of the court or recesses between sessions, and the broadcasting or televising of court proceedings unless properly supervised and controlled, may detract from the essential dignity of the proceedings, distract participants and witnesses in giving testimony, and create misconceptions with respect thereto in the mind of the public.

Two television cameras had been set up inside the bar and four more marked cameras were aligned just outside the gates.\n\n\n\"A microphone stuck its 12-inch snout inside the jury box, now occupied by an overflow of reporters from the press table, and three microphones confronted Judge Dunagan on his bench. [C]ables and wires snaked over the floor.\" The New York Times, September 25, 1962, p. 46, col. 4.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In ruling on the motion, the trial judge stated:\n\n\"In the past, it has been the policy of this Court to permit televising in the court room under the rules and supervision of the Court. Heretofore, I have not encountered any difficulty with it. I was unable to observe any detraction from the witnesses or the attorneys in those cases. We have watched television, of course, grow up from its infancy and now into its maturity; and it is a news media. So I really do not see any justified reason why it should not be permitted to take its proper seat in the family circle. However, it will be under the strict supervision of the Court. I know there has been pro and con about televising in the court room. I have heard some say that it makes a circus out of the Court. I had the privilege yesterday morning of sitting in my home and viewing a sermon by the First Baptist Church over in Dallas and certainly it wasn't any circus in that church; and I feel that if it is a proper instrument in the house of the Lord, it is not out of place in the court room, if properly supervised.\n\n\n\"Now, television is going to be televising whatever the scene is here. If you want to watch a ball game and that is what they televise, you are going to see a ball game. If you want to see a preacher and hear a sermon, you tune in on that and that is what you are going to get. If the Court permits a circus in this court room, it will be televised, that is true, but they will not be creating a circus.\n\n\n\"Now, the most important point is whether or not it would interfere with a fair and impartial trial of this Defendant. That is the most important point, and that is the purpose, or will be the primary purpose of the Court, to insure that he gets that fair trial.\n\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\"There is not anything the Court can do about the interest in this case, but I can control your activities and your conduct here; and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 606]\n\u00a0\n I can assure you now that this Court is not going to be turned into a circus with TV or without it. Whatever action is necessary for the Court to take to insure that, the Court will take it.\n\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\"There has been one consideration that the Court has given and it is that this is a small court room and there will be hundreds of people trying to get into this court room to witness this trial. I believe we would have less confusion if they would stay at home and stay out of the court room and look in on the trial. With all of those people trying to crowd in and push into this court room, that is another consideration I have given to it.\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"In my statement of September 24, 1962, admitting television and other cameras in the court room during the trial of Billie Sol Estes, I said cameras would be allowed under the control and direction of the Court so long as they did not violate the legal rights of the Defendant or the State of Texas.\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"In line with my statement of September 24, 1962, I am at this time informing both television and radio that live broadcasting or telecasting by either news media cannot and will not be permitted during the interrogation of jurors in testing their qualifications, or of the testimony given by the witnesses, as to do so would be in violation of Art. 644 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Texas, which provides as follows: At the request of either party, the witnesses on both sides may be sworn and placed in the custody of an officer and removed out of the court room to some place where they can not hear the testimony as delivered by any other witness in the case. This is termed placing witnesses under rule.'\n\n\n\". . .

JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\nI agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART that a finding of constitutional prejudice on this record entails erecting a flat ban on the use of cameras in the courtroom and believe that it is premature to promulgate such a broad constitutional principle at the present time. This is the first case in this Court dealing with the subject of television \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 616]\n\u00a0\n coverage of criminal trials; our cases dealing with analogous subjects are not really controlling, cf. Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n; and there is, on the whole, a very limited amount of experience in this country with television coverage of trials. In my view, the currently available materials assessing the effect of cameras in the courtroom are too sparse and fragmentary to constitute the basis for a constitutional judgment permanently barring any and all forms of television coverage. As was said in another context, \"we know too little of the actual impact . . . to reach a conclusion on the bare bones of the . . . evidence before us.\" White Motor Co. v. United States, \n372 \nU.S. 253, 261\n. It may well be, however, that as further experience and informed judgment do become available, the use of cameras in the courtroom, as in this trial, will prove to pose such a serious hazard to a defendant's rights that a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment will be found without a showing on the record of specific demonstrable prejudice to the defendant. Compare Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n, with Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n; Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, with Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n; Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156\n, with Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368, 389\n-390.\n\n\nThe opinion of the Court in effect precludes further opportunity for intelligent assessment of the probable hazards imposed by the use of cameras at criminal trials. Serious threats to constitutional rights in some instances justify a prophylactic rule dispensing with the necessity of showing specific prejudice in a particular case. Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723, 727\n; Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368, 389\n. But these are instances in which there has been ample experience on which to base an informed judgment. Here, although our experience is inadequate and our judgment correspondingly infirm, the Court discourages further meaningful study of the use of television at criminal trials. Accordingly, I dissent. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 617]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\n\nI write merely to emphasize that only four of the five Justices voting to reverse rest on the proposition that televised criminal trials are constitutionally infirm, whatever the circumstances. Although the opinion announced by my Brother CLARK purports to be an \"opinion of the Court,\" my Brother HARLAN subscribes to a significantly less sweeping proposition. He states:\n\n\"The Estes trial was a heavily publicized and highly sensational affair. I therefore put aside all other types of cases . . . . The resolution of those further questions should await an appropriate case; the Court should proceed only step by step in this unplowed field. The opinion of the Court necessarily goes no farther, for only the four members of the majority who unreservedly join the Court's opinion would resolve those questions now.\" Ante, pp. 590-591. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n Thus today's decision is not a blanket constitutional prohibition against the televising of state criminal trials.\n\n\nWhile I join the dissents of my Brothers STEWART and WHITE, I do so on the understanding that their use of the expressions \"the Court's opinion\" or \"the opinion of the Court\" refers only to those views of our four Brethren which my Brother HARLAN explicitly states he shares. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 532, 618]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAIRFAX FAMILY FUND, INC. v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nAppellant is a Kentucky corporation engaged in a mailorder loan business in thirty-two States. It has no offices, no agents, no employees, and no property in California. It solicits loans from California residents by mail; after a credit report is prepared by a local independent contractor, the loan application is passed on by appellant's officers in Kentucky. If the loan is approved, the check is mailed to the borrower from Kentucky. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Because appellant failed to obtain a license from the State of California and pay the annual $200 fee, appellee sought and obtained an injunction barring appellant from conducting its out-of-state small-loan business until the requisite California license was obtained. In order to obtain a license, the lender must display \"the financial responsibility, experience, character, and general fitness . . . such as to command the confidence of the community and to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly, fairly, and efficiently . . . .\" Cal. Fin. Code 24206.\n\nOur decisions have heretofore precluded a State from exacting a license of a firm doing an exclusively interstate business as a condition of entry into the State. See, e. g., Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489\n; Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47\n; Eli Lilly & Co. v. Sav-On-Drugs, \n366 \nU.S. 276, 278\n-289; see also id., at 288, 289-292 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting). Appellee would characterize these California statutes as primarily of a regulatory nature, invoking Robertson v. California, \n328 \nU.S. 440\n, in which the majority of the Court held that a State might exclude an interstate insurance company which failed to meet certain minimum reserve requirements designed to assure that the insurer is financially solvent.\n\nBut here California exacts a $200 annual fee as a condition of obtaining and maintaining a license. As we recognized in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 112\n: \"The power to tax the exercise of a privilege is the power to control or suppress its enjoyment.\" The California District Court of Appeal viewed the fee as one designed to offset the expenses of administering the licensing system itself. From California's characterization of the fee\n*\n it is not one to \"defray the cost of purely \n\n[382 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n local regulations\" which we indicated was permissible in Murdock, \n319 \nU.S., at 114\n, n. 8.

SCHREIBER(1965)\nNo. 482\nArgued: April 27, 1965Decided: May 24, 1965\n\n\n\n\n To secure comprehensive information about various practices in the television industry, the Federal Communications Commission initiated an investigatory proceeding pursuant to 403 of the Communications Act. The Presiding Officer, assigned to conduct the proceeding, was authorized by the Commission to subpoena witnesses and to compel the production of any records or documents deemed relevant. The proceedings were to be public unless the Presiding Officer found that \"the public interest, the proper dispatch of the business . . . or the ends of justice\" would be served by nonpublic sessions. The Presiding Officer issued a subpoena duces tecum directing respondent Schreiber, an executive of respondent Music Corporation of America, Inc. (MCA), to produce lists of network programs which MCA had produced (Annex A to subpoena) or packaged (Annex B). Respondent Schreiber produced the material called for in Annex A, but, claiming that public disclosure of the Annex B information might reveal trade secrets and confidential data, refused to produce said information unless assured that it would be received and held in confidence. The Presiding Officer rejected the demand. The full Commission upheld the Presiding Officer and reaffirmed its resolve to permit nonpublic sessions only in extraordinary situations where it was shown that irreparable damage to private competitive interests outweighed the public interest in disclosure. The Commission noted that the Presiding Officer had acted consistently with that standard and held that respondents' claim of likely competitive injury was unsupported by the pleadings and contrary to the record. Upon remand, the Presiding Officer rejected respondents' broadened claim for confidential treatment of all information to be elicited from them, but respondent Schreiber persisted in his refusal to comply with the Commission's orders and subpoena. The District Court granted the Commission's petition for enforcement, but \"to preclude disclosure of trade secrets of which [MCA's] competitors might take advantage\" ordered that the material be received and held in confidence. The court's order further provided \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 280]\n\u00a0\n that after the investigation of respondents had been completed, the Commission could move the court, upon good cause, for an order permitting such testimony and documents to be made public. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the District Court had not abused its discretion in conditioning the enforcement of the Commission's subpoena and orders. Held:\n\n 1. Under the broad delegation of procedural rule-making authority in 4 (j) of the Communications Act, which authorizes the Commission to \"conduct its proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice,\" the Commission was empowered to promulgate the procedural rule requiring public proceedings except where the proponents of a request for in camera treatment have demonstrated the need therefor. Pp. 289-294.\n\n\n 2. In providing for judicial review of administrative rule-making, Congress has not empowered district courts to substitute their judgment for that of the agency; instead, judicial responsibility is limited to insuring consistency with governing statutes and the demands of the Constitution. Pp. 290-291.\n\n\n 3. The Commission did not abuse its discretion in applying its procedural rule and in rejecting respondents' requests for confidential treatment of all material to be elicited in the future, pp. 295-298, and for confidential treatment of the Annex B information, pp. 298-300.\n\n\n 329 F.2d 517, modified and remanded.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Douglas argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Nathan Lewin, Sherman L. Cohn, Harvey L. Zuckman and Henry Geller.\n\nAllen E. Susman argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Jeffrey L. Nagin and Harry M. Plotkin.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAt issue in this case are the extent of the Federal Communications Commission's authority to promulgate procedural standards for determining whether testimony \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 281]\n\u00a0\n taken and documents produced during an investigatory proceeding should be accorded confidential treatment, and the scope of judicial review of determinations made pursuant to such standards.\n\nThis case had its origin in a subpoena and various orders issued during the course of an investigatory proceeding conducted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 48 Stat. 1094, 47 U.S.C. 403 (1958 ed.).\n1\n The proceeding, financed by specific congressional appropriation,\n2\n was initiated on February 26, 1959, and had as its objective the gathering of\n\n\"comprehensive information concerning the respective roles played by the networks, advertisers, agencies, talent, film producers and distributors, and other major elements in the television industry.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n As an initial step in the investigation, the Commission ordered that an\n\n\"inquiry be made to determine the policies and practices pursued by the networks and others in the acquisition, ownership, production, distribution, selection, sale and licensing of programs for television exhibition, and the reasons and necessity in the public interest for said policies and practices . . . .\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Commission authorized its chief hearing examiner to conduct the investigation. He was empowered, inter alia, to subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 283]\n\u00a0\n and require the production of any records or documents deemed relevant to the inquiry.\n5\n The Commission ordered that\n\n\"said investigatory proceeding shall be a public proceeding except that the said presiding officer may order non-public sessions of the said investigatory proceeding where and to the extent that the public interest, the proper dispatch of the business of said proceeding, or the ends of justice will be served thereby.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n In October 1960, public sessions were held in Los Angeles, California, at which time evidence was received concerning the functions, policies and practices of television companies, talent agencies and representatives, program \"packagers,\"\n7\n sales representatives, and others. On October 17, 1960, the Presiding Officer issued a subpoena duces tecum to respondent Schreiber, a Vice President of respondent Music Corporation of America, Inc. (MCA) - one of the largest packagers and producers of network television programs,\n8\n directing him to appear at \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 284]\n\u00a0\n the hearing and to produce certain documents described in the annexes to the subpoena. Respondent Schreiber appeared and produced the material specified in Annex A.\n9\n He refused, however, to submit without qualification the material called for in Annex B,\n10\n which included a list of the programs packaged by MCA. Respondent Schreiber stated that he would produce the subpoenaed materials only \"if the Commission will take this information and assure us that it will be held in confidence, will not be published, and will not be made available to other people, other than those on the Commission, and that serve the Commission.\" As grounds for confidential treatment, he asserted that the information sought might disclose trade secrets and confidential data, and that the information was outside the scope of the hearing. He \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 285]\n\u00a0\n also objected generally to the procedures governing the hearing on the ground that they would require \"public disclosure of trade secrets and confidential data of my company which might be of aid to its many competitors in this highly competitive television industry.\" The Presiding Officer found \"no doubt\" as to the relevance of the material and rejected, as \"without merit,\" the claim that the information should be received in confidence.\n\nRespondents then petitioned the Commission for review. On January 25, 1961, the Commission affirmed the Presiding Officer and ordered respondents to appear, testify and produce the material subpoenaed at a reconvened hearing. In its opinion the Commission stressed the importance of publicizing the information gathered during the course of the investigation\n11\n and reaffirmed its resolve to permit in camera sessions only in extraordinary situations:\n\n\"[W]e determined that public proceedings should be the rule herein, and that non-public procedures should be used only in those extraordinary instances where disclosure would irreparably damage private, competitive interests and where such interests could be found by the Presiding Officer to outweigh the paramount interest of the public and the Commission in full public disclosure.\"\n\n\n The Commission noted that the Presiding Officer and Commission counsel had made \"every effort to avoid public disclosure of detailed internal financial information or detailed contractual arrangements which might in fact irreparably harm private interests without sufficient compensating benefit to the public,\" and found that they had not departed from this standard in rejecting respondents' claim of likely competitive harm which, the Commission held, was \"totally unsupported by their pleadings and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 286]\n\u00a0\n contrary to the record.\" Accordingly, the Commission ordered respondents \"to testify . . . regarding all matters deemed relevant by said Presiding Officer,\" and to produce the information required by the subpoena and \"such other information and data as may be deemed relevant and ordered or directed to be produced by the said Presiding Officer.\" On remand, a broader claim for confidentiality was made by respondents. They requested that all testimony and documentary evidence to be elicited from them be received in nonpublic sessions, and disclosed only if a court, in subsequent litigation, should authorize its public disclosure. The contention was rejected by the Presiding Officer, but respondent Schreiber persisted in his refusal to comply with the subpoena and the Commission's orders.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commission thereupon petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for the enforcement of its subpoena and orders. The District Court found that the investigation was statutorily authorized, that the information requested in Annex B was relevant to the inquiry, and that respondents had disobeyed valid orders and a valid subpoena.\n13\n Accordingly, the District Court ordered respondents to appear at a reconvened hearing and to comply with the Commission's subpoena and orders. However, the court, in order to protect \"respondents' rights and to preclude disclosure of trade secrets of which competitors might \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 287]\n\u00a0\n take advantage,\" ordered that all testimony given and documents produced by respondents be received and held in confidence.\n14\n The court's order further provided that, after the investigation of respondents had been completed, the Commission could move the court for an order, \"should good cause exist therefor,\" permitting such testimony and documents to be made public. 201 F. Supp. 421.\n\nOn appeal, a divided Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed that portion of the District Court's order which pertains to the questions now before this Court.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 288]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in conditioning its order to require confidential treatment of the information sought. 329 F.2d 517. In dissent, Judge Browning stated that the Commission's procedural rule, requiring public hearings unless in camera proceedings could be justified by those from whom the information was sought, was well within the Commission's power. It was Judge Browning's view that the District Court could require confidential treatment only if the Commission's application of its procedural rule and consequent refusal to accord confidential treatment were found to be arbitrary or an abuse of the Commission's discretion. Id., at 528-534. Because this case presents important questions concerning the respective roles to be performed by federal courts and the Federal Communications Commission in the administration of the Communications Act of 1934, we granted certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 927\n.\n\nWe hold that the Commission's rule - requiring public disclosure except where the proponents of a request for confidential treatment have demonstrated that the public interest, proper dispatch of business, or the ends of justice would be served by nonpublic sessions - was well within the Commission's statutory authority. We further find that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in applying this rule. Accordingly, we modify the decision below insofar as it affirms the District Court's imposition of conditions upon the enforcement of the subpoena and orders issued by the Commission. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSection 4 (j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 48 Stat. 1068, 47 U.S.C. 154 (j) (1958 ed.), empowers the Federal Communications Commission to \"conduct its proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.\" This Court has interpreted that provision as \"explicitly and by implication\" delegating to the Commission power to resolve \"subordinate questions of procedure . . . [such as] the scope of the inquiry, whether applications should be heard contemporaneously or successively, whether parties should be allowed to intervene in one another's proceedings, and similar questions.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 138\n. The statute does not merely confer power to promulgate rules generally applicable to all Commission proceedings, cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. WJR, \n337 \nU.S. 265, 282\n; it also delegates broad discretion to prescribe rules for specific investigations, cf. Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 321\n-322, and to make ad hoc procedural rulings in specific instances, Federal Communications Comm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., supra. Congress has \"left largely to its judgment the determination of the manner of conducting its business which would most fairly and reasonably accommodate\" the proper dispatch of its business and the ends of justice. Federal Communications Comm'n v. WJR, supra.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 290]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the Pottsville Broadcasting case, this Court stressed, in upholding this delegation of broad procedural authority, the established principle that administrative agencies \"should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.\" \n309 \nU.S., at 143\n. This principle, which has been upheld in a variety of applications,\n17\n is an outgrowth of the congressional determination that administrative agencies and administrators will be familiar with the industries which they regulate and will be in a better position than federal courts or Congress itself to design procedural rules adapted to the peculiarities of the industry and the tasks of the agency involved. Thus, underlying the broad delegation in 4 (j) of procedural rule-making power to the Federal Communications Commission is a \"recognition of the rapidly fluctuating factors characteristic of the evolution of broadcasting and of the corresponding requirement that the administrative process possess sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to these factors.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., supra, at 138.\n\nTo permit federal district courts to establish administrative procedures de novo would, of course, render nugatory Congress' effort to insure that administrative procedures be designed by those most familiar with the regulatory problems involved. Thus, in providing for judicial review of administrative procedural rule-making, Congress has not empowered district courts to substitute \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 291]\n\u00a0\n their judgment for that of the agency. Instead, it has limited judicial responsibility to insuring consistency with governing statutes and the demands of the Constitution. Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, \n327 \nU.S. 186, 214\n-218; Federal Communications Comm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., supra, at 144-145; Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 276\n-277.\n\nIt is apparent that the courts below did not respect this congressional distribution of authority. The Commission promulgated a rule governing disclosure in this investigation. Yet, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals inquired into the validity of the Commission's exercise of its rule-making authority. Instead, the District Court devised procedures to be followed by the Commission on the basis of the court's conception of how the public and private interests involved could best be served. In reviewing this determination, the Court of Appeals found that the District Judge had not abused his discretion, \"but, on the contrary, established a fair and just procedure whereby a most important investigation could proceed without being unduly disrupted, obstructed or prolonged, and at the same time afford [respondents] protection against the improvident disclosure of possible valuable trade secrets.\" 329 F.2d, at 524. In so doing, the Court of Appeals erred. The question for decision was whether the exercise of discretion by the Commission was within permissible limits, not whether the District Judge's substituted judgment was reasonable.\n\nIt is also evident that the Commission's procedural rule - requiring public proceedings except where it is shown that the public interest, the dispatch of business, or the ends of justice would be served by nonpublic sessions - was well within the Commission's power. Grants of agency authority comparable in scope to 4 (j) have \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 292]\n\u00a0\n been held to authorize public disclosure of information,\n18\n or receipt of data in confidence,\n19\n as the agency may determine to be proper upon a balancing of the public and private interests involved. That 4 (j) is broad enough to empower the Commission to establish standards for determining whether to conduct an investigation publicly or in private is demonstrated by this Court's decision in Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294\n. There, the Court pointed out that a similar grant of rule-making authority - 315 (c) of the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 941, 942-943 - which authorizes the Tariff Commission \"to adopt such reasonable procedure, rules, and regulations as it may deem necessary,\" empowered the Commission\n\n\"to shape its course within reasonable limits by its own conception of the promptings of policy and fairness. It would have kept within the statute even though it had made the hearings private and had refrained from the publication of anything, either the records of its agents or the testimony of witnesses. . . . Instead, it made the hearing public, and exposed everything to view except only when publication was likely in its judgment to result in hardship or injustice.\" \n288 \nU.S., at 321\n-322.\n\n\n The delegated power, of course, may not be exercised arbitrarily, but its exercise may not be impeached merely because reasonable minds might differ on the wisdom thereof. Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, \n327 \nU.S. 186, 215\n-218; Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 139, 146\n; Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, supra, at 321-322. It is apparent, however, that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 293]\n\u00a0\n the Commission's determination in the present case that \"public proceedings should be the rule\" with exceptions granted \"only in those extraordinary instances where disclosure would irreparably damage private, competitive interests and where such interests could be found by the Presiding Officer to outweigh the paramount interest of the public and the Commission in full public disclosure\" was not an arbitrary exercise of the Commission's authority. The procedural rule, establishing a presumption in favor of public proceedings, accords with the general policy favoring disclosure of administrative agency proceedings.\n20\n Moreover, the reasons advanced by the Commission in support of its determination to make public hearings the norm and to place the burden of justifying confidential treatment upon those from whom information is sought amply demonstrate that the Commission's exercise of its delegated powers may not be successfully attacked as arbitrary or capricious. The investigative inquiry was designed to secure information to aid the Commission in the discharge of its many functions. The Commission stated that the subject matter of the inquiry is \"complex and generally unknown\" involving \"many-sided transaction[s]\" among \"networks, advertising \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 294]\n\u00a0\n agencies, program producers, program packagers, talent agencies\" and others. Therefore, the Commission determined, in order \"to obtain a full and rounded picture of such transactions, it is highly desirable that the facts, information, data and opinion supplied by one group or individual be known to other groups and individuals involved, so that they may verify, refute, explain, amplify or supplement the record from their own diverse points of view.\" The Commission observed that, in addition to stimulating the flow of information, public hearings serve to inform those segments of the public primarily affected by the agency's regulatory policies and those likely to be affected by subsequent administrative or legislative action of the factual basis for any action ultimately taken - a practical inducement to public acceptance of the results of the investigation.\n21\n Also implicit in the Commission's discourse is a recognition that publicity tends to stimulate the flow of information and public preferences which may significantly influence administrative and legislative views as to the necessity and character of prospective action. The Commission further pointed out that public disclosure is necessary to the execution of its duty under 4 (k) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 48 Stat. 1068, 47 U.S.C. 154 (k) (1958 ed.), to make annual reports to Congress. Significantly, this investigation was specifically authorized by Congress so that Congress might \"draw upon the facts which are obtained.\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the Commission's adoption of the procedural rule favoring public disclosure and placing upon those from whom information is sought the burden of demonstrating the need for in camera proceedings is statutorily authorized. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 295]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nRemaining for determination is whether the Commission's application of its disclosure rule and the consequent rejection of respondents' requests for confidential treatment were so arbitrary or unreasonable as to warrant the imposition by the District Court of conditions upon enforcement of the Commission's subpoena and orders.\n23\n\u00a0\n\nUpon remand from the Commission, respondents moved that all testimony and documents to be elicited from them - not merely Annex B - should be received in camera. Respondents asserted that in light of the announced scope of the inquiry, the Commission's order to produce documents upon request and to testify \"regarding all matters deemed relevant\" would require MCA \"to disclose all of its business information to its many competitors and to make a public record of all of its activities,\" and that such a disclosure, if demanded, would necessarily include confidential business secrets. No factual showing was made; there was only the argument.\n\nThe District Court accepted the argument, finding \"well-grounded [the] fears of the respondents that the testimony to be given might result in disclosure of trade-secrets, of which competitors might take advantage.\" 201 F. Supp., at 425. Accordingly, the court ordered that all testimony and documents adduced by respondents be received in confidence. In so doing the District Court erred, for it is clear that the Presiding Officer did not abuse his discretion in rejecting this request for blanket nondisclosure.\n\nThe Presiding Officer did not know what information would actually be sought, what questions asked. Indeed, he could only speculate as to whether the Commission would seek to elicit any data which, if disclosed to MCA's \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 296]\n\u00a0\n competitors, would work competitive harm. He could not ascertain the likelihood of irreparable damage to private competitive interests, nor could he discern whether the private interest outweighed the public interest in disclosure. If and when information was demanded which if disclosed might in fact injure MCA competitively, there would be ample opportunity to request that it be received in confidence, and to seek judicial protection if the request were denied. Cf. Reisman v. Caplin, \n375 \nU.S. 440\n. The Presiding Officer would have abused his discretion in denying the request only if it were shown that no information could have been elicited from respondents which could be publicly disclosed. The record affords no justification for such a proposition.\n\nThe only other possible basis for the District Court's order would be an assumption that the Presiding Officer would consistently require disclosure even if a balancing of public and private interests compelled secrecy. There is no support for such an assumption in the record and it runs contrary to the presumption to which administrative agencies are entitled - that they will act properly and according to law.\n\nNor can the District Court's order be saved on the ground that it did not direct that all information be held in confidence, but merely deferred the determination of whether the information was entitled to confidential treatment until after the inquiry of respondents had been completed. The order directs that there be no disclosure until the court so orders, \"should good cause exist therefor.\" Not only does this order seem to shift the burden of proof to the Commission to justify publication, despite the valid rule to the contrary, but it also permits respondents to avoid submitting the issue of disclosure to the Presiding Officer despite the \"long settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 297]\n\u00a0\n administrative remedy has been exhausted.\" Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41, 50\n-51; Reisman v. Caplin, supra. Moreover, the District Court's order forbids disclosure until completion of the investigation of respondents without any showing that secrecy is justified. During this period the Commission could not make the information available to Congress, and the Commission would be denied the benefit of other evidence stimulated by disclosure. And the period during which the benefits of disclosure would be denied would inevitably be long. Respondent first appeared before the Presiding Officer on October 21, 1960, and resolution of the issues then raised has caused a delay of more than four and one-half years.\n\nWe do not find forceful respondents' contention that the District Court's order was necessary to protect against the discriminatory treatment of MCA by the Commission. The allegation finds little support in the record; moreover, no reference is made to this factor in the District Court's opinion or findings of fact. Respondents' assertions that \"the Commission's interest in MCA was deep\" and that \"concentration upon MCA was unique,\" even if true, would not demonstrate the need for secrecy. Instead, such assertions merely lend credence to the Commission's unchallenged finding that because of the importance of MCA in the industry, the failure to explore fully the policies and practices of MCA \"would seriously impair, if not render nugatory, any attempt on the Commission's part to understand and delineate the policies, practices and activities involved in the creation, production, sale and licensing of television filmed programs.\" Furthermore, it is clear that respondents are adequately protected against improvident disclosure, even if the Commission should unfairly seek disclosure of information which would be competitively disastrous to respondents. Not only does the administrative remedy exist, but judicial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 298]\n\u00a0\n protection against Commission overreaching also remains available with respect to any requests for information made in the future.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in rejecting respondents' requests for blanket nondisclosure and accordingly hold that the District Court erred in ordering the Commission to afford confidential treatment to all information elicited from respondents.\n\nRespondents also moved that confidential treatment be accorded Annex B which called for the production of a list of programs as to which MCA served as a \"packager\" and those in which MCA had a financial interest. Respondent Schreiber testified that the information sought would disclose MCA's confidential agency relationships with clients, \"might be used detrimentally,\" and \"would be possibly advantageous to our competitors.\"\n\nWe find that the Commission's affirmance of the Presiding Officer's determination that the material sought in Annex B should be received in public session was clearly proper. Certainly private agreements between MCA and its clients not to disclose facts without the client's consent could not affect the Commission in the discharge of its public duties. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence 2286 (McNaughton rev. 1961). And the naked assertion of possible competitive injury does not establish that the Presiding Officer abused his discretion in declining to accord confidential treatment. Moreover, there is nothing in the District Court's opinion, findings or conclusions of law which indicates the likelihood, or even the possibility, of competitive harm from public disclosure of the Annex B information. MCA's competitors and others engaged in similar businesses had furnished publicly the same type of information without objection. Respondents did not attempt before the Commission or on review to distinguish the information furnished by MCA's competitors or the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 299]\n\u00a0\n list of programs produced by MCA (subpoenaed in Annex A) which was introduced without objection by respondent Schreiber. Nor did respondents file affidavits in support of their position. But, even if it were conceded that disclosure of Annex B might have some competitive impact, there is no warrant for concluding that the Presiding Officer abused his discretion in finding that respondents had not sustained their burden of demonstrating that the private interest involved outweighed the public interest in disclosure.\n\nOne further point should be discussed. During oral argument counsel for respondents suggested that his clients were prejudiced in their efforts to demonstrate the need for confidential treatment of the information contained in Annex B by restrictions imposed upon the participation of counsel by the then-prevailing Commission rules.\n24\n We do not find this contention persuasive. Respondents filed a petition, prepared and signed by counsel, seeking review before the full Commission of the Presiding Officer's rejection of their confidentiality request. Subsequently, they filed a second motion for confidential treatment with the Presiding Officer and respondents' counsel was afforded an opportunity to argue orally in support of the motion. Thus, it is evident that the then-existing Commission rules restricting the rights of counsel did not prejudice respondents in their efforts to secure in camera proceedings with regard to Annex B,\n25\n and hence \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 300]\n\u00a0\n there is no occasion to order that respondents be afforded an additional opportunity to present objections to the disclosure of the information subpoenaed in Annex B.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is modified so as to strike paragraph 2 of the District Court's order, and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to enforce the Commission's orders and subpoena without qualification.\n\n   It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 403 provides:\n\n\"The Commission shall have full authority and power at any time to institute an inquiry, on its own motion, in any case and as to any matter or thing concerning which complaint is authorized to be made, to or before the Commission by any provision of this Act, or concerning which any question may arise under any of the provisions of this Act, or relating to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act. The Commission shall have the same powers and authority to proceed with any inquiry instituted on its own motion as though it had been appealed to by complaint or petition under any of the provisions of this Act, including the power to make and enforce any order or orders in the case, or relating to the matter or thing concerning which the inquiry is had, excepting orders for the payment of money.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Independent Offices Appropriations Act, 1956, 69 Stat. 199, 201-202.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Statement of Commission Chairman McConnaughey; Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Independent Offices Appropriations for 1956, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 293.

The record of the proceeding to date clearly establishes that failure fully to explore the policies, practices and activities of MCA, Inc., in connection with television programming would seriously impair, if not render nugatory, any attempt on the Commission's part to understand and delineate the policies, practices and activities involved in the creation, production, sale and licensing of television filmed programs . . . .\" R. 16.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \"(A) A list by name or title of all television programs whether series programs, special programs, or otherwise, which appeared or were exhibited by or through the facilities of the television networks operated by NBC, CBS, or ABC since September 1, 1958, which programs were produced by MCA, Inc. or Revue Productions, Inc. and\/or in which MCA, Inc. or Revue Productions, Inc. has or had a financial or proprietary interest or with regard to which MCA, Inc. or Revue Productions, Inc. is or was entitled to receive or has received a percentage of the profits or other compensation or fees in connection with the production or exhibition of such programs other than remuneration or compensation for the representation as agent of individual natural persons as talent.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"(B) A list of all television programs whether series programs, special programs, or otherwise, which appeared on or were exhibited by or through the facilities of the television networks of NBC, CBS, or ABC, since September 1, 1958, in which MCA, Inc. or any predecessor affiliate or subsidiary of MCA, Inc. acted as packager and\/or, by agreement or otherwise, is entitled to receive or has received a percentage of the cost or selling price of said program or was or is entitled to receive or has received other compensation, remuneration or fees in connection with the packaging, licensing for broadcast or selling of said program, otherwise than as remuneration or compensation for the representation as agent of individual natural persons as talent.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See infra, pp. 293-294.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] On review of the Presiding Officer's first order, the Commission, although dealing with the merits of that order, held \"that the orders and directions of the Presiding Officer as to relevance and public disclosure of evidence, information and data are interlocutory in nature, do not of themselves `aggrieve' any person, and are not, as of right, appealable to the Commission.\" This holding precluded an application to the Commission for review of the Presiding Officer's second order.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Respondents do not challenge these findings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Paragraph 2 of the District Court's order provides:\n\n\"It is Further Ordered that any further interrogation of respondents and any documents produced by respondents be taken and held by the Commission in private and confidential session, that the public be excluded therefrom, that all testimony adduced and documents produced be maintained in confidence by the Commission, that the Commission by motion duly made and served, may move the Court upon the conclusion of such interrogation and production for an order, should good cause exist therefor, permitting such testimony and documents to be made public, and that respondents shall retain the right to oppose such motion if and when so made.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Under the procedures established by the Presiding Officer, counsel for a witness could not, during the course of interrogation of his client, take exception to, request clarification of, or object to any question, nor could he initiate consultation with his client. Counsel could consult with his client only upon the request of the client if approved by the Presiding Officer. The District Court held that under 6 (a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 240, respondents were entitled to the assistance of counsel in the following respects: the right to have counsel object to any question and state his reasons therefor, and the right to have counsel initiate consultation without interference by the Commission or its agents. The Court of Appeals disagreed, concluding that the procedures established by the Presiding Officer were not violative of any constitutional or statutory provisions. On Sept. 2, 1964, the Commission amended Part I of its Rules and Regulations, permitting counsel for any person compelled to appear in Commission proceedings to advise his client either upon his own initiative or that of his client, \"to make objections on the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 279, 288]\n\u00a0\n record, and to state briefly the basis for such objections.\" 29 Fed. Reg. 12774-12775. Finding this amendment to be \"in accord with respondents' legal position on this matter,\" respondents did not seek review of the ruling below. Given the change in the Commission's rules, we need not, and do not, express any views as to the legality of the prior rules concerning a witness' right to the assistance of counsel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Commission's own conception of its authority is similarly broad.

After several postponements of the date set by the District Court for reporting progress \"in complying with the mandate of the Supreme Court,\" the parties presented a proposed interlocutory decree providing for submission of a detailed divestiture plan in six months. The District Court thereupon held appellant bank and its officers in contempt for failure to comply with this Court's mandate.

First National Bank, \n376 \nU.S. 665\n, this Court held that the merger of First National Bank and Trust Co. of Lexington, Kentucky, with Security Trust Co. of Lexington to form First Security National Bank and Trust Co. violated 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1. The Court's judgment remanded the case to the District Court \"for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court.\" Thereafter, on July 1, 1964, the District Court ordered the parties \"to report to the court the progress made in complying with the judgment\" of the Supreme Court. On application of the parties, the reporting date was thrice postponed to permit negotiations between First Security and the Government concerning an appropriate \n\n[382 \nU.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n plan of divestiture. When, on the final date for reporting, February 16, 1965, the parties jointly presented only a proposed interlocutory decree providing that the detailed plan for divestiture would be submitted within six months, the District Court held First Security, its executive officers and directors in contempt. Although there is some indication that the District Court was dissatisfied with the compliance of the bank with the District Court's order of July 1, 1964, the contempt judgment itself was entered because the delay in submitting a final plan of divestiture was a failure \"to comply with the mandate of the Supreme Court . . . .\" The court imposed a fine of $100 per day until the contempt had been purged by \"full compliance with the mandate of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe District Judge's interpretation of this Court's judgment was erroneous. We remanded the case for further proceedings in the District Court consistent with this Court's opinion. Neither the opinion nor the judgment of this Court expressly dealt with the matter of remedy and neither ordered divestiture within any particular period of time. Compare United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., \n376 \nU.S. 651, 662\n (decided the same day as the prior appeal in this case and directing the District Court to order divestiture without delay). No order of divestiture was entered in the District Court until March 18, 1965, a month after the bank had been held in contempt. The District Court has the authority to require obedience and to punish disobedience of its lawful orders and decrees, 18 U.S.C. 401, but this record reveals nothing the bank did or failed to do which violated the judgment of this Court.

DORSEY(1965)\nNo. 178\nArgued: December 10, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Under Georgia's 1962 Senatorial Reapportionment Act the State is divided into senatorial districts that are conceded to be substantially equal in population. Except for the seven most populous counties, from one to eight counties comprise a district and the voters therein, on a district-wide basis, elect the senator for that district. The seven most populous counties are divided into from two to seven districts each and the voters in each such county, instead of electing only one senator from the district in which they reside, elect, on a county-wide basis, that number of senators that the county has districts. Appellees, registered voters in multi-district counties of Georgia, brought this action in the Federal District Court against the Secretary of State and local election officials, seeking a decree that the county-wide voting requirement in the seven multi-district counties violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A three-judge District Court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, holding that the difference between electing senators in districts comprising a county or group of counties and in the multi-district counties constitutes invidious discrimination. Held: Equal protection does not necessarily require formation of all single-member districts in a State's legislative apportionment scheme. Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, followed.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nGeorgia's 1962 Senatorial Reapportionment Act\n1\n apportions the 54 seats of the Georgia Senate among the State's \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n 159 counties. The 54 senatorial districts created by the Act are drawn, so far as possible, along existing county lines. Thirty-three of the senatorial districts are made up of from one to eight counties each,\n2\n and voters in these districts elect their senators by a district-wide vote. The remaining 21 senatorial districts are allotted in groups of from two to seven among the seven most populous counties, but voters in these districts do not elect a senator by a district-wide vote; instead they join with the voters of the other districts of the county in electing all the county's senators by a county-wide vote.\n\nThe appellees, registered voters of Georgia, brought this action in the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Secretary of State of Georgia and local election officials seeking a decree that the requirement of county-wide voting in the seven multi-district counties violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A three-judge court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, stating that \"The statute causes a clear difference in the treatment accorded voters in each of the two classes of senatorial districts. It is the same law applied differently to different \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n persons. The voters select their own senator in one class of districts. In the other they do not. They must join with others in selecting a group of senators and their own choice of a senator may be nullified by what voters in other districts of the group desire. This difference is a discrimination as between voters in the two classes. . . . The statute here is nothing more than a classification of voters in senatorial districts on the basis of homesite, to the end that some are allowed to select their representatives while others are not. It is an invidious discrimination tested by any standard.\" 228 F. Supp. 259, 263. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n379 \nU.S. 810\n. We reverse.\n\nOnly last Term, in our opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, decided after the decision below, we rejected the notion that equal protection necessarily requires the formation of single-member districts. In discussing the impact on bicameralism of the equal-protection standards, we said, \"One body could be composed of single-member districts while the other could have at least some multi-member districts.\" \n377 \nU.S., at 577\n. (Emphasis supplied.) Again, in holding that a State might legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, such as counties, we said: \"Single-member districts may be the rule in one State, while another State might desire to achieve some flexibility by creating multi-member or floterial districts. Whatever the means of accomplishment, the overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\" \n377 \nU.S., at 579\n. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nIt is not contended that there is not \"substantial equality of population\" among the 54 senatorial districts. The equal protection argument is focused solely upon the question whether county-wide voting in the seven multi-district \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n counties results in denying the residents therein a vote \"approximately equal in weight to that of\" voters resident in the single-member constituencies. Contrary to the District Court, we cannot say that it does. There is clearly no mathematical disparity. Fulton County, the State's largest constituency, has a population nearly seven times larger than that of a single-district constituency and for that reason elects seven senators. Every Fulton County voter, therefore, may vote for seven senators to represent his interests in the legislature. But the appellees assert that this scheme is defective because county-wide voting in multi-district counties could, as a matter of mathematics, result in the nullification of the unanimous choice of the voters of a district, thereby thrusting upon them a senator for whom no one in the district had voted. But this is only a highly hypothetical assertion\n3\n that, in any event, ignores the practical realities \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n of representation in a multi-member constituency. It is not accurate to treat a senator from a multi-district county as the representative of only that district within the county wherein he resides. The statute uses districts in multi-district counties merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or representation. Each district's senator must be a resident of that district, but since his tenure depends upon the county-wide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the county, and not merely those of people in his home district; thus in fact he is the county's and not merely the district's senator. If the weight of the vote of any voter in a Fulton County district, when he votes for seven senators to represent him in the Georgia Senate, is not the exact equivalent of that of a resident of a single-member constituency, we cannot say that his vote is not \"approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\"\n\nIn reversing the District Court we should emphasize that the equal-protection claim below was based upon an alleged infirmity that attaches to the statute on its face. Agreeing with appellees' contention that the multi-member constituency feature of the Georgia scheme was per se bad, the District Court entered the decree on summary judgment. We treat the question as presented in that \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n context, and our opinion is not to be understood to say that in all instances or under all circumstances such a system as Georgia has will comport with the dictates of the Equal Protection Clause. It might well be that, designedly or otherwise, a multi-member constituency apportionment scheme, under the circumstances of a particular case, would operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population. When this is demonstrated it will be time enough to consider whether the system still passes constitutional muster. This question, however, is not presented by the record before us. It is true that appellees asserted in one short paragraph of their brief in this Court that the county-wide election method was resorted to by Georgia in order to minimize the strength of racial and political minorities in the populous urban counties. But appellees never seriously pressed this point below and offered no proof to support it, the District Court did not consider or rule on its merits, and in oral argument here counsel for appellees stressed that they do not rely on this argument. The record thus does not contain any substantiation of the bald assertion in appellees' brief. Since, under these circumstances, this issue has \"not been formulated to bring it into focus, and the evidence has not been offered or appraised to decide it, our holding has no bearing on that wholly separate question.\" Wright v. Rockefeller, \n376 \nU.S. 52, 58\n.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ga. Laws, Sept.-Oct. 1962, Extra. Sess., pp. 7-31; Ga. Code Ann. 47-102 (Cum. Supp. 1963). Section 9, the provision in question here, provides in pertinent part that:\n\n\"Each Senator must be a resident of his own Senatorial District and shall be elected by the voters of his own District, except that the Senators from those Senatorial Districts consisting of less than one county shall be elected by all the voters of the county in which such Senatorial District is located.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Shortly after the enactment of this statute, and prior to the election of senators under it in the 1962 general elections, an action was brought in a state court that challenged the validity of the above provision under the Georgia Constitution. The state court held that the exception in the 1962 statute was unconstitutional as a matter of state law under the then-existing Georgia Constitution. Finch v. Gray, No. A 96441 (Fulton County Super. Ct., Oct. 30, 1962). The court entered a permanent injunction requiring that elections in Fulton and DeKalb Counties be held on a district-wide basis only. Appeal was taken from this decision but was withdrawn. In its opinion the Georgia Court noted that the Georgia Legislature had authorized the submission of a constitutional amendment to the people ratifying the 1962 reapportionment statute with its multi-district-voting exception and all elections held under that statute. (The amendment was ratified. See Ga. Const. Art. III, II, par. I; Ga. Code Ann. 2-1401 (Cum. Supp. 1963).) The court stated concerning the proposed amendment:\n\n\"It is to be observed that by Paragraph (b) of said proposed Amendment to the Constitution, the General Assembly submitted to the people the question whether they would ratify the Reapportionment Act and elections thereunder. This proposed Amendment, of course, is prospective and will become a part of the Constitution only if ratified by the voters in the coming general election.\n\n\n\"The effect of ratification by the people of the Reapportionment Act containing the unconstitutional exception aforesaid is not now before the Court for determination. See, however, on this subject: Walker v. Wilcox Co., 95 Apps. 185; Hammond v. Clark, 136 Ga. 313; Bailey v. Housing Authority of City of Bainbridge, 214 Ga. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n 790; Grayson-Robinson Stores, Inc. v. Oneida, Ltd., 209 Ga. 613; 9 Mercer L. Rev. 194, 195; 11 Am. Juris., page 832, section 151. The importance here of the aforesaid proposed constitutional Amendment is simply for the light it sheds upon the intention of the General Assembly in enacting the Reapportionment statute.\"\n\n\n The question of Georgia law raised by the decisions cited by the court as to whether a statute declared unconstitutional under Georgia law may be revived by a subsequent constitutional amendment was not raised below and has not been urged here. Of course, this question of Georgia law is not for us; our decision concerns only the federal constitutional question presented and argued.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These 33 senatorial districts embrace 152 of the State's 159 counties. Of the 33 districts, only two consist of single counties; the remaining 31 districts are comprised of from two to eight counties each.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Appellees take as their example Senatorial District 34, in which there are 82,195 of Fulton County's total of 556,326 voters. They say, as a matter of mathematics, that even if every voter in District 34 voted for the same candidate from that district, less than 18% of the voters in the other six districts within the county (i. e., approximately 85,000 of the remaining 474,131 voters in the county) could outvote the unanimous choice of District 34 voters. First of all, there is no demonstration that this is likely in light of the political composition of District 34 vis-a-vis that of the rest of the county. (In fact, the 1962 elections in both Fulton and DeKalb Counties - wherein all appellees reside - were conducted on a district-wide basis rather than a county-wide basis. See note 1, supra.) But apart from this, appellees' mathematics are misleading, for not only will the 18%, or 85,000, of the remaining Fulton County voters vote for a senatorial candidate resident in District 34, but also the remaining 389,131 voters will presumably participate in his election. Assuming these additional voters split their votes almost evenly between two candidates running from District 34 - the most \"favorable\" assumption for appellees in that it will produce the smallest possible percentage of voters who can outvote the unanimous choice of the voters in District 34 - there will be approximately 280,000 votes against the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n choice of the voters in the 34th District, or about 59% of the remaining, out-of-district vote. This is a far cry from the 18% figure calculated by appellees. And, even if, on some odd chance, only 85,000 voters outside of District 34 participate in the selection of a senator from that district, and all vote against the unanimous choice of District 34 voters, the 18% figure is still misleading. For in this eventuality, the relevant voting constituency consists of something under 170,000 voters, and close to 100% - not 18% - of the out-of-district vote has to be cast against the choice of the in-district vote in order to outvote the latter. Our decision should not be read, however, as resting upon the misleading aspects of appellees' calculations.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nUnder the compulsion of last Term's reapportionment decisions I join the opinion and judgment of the Court, but with one reservation. There is language in today's opinion, unnecessary to the Court's resolution of this case, that might be taken to mean that the constitutionality of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n state legislative apportionments must, in the last analysis, always be judged in terms of simple arithmetic.\n\nAs this Court embarks on the difficult business of putting flesh on the bones of Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, and its companion decisions of last June, I desire expressly to reserve for a case which squarely presents the issue, the question of whether the principles announced in those decisions require such a sterile approach to the concept of equal protection in the political field.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nGeorgia - whose political hierarchy was long constructed on the county-unit\n*\n basis - has made an important change. The Georgia Constitution was amended to read:\n\n \"The Senate shall consist of 54 members. The General Assembly shall have authority to create, rearrange and change senatorial districts and to provide for the election of Senators from each senatorial district, or from several districts embraced within one county, in such manner as the General Assembly may deem advisable.\" (Italics added.) Art. III,  II, par. I.\n\n\n The \"senatorial district\" is thus made the unit in the election of senators. But the Senatorial Reapportionment Act provides in relevant part:\n\n \"Each Senator must be a resident of his own senatorial district and shall be elected by the voters of his own district, except that the Senators from those senatorial districts consisting of less than one county shall be elected by all the voters of the county in which such senatorial district is located.\"\n\n\n Thus \"senatorial districts\" are put into two classifications: first, those comprising one or more counties; second, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n those consisting of less than one county. The \"equal protection\" problem under the Fourteenth Amendment arises by reason of the fact that all electors of the districts in the first group choose their own senators, while the electors of the districts in the second group must share the choice of their senators with all the other electors in their county. I agree with the District Court: \". . . voters in some senatorial districts cannot be treated differently from voters in other senatorial districts. The statute here is nothing more than a classification of voters in senatorial districts on the basis of homesite, to the end that some are allowed to select their representatives while others are not.\" 228 F. Supp. 259, 263.\n\nThere are seven senatorial districts within Fulton County:\n\nDistrict 34 containing 82,195 voters. District 35 containing 82,888 voters. District 36 containing 79,023 voters. District 37 containing 78,540 voters. District 38 containing 78,953 voters. District 39 containing 79,713 voters. District 40 containing 74,834 voters.\n\n\n There are three senatorial districts in De Kalb County:\n\nDistrict 41 containing 75,117 voters. District 42 containing 95,032 voters. District 43 containing 86,633 voters.\n\n\n As appellees point out, even if a candidate for one of those districts obtained all of the votes in that district, he could still be defeated by the foreign vote, while he would of course be elected if he were running in a district in the first group. I have no idea how this weighted voting might produce prejudice race-wise, religion-wise, politics-wise. But to allow some candidates to be chosen by the electors in their districts and others to be defeated by the voters of foreign districts is in my view an \"invidious \n\n[379 \nU.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n discrimination\" - the test of unequal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Baker v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186, 244\n. I had assumed we had settled this question in Gray v. Sanders, \n372 \nU.S. 368, 379\n, where we said: \"Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote - whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit. This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] South v.

(See Hammond v. Clarke, 136 Ga. 313, for a discussion by the Georgia Supreme Court of what constitutes separate amendments). Nor shall anything in this order prevent the calling by the General Assembly of a `convention of the people to revise, amend or change the constitution' if the representation `in the convention is based on population as near as practicable' with the members being elected by the people (see Article XIII, Section I, Article 2). Constitution of the State of Georgia, 1945.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThis is the first time that the Court, after plenary briefing and argument, has been called on to consider the propriety of interim arrangements prescribed by a district court pending the effectuation of its decision requiring reapportionment of a branch of a state legislature.\n\nAfter holding that the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Georgia was unconstitutionally composed, a decision which is not called into question on this appeal, the three-judge District Court ordered: (1) that the election in 1964 of the legislature to serve in 1965 (the 1965 legislature) might proceed under the State's existing methods of apportionment; (2) that until a properly apportioned legislature took office no other legislature could propose to the electorate, except through the calling of a convention of popularly elected delegates, the adoption of a new state constitution; and (3) that (except for reapportionment legislation) the 1965 House should be \"limited,\" notwithstanding any provision of state law, \"to the enactment of such legislation as shall properly come before the said Legislature during the regular 1965 45-day session\" provided by Georgia law. After the State's appeal was filed in this Court this last \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 624]\n\u00a0\n provision was in effect abrogated by the District Court with the approval of the parties.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThis appeal draws in question the validity of items (2) and (3) above, similarly numbered in the District Court's order. It is contended by the appellees, however, that both these issues have now become moot.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Court's disposition of this case, of course, involves a holding that at least as to item (2) the case is not moot. For, contrary to what my Brother GOLDBERG says in his dissenting opinion (post, pp. 636-638) and as my Brother CLARK seems to recognize (ante), the Court does not remand the case to the District Court for a determination on the issue of mootness, but only to decide whether any injunctive relief is now appropriate in light of what has transpired since such relief was first granted.\n\nWhile it may be that the Court's implicit holding on mootness does not reach beyond the portion of the District Court's decree that goes to the submission of a proposed new state constitution (par. (2) of the decree), I would also hold not moot the pronouncement of that decree placing limitations on the functioning of the 1965 State Legislature (original par. (3) of the decree).\n\nAs to paragraph (2), it is sufficient to say that the injunction has continuing effect, not only with respect to the 1965 legislature, but also as to any successor legislature if it is found to be \"malapportioned.\" Any alleged \"speculativeness\" as to whether a new state constitution may be proposed to the electorate before a \"constitutional\" legislature comes into being, goes not to mootness but only to the question whether the District Court (assuming its power in the premises, see below) should \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 625]\n\u00a0\n have granted any relief on this score.\n2\n So far as original paragraph (3) of the decree is concerned (limiting the activities of the 1965 legislature) it was not rendered moot by the District Court's modification after the case had been taken for review by this Court. Analytically, the situation is tantamount to a confession of error at this level, at most relieving this Court of the necessity of making a definitive exposition of its views on this subject (compare the suggestion of my Brother GOLDBERG, post, pp. 638-639), but not depriving the question of the attribute of justiciability. Cf. Young v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 257, 258\n-259.\n\nThe position adopted by the Court is that although the case is not moot, at least as to the \"constitution-submission\" issue, decision of that question could be avoided if the District Court chose to vacate that part of its injunction in light of the change in circumstance which has made the need for such relief speculative; the Court therefore remands the case to afford the District Court that opportunity. I do not think that such avoidance as to either question is called for in this case. The Court's reapportionment decisions have pressed district courts onto an uncharted and highly sensitive field of federalstate relations with little more to guide them than the elusive \"one-person-one-vote\" aphorism. District courts, as courts of first instance, must necessarily fashion remedies for themselves, and the passage of time and the variety of remedies chosen by them may ultimately help this Court to wend its way through this treacherous constitutional terrain. But it is essential that the lower courts at least be launched in the right general direction and not allowed to range so far afield as to hamstring state legislatures and deprive States of effective \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 626]\n\u00a0\n legislative government. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of the injunction involved in this case do range that far afield. Absent disapproval by this Court, the decision below, rendered by a distinguished panel, cannot fail to furnish a strong practical, if not legal, precedent for other district courts. I do not think this should be allowed to happen.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nI would hold the decree below improvident in both the aspects before us.\n\nAs to the provision forbidding submission to the electorate of a legislatively proposed new state constitution, I can find nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment, elsewhere in the Constitution, or in any decision of this Court which requires a State to initiate complete or partial constitutional change only by some method in which every voice in the voting population is given an opportunity to express itself. Can there be the slightest constitutional doubt that a State may lodge the power to initiate constitutional changes in any select body it pleases, such as a committee of the legislature, a group of constitutional lawyers, or even a \"malapportioned\" legislature - particularly one whose composition was considered, prior to this Court's reapportionment pronouncements of June 15, 1964, to be entirely and solely a matter of state concern?\n3\n\u00a0\n\nSimilarly as to the provision of the lower court's original decree limiting the functions of the 1965 legislature, it seems scarcely open to serious doubt that so long as the federal courts allow this Georgia Legislature to sit, it must be regarded as the de facto legislature of the State, possessing the full panoply of legislative powers accorded by Georgia law. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 627]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI think that the State of Georgia is entitled to a clearcut pronouncement from this Court that nothing in its reapportionment decisions contemplated such unheard-of federal court intrusion into state political affairs as the decree before us evinces. Beyond that, for this Court to temporize with important interstitial matters of this kind, deeply affecting the even course of federal-state relations, can only serve to aggravate the confusion which last June's reapportionment cases have left in their wake.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nI would modify the decree below by striking therefrom paragraph (2) and approving the substitute for original paragraph (3) as framed by the District Court.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The full text of the District Court's order and the amendment of item 3 are printed in the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG as Appendices A and B, respectively. Post, pp. 639, 641.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Labor Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines. Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 261, 271\n; Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n219 \nU.S. 498, 514\n-515.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] If, as I believe, a State is not federally restricted in its choice of means for initiating constitutional change, the question of whether, under Georgia law, the proposed new Georgia Constitution should have been initiated by a popularly elected convention instead of by the legislature is not a matter for federal cognizance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] To hold as I think the Court should on these issues would not in any way impair the federal courts' ability to prevent frustration of their reapportionment decrees.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nI dissent from the Court's disposition of this case. By remanding, the Court is, in effect, asking the District Court to decide whether this appeal, which is pending before us and with respect to which we noted probable jurisdiction and heard argument, should be dismissed as moot due to events occurring after the appeal had been perfected in this Court. Mootness, in my view, is a question which, under these circumstances, this Court has the responsibility to decide. The facts relevant to this issue are undisputed. The District Court is in no better position to resolve the issue of mootness than we. No legitimate purpose is served by asking it to determine a question which is properly before us and which a long line of unbroken precedents would have us decide.\n1\n Moreover, if the case is moot, as I believe, there is no need for a further time-consuming hearing below and a possible future second \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 628]\n\u00a0\n appeal to this Court. Surely both the District Court and this Court have enough to do without this Court creating unnecessary work for both. I would simply vacate the injunction order and dismiss this appeal as moot.\n\nThat this case is in fact moot becomes apparent from a consideration of the history of this litigation.\n\nThe appeal calls into question the validity of portions of an injunction issued by a three-judge District Court involving the reapportionment of the Georgia House of Representatives. The District Court entered an order on June 30, 1964, holding that the Georgia House of Representatives was unconstitutionally apportioned under the Federal Constitution and declaring invalid state constitutional and statutory apportionment provisions. The court's order allowed the November 1964 elections for the House of Representatives to take place under the then-existing constitutional and statutory provisions, but it required that new elections be held in 1965 in time for a properly apportioned legislature to take office no later than \"the second Monday in January, 1966.\" Paragraph (2) of the court's order further enjoined appellants, state election officials, from placing on the November 1964 election ballot a new state constitution proposed by the then-existing unconstitutionally apportioned legislature, and it also enjoined the submission of a wholly new constitution to the voters by the legislature \"at any subsequent election until the [legislature] . . . is reapportioned in accordance with constitutional standards.\" Paragraph (3) of the District Court's order limited the power of the 1965 legislature to enacting \"such legislation as shall properly come before [it] . . . during the regular 1965 45-day session.\" Appellants' motion for a stay of the District Court's order was denied by MR. JUSTICE BLACK on July 6, 1964.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 629]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAppellants appealed to this Court. In their jurisdictional statement they did not contest the basic holding that the House of Representatives was unconstitutionally apportioned. They challenged the validity of portions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of the District Court's order.\n3\n Appellees moved to affirm on the ground that the order was in all respects valid. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n379 \nU.S. 809\n, and granted appellants' motion to advance the cause for oral argument.\n\nShortly prior to argument, appellees moved that this appeal be dismissed because events supervening since the entry of the District Court's order rendered this appeal moot. Appellants opposed this motion. Consideration of appellees' motion to dismiss was postponed until the hearing.\n\nUpon argument of this case it appeared without dispute that, since the entry of the order below, the parties had agreed upon modifications which eliminated appellants' objections to paragraph (3) of the District Court's order and that the District Court, on November 3, 1964, had entered an order embodying the agreed-upon modifications.\n4\n It likewise was agreed at the argument that the new constitution proposed by the legislature was not submitted to the voters in November 1964 and that under Georgia law it has lapsed and cannot be resubmitted. Thus the only issue remaining in this case is the validity of that portion of the District Court's order which prevents the newly elected or any future unconstitutionally \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 630]\n\u00a0\n apportioned legislature from proposing and submitting to the voters a wholly new state constitution.\n\nAppellees in their motion to dismiss and at the argument stated that although they originally sought affirmance of the portion of the District Court's order now under consideration, they no longer do so because, due to supervening events, it is now \"highly speculative\" as to whether the newly elected legislature\n5\n or any future unconstitutionally apportioned legislature will ever submit another wholly new constitution to the voters. Appellees state that consequently they no longer need the protection given them by the District Court's prohibition of such a submission, and that \"this appeal presents only an abstract, hypothetical controversy in which the `lively conflict between antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the controverted issue a practical necessity' is lacking.\"\n6\n They suggest that for these reasons controversy over this portion of the order has now become moot and urge that the appeal be dismissed and that this portion of the order be vacated. Appellants \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 631]\n\u00a0\n resist the motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness. They contend that this Court should reach the merits and reverse the basic determination of the District Court that under the Federal Constitution a malapportioned legislature is without power to propose a new constitution to the voters.\n7\n They argue that a decision on the merits is called for because the issuance of the prior opinion of the District Court granting the injunction will have a precedential and deterrent effect, notwithstanding the vacation of the injunction order.\n\nAs this history shows, the appeal, in its present posture, is plainly moot under long-established principles and precedents. The question appellants would have us decide is one of grave import involving the power under the Federal Constitution of a malapportioned legislature to submit a state constitution to a popular vote - a question which necessarily involves a consideration of the varying systems used in different States for proposing constitutional amendments. The doctrine of \"mootness,\" like the related doctrine of \"ripeness,\" has been evolved by this Court so that it will not have to pass upon this type of question except upon the urging of one who is harmed or is currently threatened with harm caused by the allegedly unconstitutional action. See Stearns v. Wood, \n236 \nU.S. 75\n. While this Court cannot and will not avoid its constitutional responsibility to decide apportionment cases arising when justiciable problems are presented and pressed for decision by litigants \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 632]\n\u00a0\n claiming an abridgment of their constitutional rights,\n8\n it should not, in apportionment cases, as in other areas, decide moot issues, volunteer judgments or seek out questions which have ceased to be ripe for adjudication\n9\n and are no longer presented in the context of an actual pending controversy.\n10\n I strongly, albeit respectfully, disagree with my Brother HARLAN'S intimation, grounded on his basic view that the Court should never have entered into reapportionment matters at all, that now that it has been decided that such issues are justiciable, this Court should be more willing in this \"sensitive\" area than in other areas, to give opinions of an advisory nature, so that \"the lower courts [will] at least be launched in the right general direction and not allowed to range so far afield.\" Opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, ante, p. 625. Moreover, it has already been demonstrated, as was easily predictable from the history of other constitutional issues of a \"sensitive\" nature, that there is in this area ample opportunity to guide the lower courts within the traditional bounds of concrete, live controversies, actively pressed by real adverse parties. See Fortson v. Dorsey, ante, p. 433; Scranton v. Drew, ante, p. 40.\n\nThis Court does not pass upon constitutional questions unless it is necessary to do so to preserve the rights of the parties. See Liverpool, N. Y. & P. S. S. Co. v. Commissioners, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 341\n, 345-348 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis); Coffman v. Breeze Corps., \n323 \nU.S. 316, 325\n. Nor does it decide abstract questions merely because of the effect such judgments might have \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 633]\n\u00a0\n upon future actions in similar circumstances. Little v. Bowers, \n134 \nU.S. 547, 558\n; California v. San Pablo & T. R. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 308, 314\n; Kimball v. Kimball, \n174 \nU.S. 158\n. In the present case we are told by the proponents of the injunction that there exists only a remote possibility that the newly elected legislature or some future one will submit a wholly new constitution to the voters. Cf. Bus Employees v. Missouri, \n374 \nU.S. 74, 78\n. If the question of the legislature's power to propose such a constitution were being submitted to a court as an initial matter, the speculativeness of the legislature's future conduct would undoubtedly render this issue unripe for adjudication. See New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n; Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423\n; Electric Bond & Share Co. v. SEC, \n303 \nU.S. 419, 443\n; Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450, 471\n; United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612\n. The speculativeness, which has arisen in this case since the order was entered, makes the issue in this appeal, in my view, similarly unsuitable for adjudication. United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n.\n\nThe appellees themselves, in whose favor the judgment below has run, do not assert the need for the protection of the District Court's order against future submission of a new constitution; they deem the possibility of such a submission too remote. They therefore are agreeable to the vacation of the injunction which they sought and obtained. This obviously will relieve appellants of any burden which the injunction imposes upon them. It also will remove any precedential effect of the opinion of the District Court on this issue. United States v. Munsingwear, \n340 \nU.S. 36, 39\n-41; Note, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 772, 794. Appellants would have the injunction reversed on the merits as improperly issued rather than vacated as appellees desire. Although there is this difference as to the proper disposition of this case, the net \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 634]\n\u00a0\n result is that no party wishes the injunction to remain in effect. In the present posture of the case, the conclusion which emerges is that although the parties differ with respect to the abstract legal question of the validity of the order, there is no longer present here that \"real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals\" which assures us that a cause is in a \"real sense adversary.\"\n11\n Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n; United States v. Johnson, \n319 \nU.S. 302, 305\n. Appellants' argument that the order, though vacated, will have an inhibitory effect upon the legislature's activity is but a way of saying that appellants desire to know for their own purposes, as a guide to future conduct, what this Court would have said on the merits, had the issue remained embedded in a real and substantial controversy. Without such a controversy currently existing between those who appear as adverse parties, this Court should not give an opinion upon questions of law \"which a party desires to know for . . . his own purposes.\"\n12\n Cleveland v. Chamberlain, 1 Black 419, 426; see Woodpaper Co. v. Heft, 8 Wall. 333; South Spring Hill Gold \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 635]\n\u00a0\n Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., \n145 \nU.S. 300\n.\n\nThe situation in this case is a far cry from that presented in Bus Employees v. Missouri, supra, where an \"existing unresolved dispute\" made the likelihood of repetition of the conduct in question much greater than the mere \"speculative\" possibility existing here. Id., at 78. Nor do other decisions\n13\n relied upon by appellants support their position. In none of these cases was there any assertion, as here, by the party for whose benefit the injunction order was issued, that it had become highly problematical that the conduct which underlay the controversy would be repeated. In Federal Trade Comm'n v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., \n304 \nU.S. 257\n; J. I. Case Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332\n, relied upon by appellants, the party supporting the validity of the order called into question contended that the order was necessary and its validity should be reviewed. In the instant case whether or not the legislature, while still malapportioned, will submit a wholly new constitution to the voters is highly problematical, and the parties supporting the correctness of the injunction themselves feel that it should be vacated since they see no threat that the legislature will repeat conduct they consider illegal. The case is, therefore, much more closely analogous to United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., supra, in which this Court refused to review the question of the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to require carriers to comply with an ICC order prescribing certain bills of lading. A three-judge District Court had found the Commission had no such power and had enjoined the Commission from ever issuing such an order. Before argument in this Court, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 636]\n\u00a0\n however, it became clear that provisions in the bills of lading prescribed by the Commission conflicted with provisions contained in new legislation passed by Congress after the District Court's decision. Since the particular bills of lading prescribed would have to be withdrawn by the Commission in view of this legislation, and because of the uncertainty as to whether the Commission would prescribe new bills of lading or the form they would take, this Court refused to decide the issue of whether the Commission had the power to prescribe any bills of lading. The Court stated, \"However convenient it might be to have decided the question of the power of the Commission to require the carriers to comply with an order prescribing bills of lading, this court `is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it.'\" \n253 \nU.S., at 116\n. The Court reversed the District Court's order and remanded the case to the District Court \"with directions to dismiss the petition . . . without prejudice to the right of the complainants to assail in the future any order of the Commission prescribing bills of lading after the enactment of the new legislation.\" Id., at 116-117. Unless Alaska S. S. Co., is to be overruled or ignored, the Court should act similarly here.\n\nFinally, I find the Court's disposition of this case mystifying, for I cannot understand what the District Court is to do upon remand. Since the District Court's order has been vacated, no injunction will be in effect. Presumably the District Court will have before it two groups of parties, one group urging that no order be entered and the other group claiming that no order is necessary because the likelihood of the legislature's resubmitting a new constitution is too remote. It is inconceivable to me that the District Court would be warranted in rein-stating \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 637]\n\u00a0\n its injunction under the present facts. Of course, if circumstances changed, and there was a real, rather than a tenuous threat of further legislative action of the type originally complained of, the District Court, which has retained jurisdiction of this case, would be empowered to entertain an application for appropriate injunctive relief. However, I cannot understand the logic of the Court's decision in asking the District Court now to make a determination which, under the present circumstances, is rightfully our responsibility.\n\nMy Brother HARLAN suggests that, contrary to my view, \"the Court does not remand the case to the District Court for a determination on the issue of mootness, but only to decide whether any injunctive relief is now appropriate in light of what has transpired since such relief was first granted.\" Ante, p. 624. But with due respect, I suggest that his interpretation of the Court's opinion is not justified by what the Court says or does. The Court explicitly sets forth appellees' contention that the case is moot because \"[t]he situation has changed somewhat since the 1964 election,\" and \"it is now highly speculative as to what the 1965 legislature will do\" (ante, p. 622), and then the Court remands the case for reconsideration of the desirability of and need for the injunction in terms of the contentions raised by appellees, i. e., \"in light of the results of the 1964 election and the representations of appellees.\" Ibid. This surely must mean that the Court is asking the District Court to consider appellees' contentions that the case is moot. Further, I might better understand my Brother HARLAN'S general distinction between determining whether a case is moot and whether an injunction is still appropriate if there were some issue in this case other than the power of the District Court to issue the injunction. But the only issue presented for decision on the merits is whether the District Court validly issued this type of injunction; thus to decide here \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 638]\n\u00a0\n whether, in light of the changed circumstances and the parties' present desires, continuance of the injunction is still appropriate is to decide the identical question as to whether, in light of these changed circumstances and the present contentions of the parties, the case has become moot. Determining the issue of mootness and deciding \"whether any injunctive relief is now appropriate in light of what has transpired since such relief was first granted,\" both come down to the same thing - the question is whether, at this juncture, as appellees contend, \"this appeal presents only an abstract, hypothetical controversy in which the `lively conflict between antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the controverted issue a practical necessity' is lacking.\" The question is one for this Court to decide.\n\nI believe that the proper result in this case would be to sustain the appellees' motion to dismiss for mootness and to enter an order vacating paragraph (2) of the District Court's order of June 30, 1964, prohibiting submission of a wholly new constitution to the voters by the legislature at the 1964 election or \"at any subsequent election until [it] . . . is reapportioned in accordance with constitutional standards.\" Thus this portion of the slate would be wiped clean, United States v. Munsingwear, supra, without any necessity for further proceedings below to try the mootness issue. In view of the parties' stipulations before this Court that they accept the modifications entered by the District Court on November 3, 1964, I believe that the Court is correct in not passing upon the validity of paragraph (3) of the District Court's order of June 30, 1964 - that portion of the order which appellants took as limiting the powers of the 1965 legislature. However, because of doubts expressed as to the jurisdiction of the District Court to enter its modified order while appeal is pending in this Court, see Schempp v. School District, 184 F. Supp. 381 (D.C. E. D. Pa.), the Court \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 639]\n\u00a0\n ought also to vacate paragraph (3) of the June 30, 1964, order on the assumption that the District Court will re-enter its modified order of November 3, 1964, in accordance with the agreement of the parties.\n\nThe federal district courts have enough to do in deciding ripe reapportionment cases without our requiring them to decide stale ones.\n\n  APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE    GOLDBERG, DISSENTING.\n\n\n  FINAL ORDER OF THE COURT OF JUNE 30, 1964.\n\n\n   Revised Order.\n\n\n All parties having consented thereto, the order of the Court dated June 24, 1964, is hereby revised to read as follows:\n\nIt is now Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed as follows:\n\n(1) Article III, Section III, Paragraph I (Code Section 2-1501) of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945, is hereby declared to be null, void and inoperative, as being in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nSection 47-101 of the Code of Georgia, as amended, is hereby declared to be prospectively null, void and inoperative, as being in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for elections to the House of Representatives after the General Election to be held in November of 1964.\n\n(2) The defendants are hereby enjoined from placing on the ballot to be used in the General Election to be held on November 3, 1964, or at any subsequent election until the General Assembly is reapportioned in accordance with constitutional standards, the question whether a constitutional amendment purporting to amend the present state constitution by substituting an entirely new \n\n[379 \nU.S. 621, 640]\n\u00a0\n constitution therefor shall be adopted; provided, however, nothing in this order shall prevent the submission of amendments to the Constitution of the State of Georgia which are separate as to subject matter, in accordance with Article XIII, Section I, Article 1, of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, 1945. (See Hammond v. Clarke, 136 Ga. 313, for a discussion by the Georgia Supreme Court of what constitutes separate amendments). Nor shall anything in this order prevent the calling by the General Assembly of a \"convention of the people to revise, amend or change the constitution\" if the representation \"in the convention is based on population as near as practicable\" with the members being elected by the people (see Article XIII, Section I, Article 2).

JUSTICE    GOLDBERG, DISSENTING.\n\n\n  ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF NOVEMBER 3, 1964.\n\n\n Both parties agree that the motion for alternative relief should be granted. Therefore, paragraph 3 of the order of June 30, 1964, is hereby stricken and the following paragraph 3 is substituted in lieu thereof:\n\n\"(3) The motion of the plaintiffs for further injunctive relief prior to the conduct of the party primaries or conventions and the General Election of November 3, 1964, is hereby denied at this time, provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in Article III, Section IV, Paragraph I (Code Section 2-1601) of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945 to the contrary, the service of the members of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia to be elected at the General Election in November, 1964, shall be limited to a term of one year's duration and provided further that the plaintiffs shall have the right to reapply to this Court for further relief should the General Assembly, which convenes in January, 1965, fail to enact, during the regular 1965 45-day session, as provided in the Georgia Constitution, such legislation as may be necessary for the General Assembly to be reapportioned in accordance with Constitutional requirements and as may be necessary to permit the holding of elections to the newly constituted General Assembly during the calendar year 1965, which elections are to be held at such time as may be necessary to permit the members of such newly constituted General Assembly to take office no later than the second Monday in January, 1966. To the extent that state statutory and constitutional provisions might otherwise conflict with such legislative reapportionment, they are hereby declared to be void and of no effect.\"\n\n\n This 3rd day of November, 1964.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., San Mateo County v. Southern Pac. R. Co., \n116 \nU.S. 138\n; United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n; Bus Employees v. Wisconsin Board, \n340 \nU.S. 416\n; Oil Workers Unions v. Missouri, \n361 \nU.S. 363\n, and the numerous cases cited at 368, n. 7 therein.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The District Court's order of June 30, 1964, is printed as Appendix A.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Appellants interpreted paragraph (3) of the order to mean that the 1965 legislature could only deal with what was legally considered to be \"legislation.\" They feared that the legislature would be unable to conduct investigations, vote pardons, or perform other similar duties. They also were concerned that under the terms of the District Court's order the 1965 legislature might be unable to meet in special session if such a session proved necessary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This order is printed here as Appendix B.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Appellees pointed out at the argument that in the new legislature which will meet in 1965, 20 of the 54 Senators and 67 of the 205 Representatives will have been newly elected at the November 1964 election.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In their Motion to Dismiss at p. 5, appellees state:\n\n\"Before the proposed new constitution can be placed on the ballot for ratification in any future general election, it must again be submitted to the General Assembly and passed by an affirmative two-thirds vote of both houses. This Court has repeatedly admonished that `constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly.' The mere possibility that a similar constitutional proposal may be passed by the General Assembly at some future time is an insufficient basis for invoking the awesome responsibility of constitutional adjudication by this Court. Without further legislative action, this appeal presents only an abstract, hypothetical controversy in which the `lively conflict between antagonistic demands, actively pressed, which make resolution of the controverted issue a practical necessity' is lacking.\" (Citations omitted.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This portion of the District Court's order also rested upon a determination that under Georgia law the legislature could not submit to the voters a wholly new constitution in the form of an amendment to the existing constitution. Questions are raised as to the correctness of this determination and the propriety of the District Court's having made it. See Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Thibodaux, \n360 \nU.S. 25\n. In light of my resolution of this case, I would not reach these questions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Baker v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186\n; Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, and companion cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See San Mateo County v. Southern Pac. R.

Battle, \n348 \nU.S. 803\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Since their motion to dismiss was reserved until the hearing, appellees have conscientiously argued the merits. However, we cannot ignore the basic fact that they are not pressing for a decision on the merits since they believe they no longer need the protection of the injunction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] That appellants' argument does not show that this Court should reach the merits here is further demonstrated by the fact that any inhibitory effect produced by the District Court's injunction at issue here would also be produced by that part of the injunction prohibiting submission of a new constitution only at the 1964 election. Yet appellants concede, as they must, that this Court would not now review that part of the injunction concerned only with the November 1964 election which has already taken place since the new constitution was not submitted to the voters in November 1964 and under Georgia law it has lapsed and cannot be resubmitted.

California v. Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., ante, p. 366, followed. P. 690.\n\n2. \nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel is not applicable here since only the scope of future regulation concerning transactions not governed by past decisions is involved. P. 690.\n\n Certiorari granted; 334 F.2d 404, reversed.\n\nSolicitor General Cox, Richard A. Solomon, Howard E. Wahrenbrock, Robert L. Russell and Peter H. Schiff for petitioner.\n\nWilliam H. Webster, Edwin S. Nail and Joseph W. Morris for Amerada Petroleum Corp., and William R. Allen and Cecil E. Munn for Signal Oil & Gas Co., respondents.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nMontana-Dakota (MDU) is an interstate natural gas pipeline company, selling and transporting gas in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The lines involved here run to the east and west from the Tioga processing plant in North Dakota, jointly owned by Amerada and Signal, producers of natural gas in North Dakota. Also, running north from the Tioga point is \n\n[379 \nU.S. 687, 688]\n\u00a0\n a line extending to the gasoline extraction plants of Hunt-Herbert and TXL (now Texaco), both in North Dakota.\n\nOn a peak winter day in 1962-1963 MDU was expected to purchase a total of 70,000 Mcf of North Dakota-produced gas from these four producers: 55,000 Mcf from Amerada-Signal, 10,000 Mcf from TXL, and 5,000 Mcf from Hunt-Herbert. Of the 55,000 Mcf from Amerada-Signal, 50,000 Mcf would flow to the east and be consumed in North Dakota. All of the Hunt-Herbert and TXL gas, plus the remaining 5,000 Mcf of the Amerada-Signal gas, would flow to the west - a total of 20,000 Mcf. Of this westward-flowing gas, 10,200 Mcf would be consumed in North Dakota; the remaining 9,800 Mcf would flow across the state boundary into Montana for consumption outside of North Dakota.\n\nOn an average summer day MDU would take about 45,000 Mcf from Amerada-Signal, while continuing to take about 15,000 Mcf from Hunt-Herbert and TXL. Of the Amerada-Signal gas, 13,000 Mcf would flow westward, commingled with the 15,000 Mcf from Hunt-Herbert and TXL. Only 1,680 Mcf of this stream would be consumed in North Dakota; the remaining 26,320 Mcf would flow into Montana to be held in storage for ultimate redelivery to all parts of MDU's interstate system. 32,000 Mcf of gas would flow eastward, all from Amerada-Signal. In contrast to the situation on a peak winter day, only 7,280 Mcf of this eastward-flowing gas would be consumed in North Dakota, while 24,720 Mcf would cross the state boundary and go into storage.\n\nThe contracts for the purchase of gas from Hunt-Herbert and TXL admittedly constitute sales of gas for resale within the meaning of 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717. These sellers applied for and were granted certificates of public convenience and necessity by the Commission. 27 F. P. C. 1092. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 687, 689]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to entering into the Hunt-Herbert-TXL contracts, MDU entered into contracts with Amerada and Signal which are here in issue. First, MDU concluded the so-called \"North Dakota Contracts\" with both Amerada and Signal. Under these contracts MDU must buy at least two-thirds of its annual North Dakota requirements from Amerada-Signal, and it may buy up to all of its North Dakota requirements from them if it so elects. The contracts recite that \"all gas purchased by Buyer under this agreement shall be transported, used and consumed entirely within the State of North Dakota.\" Soon thereafter, MDU entered its separate \"Interstate Contracts\" with Amerada and Signal. These contracts provide that MDU must take or pay for a certain number of Mcf per year (and per day) if available, \"less the quantity of gas which Buyer shall pay for with respect to such calendar year under the Amerada [or Signal] North Dakota Contract.\"\n\nRespondents Amerada and Signal contended before the Federal Power Commission that sales to MDU under the \"North Dakota Contracts\" would be \"nonjurisdictional\" since they were not sales in interstate commerce for resale. Relying on its decision in Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., 26 F. P. C. 606 (reversed, 323 F.2d 190, reversed, ante, p. 366), the Commission rejected the contention and asserted its jurisdiction over the sales. 30 F. P. C. 200. The Court of Appeals reversed. 334 F.2d 404. The Commission has petitioned for writ of certiorari.\n\nAll of the gas purchased by MDU from Amerada-Signal under both sets of contracts is delivered into the pipeline at the Tioga plant. According to the testimony of MDU's engineer, on a peak winter day the pipeline would elect to purchase all of the Amerada-Signal gas under the \"North Dakota Contracts.\" Yet, as previously shown, on such a day some of the Amerada-Signal gas flows westward, in a commingled stream with gas from \n\n[379 \nU.S. 687, 690]\n\u00a0\n other sources, and is resold outside of North Dakota. On an average summer day MDU would elect to purchase about 9,000 Mcf of the Amerada-Signal gas under the \"North Dakota Contracts,\" and the remaining 36,000 Mcf under the \"Interstate Contracts.\" Yet, as previously shown, 1,680 Mcf of the 9,000 Mcf consumed in North Dakota would have to be metered off from the westward-flowing commingled stream that is destined in major part for resale out-of-state.\n\nFactually, therefore, the present case is on all fours with California v. Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., ante, p. 366.\n\nThe Court of Appeals thought that its decision in North Dakota v. Federal Power Comm'n, 247 F.2d 173, brought collateral estoppel into play in the present case. 334 F.2d 404, 411-412. But that rule has no place here for no judgment governing past events is in jeopardy, only the scope of future regulation that involves different events and transactions. See Commissioner v. Sunnen, \n333 \nU.S. 591, 601\n-602.\n\nAccordingly, the writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that this case is clearly controlled by our recent decision in California v. Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., ante, p. 366, and thus join the opinion and judgment of the Court. I concur, however, in order to make explicit my understanding of the rationale of the Court's decision in this case.\n\nAt the time of this action, respondents, as in Lo-Vaca, attributed to themselves a greater percentage of so-called nonjurisdictional gas than their proportionate share of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 687, 691]\n\u00a0\n the gas in the commingled stream.\n*\n Thus, here, as in Lo-Vaca, we need not and do not reach the issue of whether \"in spite of original commingling there might be a separate so-called nonjurisdictional transaction of a precise amount of gas . . . .\" \n379 \nU.S., at 370\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Some years prior to this action Amerada-Signal claimed no more than its proportionate share, and under those circumstances the FPC disclaimed jurisdiction. See North Dakota v. FPC, 247 F.2d 173 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1957). The fact that the amount claimed by respondents at the time of this action exceeds Amerada-Signal's proportionate share is due to the addition of new sources of supply to the commingled stream. This change, standing alone, makes inapplicable any doctrine of collateral estoppel based on the FPC's disclaimer or the Court of Appeal's affirmance in North Dakota v. FPC, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN:\n\n  Yielding to the Court's view that the case-by-case approach is an acceptable method of procedure in this area of the Commission's functions (see the Court's opinion in the Lo-Vaca case at 366 and my dissenting opinion therein at 371), I join the concurring opinion of my Brother GOLDBERG. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 687, 692]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFPC v. UNION ELECTRIC CO.(1965)\nNo. 123\nArgued: March 2, 1965Decided: May 3, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent filed a declaration of intention with the Federal Power Commission (FPC) pursuant to 23 (b) of the Federal Power Act to construct a pumped storage plant on a nonnavigable tributary of a navigable stream. A pumped storage plant uses power during periods of nonpeak demands to pump water to an upper pool to be used to generate peak-period energy by water falling into a lower pool. The FPC found that the nonnavigable tributary is a stream over which Congress has jurisdiction as it is a headwater of a navigable river system. The FPC held that the project would require a license under 23 (b) because it would use water power for the interstate transmission of electricity and because it would affect downstream navigability. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the only relevant \"commerce\" under 23 (b) is that on the downstream navigable waterway and that the project would have no significant impact on water commerce. Held:\n\n 1. The commerce power of Congress clearly encompasses the interstate transmission of electric energy, and the project here is within the purview of that power, without regard to federal control of tributary streams and navigation. P. 94.\n\n\n 2. The language of the licensing requirement of 23 (b) invokes the full congressional authority over commerce and not merely the regulation of navigation or water commerce. Pp. 95-98.\n\n\n 3. The purposes of the predecessor statute, the Federal Water Power Act, which included the comprehensive development of water power and hydroelectric energy, are more fully served by considering the impact of the project on the full range of commerce interests. Pp. 98-109.\n\n\n 4. Since the original Federal Water Power Act was concerned with the utilization of water resources and particularly the power potential in water, there is no anomaly in the FPC's position that steam plants generating energy for interstate transmission are not within the scope of 23 (b), although located on a stream over \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 91]\n\u00a0\n which Congress has jurisdiction, while similar hydroelectric facilities are covered by 23 (b). Pp. 109-110.\n\n\n 326 F.2d 535, reversed.\n\nRalph S. Spritzer argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Frank Goodman, Richard A. Solomon and Howard E. Wahrenbrock.\n\nRobert J. Keefe argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Robert F. Schlafly.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 23 (b)\n1\n of the Federal Power Act\n2\n requires any person desiring to construct a dam or other project on a nonnavigable stream, but one over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce, to file a declaration of intention with the Federal Power Commission. If the Commission finds that \"the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected by such proposed construction,\" the declarant may not construct or operate the project without a license. The issue here is whether the construction of a pumped storage hydroelectric project generating energy for interstate transmission is one which would affect the \"interests of interstate or foreign commerce\" within the intendment of the Act. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nRespondent Union Electric Co. (Union), operating generating plants and an interconnected transmission and distribution system in Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa, filed a declaration of intention pursuant to 23 (b) to construct a pumped storage hydroelectric facility, the Taum Sauk installation, as a part of Union's interstate system. The pumped storage plant, an engineering innovation of growing use, is to supplement the energy produced by other plants during periods of peak demands. During such periods it generates energy through use of hydroelectric units driven by water falling from an elevated reservoir into a lower pool.\n3\n During off-peak periods it uses energy from other sources to pump water from the lower pool back to the headwater pool.\n4\n The project is capable \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n of creating up to 350 megawatts and the energy created will be utilized in Missouri, Illinois, and possibly Iowa. Taum Sauk is to be located on the East Fork of the Black River, about four miles above the confluence of these waters.\n5\n The East Fork is a nonnavigable tributary of the Black River, itself a navigable stream along with the White River into which it flows.\n\nThe FPC found the East Fork was a stream \"over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce,\" since it is a headwater of a navigable river system. The project would affect the interests of commerce and would require a license, the FPC also held, both because it contemplated the utilization of water power for the interstate transmission of electricity and because it would affect downstream navigability, 27 F. P. C. 801. The Court of Appeals reversed, 326 F.2d 535 (C. A. 8th Cir.) holding that the only \"commerce\" which is relevant to the FPC's determination under 23 (b) is commerce on the downstream navigable waterway and that the project in question would have no significant impact on water commerce.\n6\n Absent an \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n effect on downstream navigability, or on irrigation development, flood control projects or planned utilization of water resources, matters which might affect the interests of water commerce, a water power project located on the headwaters of a navigable river is a \"local\" activity beyond the licensing power and consequent regulatory controls of the FPC. Because the question is an unresolved one of jurisdiction over an important class of hydroelectric projects, we granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 812\n, and now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We have determined that its limitation of the FPC's licensing power to projects affecting commerce on navigable waters is founded upon an erroneous reading of the language of 23 (b) and the design and purposes of the Federal Water Power Act.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nTo focus the inquiry, it is well to state what is not involved in this case. There is no question that the interstate transmission of electric energy is fully subject to the commerce powers of Congress. Public Utilities Comm'n v. Attleboro Steam & Elec. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83, 86\n; Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, \n303 \nU.S. 419, 432\n-433. Nor is there any doubt today that projects generating energy for such transmission, such as Taum Sauk, affect commerce among the States and therefore are within the purview of the commerce power, quite without regard to the federal control of tributary streams and navigation. See Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 40\n-41; Labor Board v. Fruehauf \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n Trailer Co., \n301 \nU.S. 49\n; Consolidated Edison v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n; Katzenbach v. McClung, \n379 \nU.S. 294, 301\n-304. But see United States v. Appalachian Power Co., 107 F.2d 769, rev'd on other grounds, \n311 \nU.S. 377\n.\n7\n Thus, there are no constitutional doubts or barriers to the FPC's interpretation. The only question is whether Congress has required a license for a water power project utilizing the headwaters of a navigable river to generate energy for an interstate power system. We think an affirmative answer is required by both the language and purposes of the Act.\n\nThe language of the Act, in our view, plainly requires a license in the circumstances of this case. Section 23 (b)\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n prohibits construction of nonlicensed hydroelectric projects on navigable streams, regardless of any effect, detrimental or beneficial, on navigation or commerce by water and requires those proposing a project on a nonnavigable stream to file a declaration of intention and to come before the Commission for a determination of whether the \"interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected.\" a determination which obviously does not speak in terms of the interests of navigation or water commerce. Plainly the provision does not require a license only where \"the interests of interstate or foreign commerce on navigable waters would be affected.\" Although transportation on interstate waterways is interstate commerce, the phrase \"affect the interests of commerce\" on its face hardly supports any claim that Congress sought to regulate only such transportation. Rather, it strongly implies that Congress drew upon its full authority under the Commerce Clause, including but not limited to its power over water commerce. \"[H]alf a dozen enactments, other than the National Labor Relations Act, are sufficient to illustrate that when [Congress] wants to bring aspects of commerce within the full sweep of its constitutional authority, it manifests its purpose by regulating not only `commerce' but also matters which `affect,' `interrupt,' or `promote' interstate commerce. . . . In so describing the range of its control. Congress is not indulging stylistic preferences.\" Polish National Alliance v. Labor Board, \n322 \nU.S. 643, 647\n.\n\nThe scope of this language is not restricted by the earlier clause in 23 (b) limiting the filing requirements \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 97]\n\u00a0\n to projects on nonnavigable streams \"over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce\" that is, tributaries of river systems necessitating supervisory power to preserve or improve downstream navigability or water commerce generally. See United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690\n; Phillips v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., \n313 \nU.S. 508\n. This language merely designates those who must file a declaration of intention - all those who would locate a water power project on a nonnavigable stream within the jurisdiction of Congress are required to declare their intention so that the Commission may determine the necessity for a license. Congress then proceeds to invoke its full authority over commerce, without qualification, to define what projects on nonnavigable streams are required to be licensed. Respondent asserts that commerce must mean the same thing in both the filing and licensing requirements of 23 (b); because of the allusion to water commerce in the filing provision, the Commission's inquiry into the effect of the project on commerce must be limited to the source of Congress' power over the stream. Nothing in the structure or syntax of 23 (b) compels this conclusion. Indeed, in describing in distinct terms the standard for who must file and what must be licensed,\n9\n the more compelling inference is that Congress intended \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 98]\n\u00a0\n the inquiry into the project's effect on commerce to include, but not be limited to, effect on downstream navigability.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nTurning to the purposes of the Federal Water Power Act, enacted in 1920, we find nothing which casts serious doubt upon our reading of 23 (b) or which indicates that the Commission was to restrict its considerations under 23 (b) to effect on navigability. There is much to indicate the contrary.\n\nThe central purpose of the Federal Water Power Act was to provide for the comprehensive control over those uses of the Nation's water resources in which the Federal Government had a legitimate interest; these uses included navigation, irrigation, flood control, and, very prominently, hydroelectric power - uses which, while unregulated, might well be contradictory rather than harmonious.\n11\n Prior legislation in 1890 and the Rivers and Harbors \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 99]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1899,\n12\n prohibiting the erection of any obstruction to navigation, including those on nonnavigable feeders, United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690\n, and requiring the consent of Congress and approval of the Secretary of War before constructing a bridge, dam, or dike along or in navigable waters, was thought inadequate, for it accommodated only the federal interest in navigation. As this Court has had occasion to note before, the 1920 Federal Water Power Act \"was the outgrowth of a widely supported effort of the conservationists to secure enactment of a complete scheme of national regulation which would promote the comprehensive development of the water resources of the Nation, in so far as it was within the reach of the federal power to do so . . . .\" First Iowa Hydro-Electric Coop. v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n328 \nU.S. 152, 180\n. The principal use to be developed and regulated in the Act, as its title indicates, was that of hydroelectric power to meet the needs of an expanding economy.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe provisions of the Act reflect these objectives. The preface states that besides navigation and the creation of the Commission, the Act was \"to provide for the . . . development of water power; the use of the public lands in relation thereto . . . and for other purposes.\" 41 Stat. 1063. Section 10 (a), as amended, requires as a condition for obtaining a license that the proposed project \"be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce, for the improvement and utilization of water-power development, and for other beneficial public uses . . . .\"\n14\n Other provisions regulate the operations, services, charges, and duration of hydroelectric plants,\n15\n \"provisions . . . not essential to or \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 101]\n\u00a0\n even concerned with navigation as such,\" but which \"have an obvious relationship to the exercise of the commerce power.\" United States v. Appalachian Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377, 424\n, 427. In order to insure comprehensive control over the utilization of the Nation's waterways, \"navigable stream\" was broadly defined to include the interrupting falls shallows, rapids and the waterways authorized by or recommended to Congress for improvement;\n16\n and other recognized sources of federal authority were invoked, such as jurisdiction over public lands and national forests.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nIf the comprehensive development of water power, \"in so far as it was within the reach of the federal power to do so,\" First Iowa Hydro-Electric Coop. v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n328 \nU.S., at 180\n, was the central thrust of the Act, there is obviously little merit to the argument that 23 (b) requires a license when the interests of water commerce are affected but dispenses with the license when other commerce interests are vitally involved. The purposes of the Act are more fully served if the Commission must, as it held in this case, consider the impact of the project on the full spectrum of commerce interests.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nUnion's earnest position, however, is that the legislative history of the Act reveals a more limited purpose and requires a narrower construction of 23 (b). The core of the argument is that the constitutional basis for the Act generally and for 23 (b) in particular was the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 102]\n\u00a0\n authority of Congress over navigation, that Congress invoked only this power, and no other, and that 23 (b) accordingly provides for no greater control over projects on nonnavigable streams than is necessary to protect downstream navigability. On these matters, it is said, both conservationists and opponents of the Act agreed. Moreover, the argument continues, the limited reach of 23 (b) is confined by the repeated references to navigation and to congressional power over it in the course of committee hearings and reports on the 1935 amendments to the Act.\n\nWe cannot distill as much as Union does from the long and intense legislative struggle to enact what was a decided innovation in federal policy. The Act unquestionably involved an invocation of the congressional power over navigation under the Commerce Clause, since it required a license to build any water power project on a navigable stream, broadly defined,\n18\n regardless of any actual effect on navigation. There was, consequently, considerable debate about the scope and extent of the federal power over river navigation, about the definition of \"navigable waters\" and about the authority of Congress to impose controls and conditions having little relevance \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 103]\n\u00a0\n to the protection of navigation.\n19\n Some thought the Commerce Clause did not extend to anything but the navigable mainstream itself, and then only for the purpose of preserving or improving water transportation. This broad objection to the Act found expression in remarks directed at 23 (b) and in assertions that the power over navigation was not sufficient to require the licensing of projects on nonnavigable streams, save perhaps where downstream navigability was substantially affected.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 104]\n\u00a0\n Since the opponents of the Act mounted a major attack on the federal power over navigation, and this was a well-recognized basis of Commerce Clause authority, the proponents defended on this ground. Navigation and federal power over it hence permeated the debates, and statements reflecting the understandings and disagreements \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 105]\n\u00a0\n over these issues understandably constitute a considerable part of the context in which the Act was enacted.\n\nBut none of this history can fairly be said to meet, much less determine, the question presented here. That question is not whether Congress exercised its authority over navigation in the Federal Water Power Act, which it most assuredly did, but whether in enacting 23 (b) it also invoked its full Commerce Clause authority over hydroelectric projects located on waters subject to federal jurisdiction. The fact that there were debates over the extent of federal power over navigation, or over navigable or nonnavigable streams, sheds little light on whether Congress did, or did not, intend to rely on other aspects of its power over commerce when it directed a Commission determination of the effects of a proposed project on the \"interests of commerce.\" It is true that the debates on 23 (b), taking the course that they did, contain no express references to interstate commerce in electrical energy, perhaps because the authority to regulate the production of goods destined for interstate shipment was far less defined and understood at that time, see Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, decided in 1918, and perhaps because no one was inclined to inject other constitutional issues into the ongoing debates.\n21\n But the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 106]\n\u00a0\n Act which emerged from these debates, and 23 (b) in particular, was couched in terms which reached beyond the control of navigation and forms no support for the proposition that Congress intended to equate the \"interests of commerce\" with those of navigation.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nIndeed, this history indicates that Congress was differentiating between the two. The House version of 23 (b) granted permission to construct a dam on a nonnavigable stream and provided for a license if the Commission found the improvement justified for the purpose of improving or developing the waterway \"for the use or benefit of navigation in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n23\n The Senate Committee, along with the expansion of the definition of navigable waters, amended this to require the Commission to make an immediate investigation and to prohibit the construction without a license if the Commission found that \"the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected.\"\n24\n Only if the Commission did not so find was the declarant granted permission to construct upon compliance with state laws. No one offered any explanation for the substitution of the inclusive term \"affect the interests of interstate commerce.\"\n25\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 107]\n\u00a0\n But conservationists and opponents seemed to agree that the Act embodied the full measure of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate hydroelectric projects.\n26\n And there is no evidence that the sponsors of the Act, who prevailed in securing its enactment in the broad terms they drafted, intended a construction of interstate or foreign commerce narrower than their constitutional counterparts. In the face of numerous objections to this exercise of federal authority, we find it of compelling significance that the Congress adopted comprehensive language and refrained from writing any limitation or reference to navigation into 23 (b).\n\nThe materials concerning the 1935 amendments do not alter our conclusion. Here the hearings and reports contained references to navigation and to the federal authority over navigable and nonnavigable streams.\n27\n The House Report, for example, stated that \"every person intending to construct a project which might affect navigation would be required to come to the Commission for a determination of the interests of the United States.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 26. To the same effect, see S. Rep. No. 621, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 108]\n\u00a0\n 46-47. Such statements clearly refer to the filing requirement of 23 (b), which was the subject of the committee amendment. Only persons constructing projects on nonnavigable feeders of navigable waters need file a declaration of intention. The committee statements are thus quite accurate in this respect, but they do not illuminate the licensing provision of 23 (b), as distinct from its filing requirement, nor do they resolve the issue of which projects among those which might affect navigation are required to be licensed. They do not explicitly or implicitly, exempt from licensing those projects having no effect on navigation. The reports do not equate the \"interests of commerce\" with those of water transportation.\n\nIt is true that there are no express references in the reports or the debates to other aspects of the commerce power in connection with 23 (b), but the reports reflect the same broad intent as the earlier deliberations to secure federal control over all water power projects involving the utilization of the Nation's river systems.\n\n \"The act would be greatly strengthened by enabling  the Commission to preserve control over all projects  with which the Federal Government has any valid  concern.\" S. Rep. No. 621, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 47.\n\n\n See also H. R. Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 26. And on the floor of Congress objections to federal control over projects on nonnavigable streams, similar to those voiced in 1920, were again rejected as inconsistent with effective water power regulation. 79 Cong. Rec. 10568. Moreover, there was promptly eliminated an amendment to 23 which would have required a license only when the \"interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be directly affected or burdened by such proposed construction.\"\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 109]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor can we ignore the actual effect of the filing requirement added in 1935. The applicable provision prior to this amendment, 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 30 Stat. 1151, forbidding obstructions to navigation, was adequate to insure that projects with a substantial effect on downstream navigability would be brought before the Commission. Persons intending to construct a project which would likely have no such effect, such as some pure pumped storage installations, could decline to file a declaration of intention with impunity. Thus the 1935 amendment made a difference principally in regard to projects which predictably have little, if any, effect on navigation but a significant effect on interstate commerce. Respondent would have us assume this difference was not intended, although both the Committees stated that the amendment would enable \"the Commission to preserve control over all projects with which the Federal Government has any valid concern.\" S. Rep. No. 621, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 47; H. R. Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 26. In light of the necessary purport of this amendment and the breadth of the federal interest in hydroelectric projects expressed in the 1920 Act, the preoccupation of the Commission and the committees with navigation, while not without significance, does not overcome the clear import of the language and the purposes of the Act.\n\nThe respondent asserts that an anomalous consequence flows from the Commission's construction of the Act and its view that steam plants generating large amounts of energy for interstate transmission are not within the scope of 23 (b), although located along a stream over which Congress has jurisdiction. Since the Commission's jurisdiction here rests solely on the interstate transmission of energy, there can be no basis for distinguishing \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 110]\n\u00a0\n between a steam plant and a hydroelectric facility both generating energy for interstate use. The Court of Appeals, after noting that the generation of electric energy is a local or interstate activity, concluded from this argument that \"[t]he Commission's jurisdiction . . . must logically rest upon its delegated congressional jurisdiction over the interests of commerce on navigable waters.\" 326 F.2d, at 551. On this reasoning either the Act should, but does not, require a license for a steam plant when situated on the navigable mainstream itself, or should not, but does, require a license for a hydroelectric plant, pumped storage or otherwise, situated on the mainstream but which has no demonstrable effect, or a beneficial effect, on navigability. The answer to this conundrum is that unlike Part II of Title II of the Public Utility Act of 1935, under which the Commission regulates various aspects of the sale and transmission of energy in interstate commerce, Part I, the original Federal Water Power Act, is concerned with the utilization of water resources and particularly the power potential in water. In relation to this central concern of the Act,\n29\n the distinction between a hydroelectric project and a steam plant is obvious, and meaningful, although both produce energy for interstate transmission.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 838, 846, 16 U.S.C. 817 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Federal Power Act was originally enacted in 1920 as the Federal Water Power Act, 41 Stat. 1063. The original Act was amended by Title II of the Public Utility Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U.S.C. 791-823 (1958 ed.), and made Part I of the Federal Power Act. Parts II and III, dealing with regulation of electric utility companies, were added. To distinguish the original Federal Water Power Act, which was kept largely intact, from Parts II and III, Part I will be referred to in this opinion under its original title.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] A pumped storage facility may be likened to a large storage battery, taking electric energy from other sources, usually steam-electric plants, during some hours of the day, and supplying energy to an integrated system during other hours. The water in the upper pool may thus be regarded as the equivalent of stored electric energy. Pumped storage installations fall into two categories, those in which pumped storage facilities are added to a conventional hydro installation, and those which are exclusively pumped storage, generating power solely by circulating water between a lower and higher reservoir. Within these categories pumped storage installations vary widely in design and mode of operation. F. P. C., 1964 National Power Survey, Part I, 120-124. Existing combined pumped storage hydroelectric projects include Rocky River, Conn. (1929); Buchanan, Tex. (1950); Flatiron, Colo. (1954); Hiwassee, N.C. (1956); and Lewiston, N. Y. (1961). The pure pumped storage installations are of more recent vintage, with the following projects planned or recently constructed: Yards Creek, N. J.; Cabin Creek, Colo.; Muddy Run, Pa.; Ludington, Mich.; Cornwall, N. Y.; and the Taum Sauk project. See id., at 122-123.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At Taum Sauk the upper reservoir is a 32-acre pool constructed atop a mountain, at about 1,500 feet above sea level, and the lower reservoir, impounded by a 60-foot dam, covers about 370 acres and has a usable storage capacity of 4,350 acre-feet of water. The two \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n are connected by a pressure tunnel and conduit, with a pumping and generating station on an open channel running to the lower pool.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] During normal stream flows and normal operations of the project, there would be no increase or decrease of the natural stage or flow of waters below the dam. In the event of malfunction or abnormal flows, the project might affect the level of both the East Fork and Black River.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The trial examiner found that the Taum Sauk project would affect the navigable capacity of the Black River. Although the Commission directed most of its opinion to the issue of whether the project affected the interests of commerce because a substantial part of its power is transmitted in interstate commerce, it concurred in the examiner's finding that the project may, under certain conditions, affect the navigability of the Black River. The Court of Appeals reversed the latter holding on the ground that the finding was not supported by substantial evidence. The question presented in the petition for certiorari was whether the generation of energy for interstate \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n transmission was a sufficient basis for requiring a license, although the Commission reserved in a footnote the right to argue the correctness of the alternative holding. We do not determine whether this issue is properly here or decide whether there is substantial evidence to support a finding of effect on navigability; our discussion proceeds on the assumption that the Court of Appeals was correct in determining that there was not.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, cited by the Court of Appeals, is not opposed. The Court there held that a State had power to impose a tax on a company generating electric energy for distribution in interstate commerce. This, of course, does not control the commerce powers of Congress. Cf. Edison Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n; Polish Alliance v. Labor Board, \n322 \nU.S. 643, 649\n: \"[F]ederal regulation does not preclude state taxation and state taxation does not preclude federal regulation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 23 (b) reads:\n\n\"It shall be unlawful for any person . . . for the purpose of developing electric power, to construct, operate, or maintain any dam, water conduit, reservoir, power house, or other works incidental thereto across, along, or in any of the navigable waters of the United States, or upon any part of the public lands or reservations of the United States (including the Territories), or utilize the surplus water or water power from any Government dam, except under and in accordance with . . . a license granted pursuant to this Act. Any person . . . intending to construct a dam or other project works across, along, over, or in any stream or part thereof, other than those defined herein as navigable waters, and over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States shall before such construction file declaration of such intention with the Commission, whereupon the Commission shall cause immediate investigation of such proposed construction to be made, and if upon investigation it shall find that the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected by such proposed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n construction, such person . . . shall not construct, maintain, or operate such dam or other project works until it shall have applied for and shall have received a license under the provisions of this Act. If the Commission shall not so find, and if no public lands or reservations are affected, permission is hereby granted to construct such dam or other project works in such stream upon compliance with State laws.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] To be sure the requirement that the project be on a stream over which Congress has jurisdiction delimits the cases in which the Commission need inquire into the project's effect on commerce, leaving the theoretical possibility that some projects affecting commerce need not be licensed because they are located on waters beyond cognizance under the Commerce Clause. But it has not been shown that this possibility is anything more than theoretical. To the extent there are such projects, there is nothing inconsistent between a narrow exemption for projects located on intrastate nonnavigable waters which do not flow into any navigable streams and an intent to reach all projects affecting commerce generally when located on the more typical stream.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Respondent also underscores the statutory directive requiring determination of whether the \"proposed construction\" of the dam or project works would affect commerce and urges that the use of this term indicates the provision refers to effect on navigation. Whether inquiry be limited to such effects or extend to matters affecting the interests of commerce generally, an intelligible determination perforce entails consideration of the nature of the project, its intended use and its mode of operation and not only that of the physical construction. Further, the statute provides that upon finding that the project will have an effect on commerce, the declarant \"shall not construct, maintain, or operate such dam or other project works\" without a license.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] H.

No. 325, 60th Cong., 1st Sess., 25.\n\nThe movement toward the enactment of the Act in 1920 may be said to have taken its keynote from President Roosevelt's veto of a bill which would have turned over to private interests important power sites on the Rainy River. He said:\n\n\"We are now at the beginning of great development in water power. Its use through electrical transmission is entering more and more largely into every element of the daily life of the people. Already \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 99]\n\u00a0\n the evils of monopoly are becoming manifest; already the experience of the past shows the necessity of caution in making unrestricted grants of this great power.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"It should also be the duty of some designated official to see to it that in approving the plans the maximum development of the navigation and power is assured, or at least that in making the plans these may not be so developed as ultimately to interfere with the better utilization of the water or complete development of the power.\" 42 Cong.

And in this purpose may be found the explanation of the strained effort to enlarge the definition of `navigable waters' beyond its proper limits. The proponents of this legislation are not concerned with navigation and so with navigable waters in fact. Theirs is a scheme of power development for the demands and the profits of industry under Federal control. They recognize the impracticability of such developments upon streams navigable in fact and in law, except under unusual and exceptional conditions. . . . Limit this definition of `navigable waters' as we may and the bill even then will go to the very verge of constitutional inhibition. I know of no authority in our fundamental law for the licensing by Congress of corporations and individuals for the building of dams, the erection of power houses, and the generation of electricity for industrial and commercial purposes. There are those who profess to believe that this may be done upon navigable streams as an incident to the improvement of navigation. Whether this view be sound or not, it is clear in my mind that such powers can not be exercised by \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 104]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Government within the limits of our States upon streams which are not navigable and over which Congress has no jurisdiction. . . .\" 59 Cong.

Rec. 1430 (remarks of Senator Nelson).\n\n\n\"Mr. KING. Obviously, then, under the Senator's contention, the Federal Government would have jurisdiction over the snow line, and, as the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Thomas] sotto voce says, it would have jurisdiction of the clouds which produce the snow which melts and produces the spring which produces the tributary flowing into the river which is navigable. So that the Federal Government may stretch out its powerful and omnipotent hand until it can grasp the snow in the mountains and say, `We have jurisdiction over that.'\n\n\n\"Mr. NELSON. That is a forced construction.\n\n\n\"Mr. KING. I think that the Senator's position leads to that.\n\n\n\"Mr. NELSON. It does not lead to that, and that is not my position. The Senator a few moments ago referred to the Rio Grande case. The court intimated incidentally in that opinion that the control of Congress extended to the feeders of the stream, but when it comes to applying the principles of law to the facts in each case they must be measured by the facts. The court did not mean to decide that the feeders were navigable. What the court meant to say was that the Federal Government has sufficient jurisdiction over the feeders to see to it that the supply of water shall not be destroyed or so diminished in the feeders as to prevent the main stream from being navigable. . . .\n\n\n\". . . Does the diversion of the water of a certain feeder of a certain stream for irrigation purposes diminish the quantity of the water to such an extent as to destroy the navigability of the main stream? If the diversion of the water did not diminish the navigability of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 105]\n\u00a0\n main stream, the Government would have no control whatever. Furthermore, it would only have control to the extent of the supply of water needed to subserve the purposes of real navigation.\n\n\n\"We are not seeking to interfere with the present situation, and no matter what we put into this bill, if the Senator from Maine will excuse me a moment longer, we can not change the decisions of the Supreme Court as to their determination of the words `navigable stream.'

Prior to the use of the pumped storage technique, hydroelectric \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 106]\n\u00a0\n projects sufficiently large to serve interstate markets were on the interrupting falls, shallows, and rapids of the navigable mainstream or utilized enough water to affect the flow or level of navigable portions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Indeed, Congress not only invoked its powers over commerce in 23 (b) but also drew upon its powers over public lands and reservations. Only if there is no effect on commerce and \"if no public lands or reservations are affected\" is permission granted to construct without a license.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] H. R. 3184, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. See also S. 1419, 65th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] S. Rep. No. 180, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 19.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] Ibid., H. R. Rep.

The House managers did state in a separate statement in regard to the Senate amendment:\n\n\"This amendment seeks to prescribe how a stream of doubtful navigability \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 107]\n\u00a0\n may be determined as within the provisions of the law, and in substance it provides that the commission shall ascertain whether the interests of commerce are affected; if not, then permission is granted to construct in accordance with the State laws.\" Id., at 13.\n\n\n But whatever the scope of 23 (b), the provision was meant to do more than afford a method for obtaining a determination of the navigability of the stream on which the project was to be located. It applies only if the stream is a nonnavigable stream over which Congress has jurisdiction and the Commission is to determine the effect of the project on commerce, not the nature of the stream.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] See, e. g., 58 Cong. Rec. 1935; 59 Cong. Rec. 241-244, 1173-1174, 1472, 6529-6531, 7723-7729.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] See Hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.

It was deleted \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 109]\n\u00a0\n by the House Committee, also without explanation. H. R. Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 42. The Senate agreed. 79 Cong. Rec. 14473.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] Respondent notes that if the use of water resources is at the heart of the matter, then it cannot be explained why the Act differentiates between two precisely similar hydroelectric plants on a nonnavigable stream subject to federal jurisdiction solely because one transmits energy in interstate commerce and the other generates for local use. We fail to perceive the difficulty. The project located on a nonnavigable stream, without any effect on navigability and water commerce and without any interstate sales, may well have no effect on commerce among the States and thus be beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] The Court of Appeals noted that the Commission's novel construction \"represents a decided departure from its administrative construction of [the] statute\" and \"one not based upon generally \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 111]\n\u00a0\n acknowledged limits of jurisdiction adhered to throughout the years\" 326 F.2d, at 552. Congress must be deemed to have accepted this consistently held administrative view.\n\nIt is true that the FPC has not previously required a license for hydroelectric projects generating for interstate markets, but having no effect on navigability, but the existence of such projects in any number may be doubted. The construction of pure pumped storage installations on small streams is a relatively recent development. Thus pure pumped storage projects were not of significance to the federal interest in hydroelectric plants in the early days of the Act.\n\nFurther, the FPC's view here is not novel. A Court of Appeals expressly dealt with and rejected this construction of the Act in 1939, United States v. Appalachian Power Co., 107 F.2d 769, 793 (C. A. 4th Cir.). There the Court of Appeals held, in a decision relied on by the court below, that the Commission's construction was untenable \"either on the basis of statutory construction or constitutional authority,\" resting this conclusion in part on a very narrow view of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause over hydroelectric projects, whether on navigable or nonnavigable waters. This Court, although finding the stream in question navigable, rejected this underpinning of the Court of Appeals' decision and made quite explicit the broad nature of the federal interest in hydroelectric projects. The Court also expressly put aside the issues posed by the intended interstate sales. \n311 \nU.S. 377\n. Thus the issue herein presented can fairly be said to have been unsettled and unresolved since that decision, as evidenced by an examiner's ruling in 1954 that a project required a license because it would generate energy for interstate transmission. The Commission followed the earlier Court of Appeals' decision and rejected this ruling in a cursory dictum, the project requiring a license on the more traditional ground of effect on navigability. California Oregon Power Co., 13 F. P. C. 1, 3.\n\nThe FPC itself has regarded the question as an open one, stating, in reaching the issue in this case, that \"an issue of such importance must not be allowed to go unresolved any longer since there can be little doubt that this country in the years ahead will become overwhelmingly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 112]\n\u00a0\n more dependent upon the maximum development of its water resources in all their uses.\" 27 F. P. C. 801, 806-807.\n\nWe do not find in these circumstances a generally acknowledged jurisdictional limitation or a consistently held administrative interpretation. See American Trucking Assns. v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 298\n. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the Court that there \"is no question that the interstate transmission of electric energy is fully subject to the commerce powers of Congress,\" and that projects \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 112]\n\u00a0\n generating energy for such transmission, whether they use water or steam, \"are within the purview of the commerce power, quite without regard to the federal control of tributary streams and navigation.\" Ante, at 94. The basic question here presented, however, is one of statutory interpretation: whether Congress exercised fully its commerce power, requiring licenses of those whose projects, built on nonnavigable streams, affect interstate or foreign commerce in any way, or whether Congress wished to require licenses only of those whose projects affect interstate or foreign commerce on navigable waters. From the time the provision in question was enacted in 1920 until 1962 the Federal Power Commission believed the latter interpretation to be correct and did not attempt to require a license unless commerce on navigable waters was affected. In 1962, however, the Commission \"ruled for the first time that [a] hydroelectric project to be constructed in and to utilize nonnavigable waters for the purpose of developing power for interstate use . . . cannot be constructed without an FPC license . . . because it would affect the interests of interstate commerce since the power would be used to supply markets in [other States].\" \"New Regulatory Policies.\" Forty-second Annual Report of the Federal Power Commission 23 (1962).\n1\n I believe that the Commission's earlier interpretation, consistently \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 113]\n\u00a0\n followed for many years, correctly reflected congressional intent.\n\nThe Court's conclusion, supporting the Commission's new theory that a license is required if a project affects the interests of interstate or foreign commerce in any way seems to be based upon an overly literal reading of the statute. The statute provides that a license is required if the Commission finds that \"the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected by such proposed construction.\" With all deference, I do not believe that the interpretation of the Court and the Commission that this language establishes that Congress intended to exercise the full reach of its commerce power can be maintained, for the legislative history of this provision clearly reveals that the \"interests of . . . commerce\" to which Congress refers are the interests of commerce on navigable waters. Statements by congressional proponents of the Federal Water Power Act and others, when the Act was first enacted in 1920, make clear an intent that licensing be required only when interests of commerce on navigable waters are affected.\n2\n Moreover, after a considerable period during which the Commission consistently interpreted the licensing provision in accordance with this congressional intent, the statute was re-enacted in 1935. At that time statements of the drafters of the Act\n3\n and the Senate and House Reports on the Act\n4\n again clearly indicated \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 114]\n\u00a0\n an intent to have the licensing requirement apply only when a project affects interests of commerce on navigable waters.\n\nIt may well be, as the Court intimates, that some of the Act's proponents believed that Congress constitutionally could require licensing only where navigable waters are affected.\n5\n If the legislative history showed an intent to exercise the commerce power to its full extent, notwithstanding doubts as to the reach of this power, I would accept the reading of the statute given by the Court. However, the history, in my view, reveals an express congressional intent to limit the application of the licensing provision to navigable waters irrespective of the scope of the commerce power. There is no indication that anyone envisaged or desired the application of the licensing provision to the type of project here involved which affects interstate commerce only because the electricity produced crosses state lines.\n\nMoreover, to interpret the provision as the Court does today produces a substantial anomaly, for steam generating plants that affect interstate commerce in a manner identical to that of hydroelectric plants such as the one involved here would not be required to obtain a license from the Commission, yet hydroelectric plants would have to obtain one. The Court attempts to explain away this anomaly, by stating that in view of the original Federal Water Power Act's concern with \"the power potential in water,\" \"the distinction between a hydroelectric project and a steam plant is obvious, and meaningful, although both produce energy for interstate transmission.\" Ante, at 110. However, even in terms of the \"power potential in water,\" I fail to find a relevant distinction between a plant which artificially pumps water to an elevated reservoir in off-peak periods allowing it to fall and generate \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 115]\n\u00a0\n electricity at peak periods and a plant which heats water to create steam which generates electricity. I see no purpose of the Act that justifies producing this anomaly in the regulatory scheme. Under my view, of course, when interstate or foreign commerce is affected, Congress can constitutionally require licenses of both steam and hydroelectric projects, of either steam or hydroelectric projects, or of neither. The legislative history here, however, establishes to my satisfaction that it has required licenses of neither steam plants nor the type of hydroelectric plant here involved, and in light of this legislative history I agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress intended that a license be required only where the interests of commerce on navigable waters are affected.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n  APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE    GOLDBERG, DISSENTING.\n\n\n Excerpts from Senate debate on May 27, 1920, 59 Cong. Rec. 7730.\n\n \"Mr. KING. This bill, as I interpret it, would make every stream navigable, even to the headwaters of the smallest stream, or up to the snow line, where the snow melts and finds its way by little trickles and rivulets into some other stream. For instance, this language, if the Senator will pardon me -\n\n\n \"Mr. NELSON. Let me call the attention of the Senator to the first part of the amendment, which reads:\n\n\n  \"`Navigable waters' means those parts of  streams or other bodies of water over which Congress  has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 116]\n\u00a0\n  commerce with foreign nations and among  the several States -\n\n\n \"Mr. KING. The Senator will see that that does not impose any limitation upon the Federal Government as to what it may regulate. When it confers the power to regulate commerce among the States, et cetera, that is not a definition of what commerce is or the extent to which Congress may control streams. The Supreme Court has held, as I understand, that tributaries of tributaries of other tributaries, if any part of such tributary of the final stream was navigable, would be under the cognizance of the Federal Government. That would carry up to the snow line.\n\n\n \"Mr. NELSON. The court's decision only goes to this extent - and the facts in the case must be considered  - that as to the tributaries that supply water to the main stream, which is in fact and in law navigable, Congress of necessity must have sufficient jurisdiction over those feeders to prevent their being dammed up and thereby preventing the supply of water running into the main stream. That is the extent of the decision and the Senator ought to see that that is inevitable, for if all the feeders of our great rivers, such as the Mississippi, the Missouri, and other navigable rivers, could be dammed up so that water would be kept away from them they would cease to be navigable.\n\n\n \"Mr. KING. I am not arguing that question.\n\n\n \"Mr. NELSON. So the Government has jurisdiction to the extent that the supply of water can not be cut off from a navigable stream.\n\n\n \"Mr. KING. Obviously, then, under the Senator's contention, the Federal Government would have jurisdiction over the snow line, and, as the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Thomas) sotto voce says, it \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 117]\n\u00a0\n would have jurisdiction of the clouds which produce the snow which melts and produces the spring which produces the tributary flowing into the river which is navigable. So that the Federal Government may stretch out its powerful and omnipotent hand until it can grasp the snow in the mountains and say, `We have jurisdiction over that.'\n\n\n \"Mr. NELSON. That is a forced construction.\n\n\n \"Mr. KING. I think that the Senator's position leads to that.\n\n\n \"Mr. NELSON. It does not lead to that, and that is not my position. The Senator a few moments ago referred to the Rio Grande case. The court intimated incidentally in that opinion that the control of Congress extended to the feeders of the stream, but when it comes to applying the principles of law to the facts. in each case they must be measured by the facts. The court did not mean to decide that the feeders were navigable. What the court meant to say was that the Federal Government has sufficient jurisdiction over the feeders to see to it that the supply of water shall not be destroyed or so diminished in the feeders as to prevent the main stream from being navigable. The Senator on reflection ought to see that if the Government had no control whatever of the feeders - if such a thing were possible, although I can not conceive it - if it were possible for the States or individuals to dam up the feeders and prevent a drop of water flowing into the main navigable stream, they could dry up the main stream and destroy navigation on it. Except in those sections where the water is exhausted for irrigation, the erection of dams in feeders, as a matter of fact, for instance, in the East and in the Middle West, does not diminish the supply of water, for the water flows over the dam in one way or another and enters the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 118]\n\u00a0\n feeders and then the main stream. It is only in the arid West where it is possible to divert water entirely for irrigation purposes from the main stream.\n\n\n \"To what extent can that be done? I take it that if a case of that kind should come before the court, the court would consider both the rights of the farmers, who needed the water for irrigation, and the interests of commerce requiring water for navigation, and the question would be one of fact in each case. Does the diversion of the water of a certain feeder of a certain stream for irrigation purposes diminish the quantity of the water to such an extent as to destroy the navigability of the main stream? If the diversion of the water did not diminish the navigability of the main stream, the Government would have no control whatever. Furthermore, it would only have control to the extent of the supply of water needed to subserve the purposes of real navigation.\n\n\n \"We are not seeking to interfere with the present situation, and no matter what we put into this bill, if the Senator from Maine will excuse me a moment longer, we can not change the decisions of the Supreme Court as to their determination of the words `navigable stream.' We could not undo by this legislation, if we should make the effort, what they have decided. We have made no such attempt. We have simply said that those parts of streams or bodies of water over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, and which in either their natural or improved conditions, and so forth, are navigable, shall be considered to be navigable streams. That is all we have said. We have simply left the matter where the courts have left it; and if we undertook to change the law as it is and to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 119]\n\u00a0\n say that a certain class of streams which are navigable in fact are not navigable the Supreme Court would overrule us.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n  APPENDIX B TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE    GOLDBERG, DISSENTING.\n\n\n A memorandum prepared by the Federal Power Commission and submitted to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce explaining the amendments to the Federal Water Power Act states:\n\n \"Section 210 of the bill amends section 23 of the Water Power Act. . . In subsection (b) the present provision that those intending to undertake projects on a nonnavigable tributary of a navigable stream may in their discretion file declaration of such intention with the Commission is changed so as to make it a duty to file such a declaration before proceeding with the construction, maintenance or operation of any project on such waters. Furthermore, a provision is inserted expressly making it unlawful to construct a project on any navigable waters without a license granted pursuant to the act. This latter provision is in substance the result achieved by the River and Harbor Act of 1899 when read with the Water Power Act. It is thought desirable to bring together the regulations dealing with power projects in a single act. Under this section as amended, every person intending to construct a project which might conceivably affect any navigable waters would be under the duty of coming to the Commission. The act would be greatly strengthened by enabling the Commission to preserve control over all projects with which the Federal Government has any valid concern.\" Hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 391. (Emphasis added.) \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Dozier DeVane, Solicitor for the Federal Power Commission, testified as follows concerning the amendments which the Commission had prepared:\n\n \"Mr. MARTIN. Although it may be rather in the form of repetition, the memorandum impresses me that the contention of Mr. Mapes in section 3 is broader, from the standpoint of commerce in the way of a power, than the language in section 4.\n\n\n \"It occurred to me that you could just leave those words `navigable waters in the United States' in the section and then add as defined in section 3.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. No, sir; what we are attempting to do is to make it clear that the Commission has the authority to issue [a] license under section 4 in cases that arise under section 23 of the act.\n\n\n \"Mr. MARTIN. The addition of the words defined in section 3, added to `navigable waters of the United States,' however, would incorporate the section 3 definition of navigable waters.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Of course, we think it exists without that amendment.\n\n\n \"Mr. Ryan calls my attention to the fact that section 3 might be considered to apply only to navigable waters. while section 23 applies to nonnavigable waters as well.\n\n\n \"The jurisdiction of Congress extends beyond the navigable waters. It extends to nonnavigable waters where anything you do in those rivers or streams might affect navigation and those are the cases which fall under section 23 of the act.\n\n\n \"Mr. CROSSER. What was that last statement? I did not quite hear it.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Section 23 applies to nonnavigable waters, where anything that is done in those waters might affect interstate or foreign commerce. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 121]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The CHAIRMAN. I think the committee has your position on that. You may pass on.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. Does the Commission arrive at its conclusion, reach about the same conclusion, as to whether a plant should obtain the license or not, as Congress and the Board of Engineers do when they determine that a stream is navigable and that, therefore, people who desire to build a bridge across it. must get the consent of Congress to do it?\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. The Commission in the first instance refers these declarations of intention to the War Department, the Engineer Corps of the War Department, and an investigation and recommendation is made by that Department, with reference to the effect upon interstate or foreign commerce, and the Commission, if it is necessary after that investigation and report is made, holds hearings, takes evidence, and makes its findings.\n\n\n \"The Commission attempts to act according to the facts as they are shown. In very few of the cases is there ever any controversy.\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. Are these two expressions synonymous, or not: the effect upon interstate commerce, and the navigability of a stream?\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Mr. Mapes, I think they are. Do you want to hear argument on the other side as to whether they are or not?\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. No.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. I see that you have some knowledge at least of the fact that that question has been debated, but to me it is a question of `tweedledee and tweedledum.' I cannot take my legal processes to that refinement. There may be a difference; yes, sir. It is conceivable, at least in somebody's mind, that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 122]\n\u00a0\n the construction of a project in a certain stream will not at the time in fact have any effect upon interstate or foreign commerce, but that the construction of the project has a potential possibility of affecting interstate or foreign commerce at some future time which will prevent a man from spending money to put commerce on that stream.\n\n\n \"Now that is the way the argument runs.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. We are not seeking by any amendment that we propose to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Commission in the waters of the United States over which Congress has control.\n\n\n \"Mr. HOLMES. I understood you to say you were, so that you could control other than navigable waters.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. That is the law today.\n\n\n \"Mr. HOLMES. Then I misunderstood you in that regard.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Well, I would like to make that perfectly clear.\n\n\n \"We are not extending the power. We are not proposing any amendment that extends the power of the Commission over any waters of the United States that they do not have power over today - not at all.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"At this point, Mr. Mapes, I think we might clear up the difficulty that I had in answering a question that you asked me on Saturday.\n\n\n \"You will observe that under subsection (b) of section 23, persons desiring to construct projects in waters over which Congress has jurisdiction, but which may not be looked upon as navigable waters, as such, may come to the Commission under a declaration of intention and have determined in advance of the construction whether or not a license is necessary. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 90, 123]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"That provision in section 23 is broader than the language in section 3, where the definition of navigable waters is used, the one that you were asking me about, on Saturday.\n\n\n \"The definition of navigable waters in section 3 applies only to those waters that are in fact navigable.\n\n\n \"Section 23 applies to waters that are not in fact navigable, but where construction may affect interstate or foreign commerce.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. Yes. Has the court sustained the Commission in that respect, the jurisdiction of the Commission?\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Of nonnavigable waters?\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. Yes.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. You are asking about the jurisdiction of Congress over these nonnavigable waters, that affect navigation?\n\n\n \"Mr. MAPES. Yes.\n\n\n \"Mr. DeVANE. Yes; the jurisdiction of Congress over such streams was upheld in the case of the United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690\n.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellant sought to challenge the constitutionality of the Maryland motion picture censorship statute, Md. Ann. Code, 1957, Art. 66A, and exhibited the film \"Revenge at Daybreak\" at his Baltimore theatre without first submitting the picture to the State Board of Censors as required by 2 thereof.\n1\n The State concedes that the picture does not violate the statutory standards\n2\n and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n would have received a license if properly submitted, but the appellant was convicted of a 2 violation despite his contention that the statute in its entirety unconstitutionally impaired freedom of expression. The Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed, 233 Md. 498, 197 A. 2d 232, and we noted probable jurisdiction, \n377 \nU.S. 987\n. We reverse.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago, \n365 \nU.S. 43\n, we considered and upheld a requirement of submission of motion pictures in advance of exhibition. The Court of Appeals held, on the authority of that decision, that \"the Maryland censorship law must be held to be not void on its face as violative of the freedoms protected against State action by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" 233 Md., at 505, 197 A. 2d, at 235. This reliance on Times Film was misplaced. The only question tendered for decision in that case was \"whether a prior restraint was necessarily unconstitutional under all circumstances.\" Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, \n372 \nU.S. 58, 70\n, n. 10 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n (emphasis in original). The exhibitor's argument that the requirement of submission without more amounted to a constitutionally prohibited prior restraint was interpreted by the Court in Times Film as a contention that the \"constitutional protection includes complete and absolute freedom to exhibit, at least once, any and every kind of motion picture . . . even if this film contains the basest type of pornography, or incitement to riot, or forceful overthrow of orderly government . . . .\" \n365 \nU.S., at 46\n, 47. The Court held that on this \"narrow\" question, id., at 46, the argument stated the principle against prior restraints too broadly; citing a number of our decisions, the Court quoted the statement from Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 716\n, that \"the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited.\" In rejecting the proffered proposition in Times Film the Court emphasized, however, that \"[i]t is that question alone which we decide,\" \n365 \nU.S., at 46\n, and it would therefore be inaccurate to say that Times Film upheld the specific features of the Chicago censorship ordinance.\n\nUnlike the petitioner in Times Film, appellant does not argue that 2 is unconstitutional simply because it may prevent even the first showing of a film whose exhibition may legitimately be the subject of an obscenity prosecution. He presents a question quite distinct from that passed on in Times Film; accepting the rule in Times Film, he argues that 2 constitutes an invalid prior restraint because, in the context of the remainder of the statute, it presents a danger of unduly suppressing protected expression. He focuses particularly on the procedure for an initial decision by the censorship board, which, without any judicial participation, effectively bars exhibition of any disapproved film, unless and until the exhibitor undertakes a time-consuming appeal to the Maryland courts and succeeds in having the Board's decision \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n reversed. Under the statute, the exhibitor is required to submit the film to the Board for examination, but no time limit is imposed for completion of Board action, 17. If the film is disapproved, or any elimination ordered, 19 provides that\n\n\"the person submitting such film or view for examination will receive immediate notice of such elimination or disapproval, and if appealed from, such film or view will be promptly re-examined, in the presence of such person, by two or more members of the Board, and the same finally approved or disapproved promptly after such re-examination, with the right of appeal from the decision of the Board to the Baltimore City Court of Baltimore City. There shall be a further right of appeal from the decision of the Baltimore City Court to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, subject generally to the time and manner provided for taking appeal to the Court of Appeals.\"\n\n\n Thus there is no statutory provision for judicial participation in the procedure which bars a film, nor even assurance of prompt judicial review. Risk of delay is built into the Maryland procedure, as is borne out by experience; in the only reported case indicating the length of time required to complete an appeal, the initial judicial determination has taken four months and final vindication of the film on appellate review, six months. United Artists Corp. v. Maryland State Board of Censors, 210 Md. 586, 124 A. 2d 292.\n\nIn the light of the difference between the issues presented here and in Times Film, the Court of Appeals erred in saying that, since appellant's refusal to submit the film to the Board was a violation only of 2, \"he has restricted himself to an attack on that section \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n alone, and lacks standing to challenge any of the other provisions (or alleged shortcomings) of the statute.\" 233 Md., at 505, 197 A. 2d, at 236. Appellant has not challenged the submission requirement in a vacuum but in a concrete statutory context. His contention is that 2 effects an invalid prior restraint because the structure of the other provisions of the statute contributes to the infirmity of 2; he does not assert that the other provisions are independently invalid.\n\nIn the area of freedom of expression it is well established that one has standing to challenge a statute on the ground that it delegates overly broad licensing discretion to an administrative office, whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly drawn statute, and whether or not he applied for a license. \"One who might have had a license for the asking may . . . call into question the whole scheme of licensing when he is prosecuted for failure to procure it.\" Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 97\n; see Staub v. City of Baxley, \n355 \nU.S. 313, 319\n; Saia v. New York, \n334 \nU.S. 558\n; Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516\n; Hague v. CIO, \n307 \nU.S. 496\n; Lovell v. City of Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 452\n-453. Standing is recognized in such cases because of the \". . . danger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application.\" NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 433\n; see also Amsterdam, Note. The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 67, 75-76, 80-81, 96-104 (1960). Although we have no occasion to decide whether the vice of overbroadness infects the Maryland statute,\n3\n we think that appellant's assertion of a similar \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n danger in the Maryland apparatus of censorship - one always fraught with danger and viewed with suspicion - gives him standing to make that challenge. In substance his argument is that, because the apparatus operates in a statutory context in which judicial review may be too little and too late, the Maryland statute lacks sufficient safeguards for confining the censor's action to judicially determined constitutional limits, and therefore contains the same vice as a statute delegating excessive administrative discretion.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Court has said that motion pictures are not \"necessarily subject to the precise rules governing any other particular method of expression,\" Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495, 503\n, it is as true here as of other forms of expression that \"[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\" Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra, at 70. \". . . [U]nder the Fourteenth Amendment, a State is not free to adopt whatever procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity . . . without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech.\" Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717, 731\n. The administration of a censorship system for motion pictures presents peculiar dangers to constitutionally protected speech. Unlike a prosecution for obscenity, a censorship proceeding puts the initial burden on the exhibitor or distributor. Because the censor's business is to censor, there inheres the danger that he may well be less responsive than a court - part of an independent branch of government - to the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n constitutionally protected interests in free expression.\n4\n And if it is made unduly onerous, by reason of delay or otherwise, to seek judicial review, the censor's determination may in practice be final.\n\nApplying the settled rule of our cases, we hold that a noncriminal process which requires the prior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional infirmity only if it takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system. First, the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor. As we said in Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 526\n, \"Where the transcendent value of speech is involved, due process certainly requires . . . that the State bear the burden of persuasion to show that the appellants engaged in criminal speech.\" Second, while the State may require advance submission of all films, in order to proceed effectively to bar all showings of unprotected films, the requirement cannot be administered in a manner which would lend an effect of finality to the censor's determination whether a film constitutes protected expression. The teaching of our cases is that, because only a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding ensures the necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression, only a procedure requiring a judicial determination suffices to impose a valid final restraint. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra; A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, \n378 \nU.S. 205\n; Marcus v. Search Warrant, supra; Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, \n370 \nU.S. 478, 518\n-519. To this end, the exhibitor must be assured, by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n statute or authoritative judicial construction, that the censor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court to restrain showing the film. Any restraint imposed in advance of a final judicial determination on the merits must similarly be limited to preservation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution. Moreover, we are well aware that, even after expiration of a temporary restraint, an administrative refusal to license, signifying the censor's view that the film is unprotected, may have a discouraging effect on the exhibitor. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra. Therefore, the procedure must also assure a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license.\n\nWithout these safeguards, it may prove too burdensome to seek review of the censor's determination. Particularly in the case of motion pictures, it may take very little to deter exhibition in a given locality. The exhibitor's stake in any one picture may be insufficient to warrant a protracted and onerous course of litigation. The distributor, on the other hand, may be equally unwilling to accept the burdens and delays of litigation in a particular area when, without such difficulties, he can freely exhibit his film in most of the rest of the country; for we are told that only four States and a handful of municipalities have active censorship laws.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIt is readily apparent that the Maryland procedural scheme does not satisfy these criteria. First, once the censor disapproves the film, the exhibitor must assume \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 60]\n\u00a0\n the burden of instituting judicial proceedings and of persuading the courts that the film is protected expression. Second, once the Board has acted against a film, exhibition is prohibited pending judicial review, however protracted. Under the statute, appellant could have been convicted if he had shown the film after unsuccessfully seeking a license, even though no court had ever ruled on the obscenity of the film. Third, it is abundantly clear that the Maryland statute provides no assurance of prompt judicial determination. We hold, therefore, that appellant's conviction must be reversed. The Maryland scheme fails to provide adequate safeguards against undue inhibition of protected expression, and this renders the 2 requirement of prior submission of films to the Board an invalid previous restraint.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nHow or whether Maryland is to incorporate the required procedural safeguards in the statutory scheme is, of course, for the State to decide. But a model is not lacking: In Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, \n354 \nU.S. 436\n, we upheld a New York injunctive procedure designed to prevent the sale of obscene books. That procedure postpones any restraint against sale until a judicial determination of obscenity following notice and an adversary hearing. The statute provides for a hearing one day after joinder of issue; the judge must hand down his decision within two days after termination of the hearing. The New York procedure operates without prior submission to a censor, but the chilling effect of a censorship order, even one which requires judicial action for its enforcement, suggests all the more reason for expeditious determination of the question whether a particular film is constitutionally protected.\n\nThe requirement of prior submission to a censor sustained in Times Film is consistent with our recognition \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 61]\n\u00a0\n that films differ from other forms of expression. Similarly, we think that the nature of the motion picture industry may suggest different time limits for a judicial determination. It is common knowledge that films are scheduled well before actual exhibition, and the requirement of advance submission in 2 recognizes this. One possible scheme would be to allow the exhibitor or distributor to submit his film early enough to ensure an orderly final disposition of the case before the scheduled exhibition date - far enough in advance so that the exhibitor could safely advertise the opening on a normal basis. Failing such a scheme or sufficiently early submission under such a scheme, the statute would have to require adjudication considerably more prompt than has been the case under the Maryland statute. Otherwise, litigation might be unduly expensive and protracted, or the victorious exhibitor might find the most propitious opportunity for exhibition past. We do not mean to lay down rigid time limits or procedures, but to suggest considerations in drafting legislation to accord with local exhibition practices, and in doing so to avoid the potentially chilling effect of the Maryland statute on protected expression.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Md.

This is well illustrated by the fact that the Maryland Court of Appeals has reversed the Board's disapproval in every reported case. United Artists Corp. v.

JUSTICE BLACK joins, concurring.\n\nOn several occasions I have indicated my view that movies are entitled to the same degree and kind of protection under the First Amendment as other forms of expression. Superior Films v. Department of Education, \n346 \nU.S. 587, 588\n; Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents, \n360 \nU.S. 684, 697\n; Times Film Corp. v. Chicago, \n365 \nU.S. 43, 78\n.\n*\n For the reasons there stated, I do not \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 62]\n\u00a0\n believe any form of censorship - no matter how speedy or prolonged it may be - is permissible. As I see it, a pictorial presentation occupies as preferred a position as any other form of expression. If censors are banned from the publishing business, from the pulpit, from the public platform - as they are - they should be banned from the theatre. I would not admit the censor even for the limited role accorded him in Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, \n354 \nU.S. 436\n. I adhere to my dissent in that case. Id., at 446-447. Any authority to obtain a temporary injunction gives the State \"the paralyzing power of a censor.\" Id., at 446. The regime of Kingsley Books \"substitutes punishment by contempt for punishment by jury trial.\" Id., at 447. I would put an end to all forms and types of censorship and give full literal meaning to the command of the First Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The Court today holds that a system of movie censorship must contain at least three procedural safeguards if it is not to run afoul \n\n[380 \nU.S. 51, 62]\n\u00a0\n of the First Amendment: (1) the censor must have the burden of instituting judicial proceedings; (2) any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only briefly in order to preserve the status quo; and (3) a prompt judicial determination of obscenity must be assured. Thus the Chicago censorship system, upheld by the narrowest of margins in Times Film Corp. v. Chicago, \n365 \nU.S. 43\n, could not survive under today's standards, for it provided not one of these safeguards, as the dissenters there expressly pointed out.

COLGATE-PALMOLIVE CO.(1965)\nNo. 62\nArgued: December 10, 1964Decided: April 5, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The Federal Trade Commission charged respondents, an advertiser and an advertising agency, with using commercials that were deceptive within the meaning of 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The commercials purported to give viewers visual proof that the advertiser's shaving cream could soften \"sandpaper,\" but unknown to viewers the substance that appeared to be sandpaper in the commercials was in fact a simulated prop, or \"mock-up,\" made of plexiglass to which sand had been applied. After a hearing, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against respondents that could be interpreted to forbid all use of undisclosed simulations in television commercials. The Court of Appeals set aside the order as too broad. Five months later the Commission issued a revised order prohibiting respondents from presenting advertisements depicting a test, experiment or demonstration represented as actual proof of a product claim but not in fact constituting actual proof because of the undisclosed use of a prop or mock-up. From the court's judgment setting aside that order the Commission petitioned this Court for certiorari. Held:\n\n 1. The 90-day period allowed for filing a petition for certiorari by 28 U.S.C. 2101 (c) commenced on the date of the second judgment by the Court of Appeals since the Commission's second order was a good-faith attempt to incorporate the legal principles contained in the court's first mandate and, at the least, the court's second opinion resolved a genuine ambiguity in the first. Pp. 378-384.\n\n\n 2. It is a material deceptive practice to convey to television viewers the false impression that they are seeing an actual test, experiment or demonstration which proves a product claim when they are not because of the undisclosed use of mock-ups. Pp. 384-392.\n\n\n  (a) The FTC's judgment as to what constitutes a deceptive practice is to be accorded great weight by reviewing courts, and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 375]\n\u00a0\n this admonition is especially true with respect to allegedly deceptive advertising since the finding of a 5 violation in this field rests so heavily on inference and pragmatic judgment. P. 385.\n\n\n  (b) The misrepresentation of any fact so long as it materially induces a purchaser's decision to buy is a deception prohibited by 5. P. 387.\n\n\n 3. The order issued in this case was well within the Commission's wide discretion to determine the type of order necessary to cope with the unfair practices found. Pp. 392-395.\n\n\n  (a) The crucial terms of the present order are as specific as the circumstances will permit. P. 393.\n\n\n  (b) In borderline situations the respondents can oblige the FTC to advise them whether a contemplated commercial complies with the order. P. 394.\n\n\n  (c) Since the respondents produced three different commercials which employed the same deceptive practice, the Commission had a sufficient basis for believing that the respondents would be inclined to use similar commercials with respect to other products they advertise. P. 395.\n\n\n 326 F.2d 517, reversed and remanded.\n\nPhilip B. Heymann argued the cause for petitioner.

Allen.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging affirmance, were filed by Mahlon F. Perkins, Jr., for the American Association of Advertising Agencies, Inc., and by Gilbert H. Weil for the Association of National Advertisers, Inc.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe basic question before us is whether it is a deceptive trade practice, prohibited by 5 of the Federal Trade \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 376]\n\u00a0\n Commission Act,\n1\n to represent falsely that a televised test, experiment, or demonstration provides a viewer with visual proof of a product claim, regardless of whether the product claim is itself true.\n\nThe case arises out of an attempt by respondent Colgate-Palmolive Company to prove to the television public that its shaving cream, \"Rapid Shave,\" outshaves them all. Respondent Ted Bates & Company, Inc., an advertising agency, prepared for Colgate three one-minute commercials designed to show that Rapid Shave could soften even the toughness of sandpaper. Each of the commercials contained the same \"sandpaper test.\" The announcer informed the audience that, \"To prove RAPID SHAVE'S super-moisturizing power, we put it right from the can onto this tough, dry sandpaper. It was apply . . . soak . . . and off in a stroke.\" While the announcer was speaking, Rapid Shave was applied to a substance that appeared to be sandpaper, and immediately thereafter a razor was shown shaving the substance clean.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint against respondents Colgate and Bates charging that the commercials were false and deceptive. The evidence before the hearing examiner disclosed that sandpaper of the type depicted in the commercials could not be shaved immediately following the application of Rapid Shave, but required a substantial soaking period of approximately 80 minutes. The evidence also showed that the substance resembling sandpaper was in fact a simulated prop, or \"mock-up,\" made of plexiglass to which sand had been applied. However, the examiner found that Rapid Shave could shave sandpaper, even though not in the short time represented by the commercials, and that if \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 377]\n\u00a0\n real sandpaper had been used in the commercials the inadequacies of television transmission would have made it appear to viewers to be nothing more than plain, colored paper. The examiner dismissed the complaint because neither misrepresentation - concerning the actual moistening time or the identity of the shaved substance - was in his opinion a material one that would mislead the public.\n\nThe Commission, in an opinion dated December 29, 1961, reversed the hearing examiner. It found that since Rapid Shave could not shave sandpaper within the time depicted in the commercials, respondents had misrepresented the product's moisturizing power. Moreover, the Commission found that the undisclosed use of a plexiglass substitute for sandpaper was an additional material misrepresentation that was a deceptive act separate and distinct from the misrepresentation concerning Rapid Shave's underlying qualities. Even if the sandpaper could be shaved just as depicted in the commercials, the Commission found that viewers had been misled into believing they had seen it done with their own eyes. As a result of these findings the Commission entered a cease-and-desist order against the respondents.\n\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which rendered an opinion on November 20, 1962. That court sustained the Commission's conclusion that respondents had misrepresented the qualities of Rapid Shave, but it would not accept the Commission's order forbidding the future use of undisclosed simulations in television commercials. It set aside the Commission's order and directed that a new order be entered. On May 7, 1963, the Commission, over the protest of respondents, issued a new order narrowing and clarifying its original order to comply with the court's mandate. The Court of Appeals again found unsatisfactory that portion of the order dealing with simulated props and refused to enforce \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 378]\n\u00a0\n it. We granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 942\n, to consider this aspect of the case and do not have before us any question concerning the misrepresentation that Rapid Shave could shave sandpaper immediately after application, that being conceded.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nA threshold question presented is whether the petition for certiorari was filed within 90 days after the entry of the judgment below as required by 28 U.S.C. 2101 (c) (1958 ed.). Respondents claim that the failure of the Commission to seek certiorari from the judgment of the Court of Appeals rendered on November 20, 1962, barred a subsequent order prohibiting the use of simulated props in commercials that offer visual proof of a product claim.\n\nAfter a court of appeals has set aside an order of the Commission on a point of law, the Commission may seek certiorari if it disagrees with the court's legal conclusion. Section 5 (i) of the Federal Trade Commission Act\n2\n contemplates that when the time for filing a petition for certiorari has passed without a petition being filed, the Commission will enter an order in accordance with the mandate of the court of appeals. The Commission may not merely restate its former position in a new order and then apply for certiorari when the court of appeals reiterates \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 379]\n\u00a0\n its previous objection. As was said in Federal Power Comm'n v. Idaho Power Co., \n344 \nU.S. 17, 20\n, \"If the court did no more by the second judgment than to restate what it had decided by the first one . . . the 90 days would start to run from the first judgment.\" To the same effect see Federal Trade Comm'n v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., \n344 \nU.S. 206, 211\n. However, it has also been held that when a reviewing court finds a legal error in an administrative order, the agency is not foreclosed upon the remand of the case from enforcing the legislative policy of the act it administers, provided the new order does not conflict with the reviewing court's mandate.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nObviously, the court which drafted the mandate is normally in the best position to determine whether the Commission's subsequent order is consistent with the mandate, but this Court is never foreclosed from determining the issue for itself.\n4\n The resolution of this issue in the present case requires a detailed analysis of the various opinions, mandates and orders issued by the Commission and the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn its initial opinion, dated December 29, 1961, the Commission commented that the heart of the commercials was the visual \"sandpaper test\" which was designed to leave the viewer with the impression that he had actually seen such an experiment being performed. The Commission expressed the view that without this visible proof of Rapid Shave's moisturizing ability some viewers might not have been persuaded to buy the product. The Commission then entered into a far-reaching discussion on the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 380]\n\u00a0\n use of mock-ups in television and the relationship between \"truth\" and \"television salesmanship,\" and finally concluded that the use of the plexiglass prop was a deceptive practice. The Commission's order was as inclusive as its discussion. It ordered both respondents to cease and desist from:\n\n  \"Representing, directly or by implication, in describing, explaining, or purporting to prove the quality or merits of any product, that pictures, depictions, or demonstrations . . . are genuine or accurate representations . . . of, or prove the quality or merits of, any product, when such pictures, depictions, or demonstrations are not in fact genuine or accurate representations . . . of, or do not prove the quality or merits of, any such product.\"\n5\n (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The Court of Appeals understandably was concerned with the broad language in the Commission's opinion and order, especially since the Commission was not dealing with an established deceptive practice but was applying the flexible standards of 5 to a hitherto unexplored area. The breadth of the Commission's order was potentially limitless, apparently establishing a per se rule prohibiting the use of simulated props in all television commercials, since commercials by definition describe \"the qualities or merits\" of products. The court's impression that the order was \"quite ambiguous\" was not alleviated when in oral argument counsel for the Commission stated that if a prominent person appeared on television saying \"I love Lipsom's iced tea,\" while drinking something that appeared to be tea but in fact was not, the commercial would be a deceptive practice. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the Commission's order and its oral argument, the court concluded that it was the Commission's intention to prohibit all simulated props in television commercials. The court could not agree with this position since it believed that \"where the only untruth is that the substance [the viewer] sees on the screen is artificial, and the visual appearance is otherwise a correct and accurate representation of the product itself, he is not injured.\"\n6\n But, in setting aside the Commission's order, the court gave little specific guidance for the drafting of a new one. It merely criticized the Commission for holding that mock-ups are \"illegal per se,\"\n7\n and indicated that the Commission's order \"may\" have been too broad in other respects as well.\n\nFollowing the decision by the Court of Appeals, the Commission entered a new \"proposed final order\" on February 18, 1963. This order was accompanied by an explanatory opinion that admitted error in the original disposition of the case and expressed an intention to eliminate the errors found by the Court of Appeals. The Commission explained that its new order was not directed toward the broad prohibition of all undisclosed simulated props in commercials, but merely toward prohibiting respondents from misrepresenting to the public that it was seeing for itself a test, experiment or demonstration which purportedly proved a product claim. According to the Commission, the television commercial in question did not merely tell viewers that the experiment had been or could be performed, but instead told them that they were seeing it for themselves and did not have to take the seller's word for it. This, and not the mere use of a prop, was the misrepresentation found to be a deceptive practice. Over the vigorous objection of respondents, the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 382]\n\u00a0\n Commission issued its final order on May 7, 1963. Both respondents were ordered to cease and desist from:\n\n \"Unfairly or deceptively advertising any . . . product by presenting a test, experiment or demonstration that (1) is represented to the public as actual proof of a claim made for the product which is material to inducing its sale, and (2) is not in fact a genuine test, experiment or demonstration being conducted as represented and does not in fact constitute actual proof of the claim, because of the undisclosed use and substitution of a mock-up or prop instead of the product, article, or substance represented to be used therein.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n Respondents again appealed to the Court of Appeals. Despite the urgings of respondents that it limit its review to a determination whether the Commission's order was consistent with the previous mandate, the court re-examined the Commission's new order on the merits. The court recognized that the new order no longer prohibited the use of all simulated props in commercials, but found that it would be impossible under it to distinguish between commercials which depicted a test, experiment or demonstration, and those which did not. The court held that so long as there is an accurate portrayal of a product's attributes or performance there is no deceit and instructed the Commission, \"as we thought we had directed it before,\"\n9\n to enter an order merely prohibiting respondents \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 383]\n\u00a0\n from using mock-ups to demonstrate something which in fact could not be accomplished.\n\nWe hold that the Commission's order of May 7, 1963, was not in disregard of the Court of Appeals' first mandate and was a good-faith attempt to incorporate the legal principles contained therein. An examination of the Commission's first order and accompanying opinion shows an overriding emphasis on mock-ups as such and a failure to articulate with precision the actual deceptive practice found. As a result, it is not surprising that the court criticized the order as \"ambiguous,\" interpreted it as prohibiting the substitution of a mock-up for a product in any commercial, and found that it rested on a premise that mock-ups were \"illegal per se.\" It is true that the court also said that viewers are interested in what they see and not in the means by which they see it, but this statement occurred immediately after the court discussed the contention in oral argument that it would be a deceptive practice to represent that a person was drinking \"Lipsom's iced tea\" when in fact he was not. The only clear directive in the court's mandate was for the Commission to remove the \"fundamental error [which] so permeates the order\"\n10\n - i. e., the error that every use of mock-ups is a deceptive practice.\n\nWe find it inconceivable that the Commission could have successfully sought certiorari from this judgment. Had it done so, it would have been forced to argue either that every use of mock-ups in commercials is a deceptive practice, an apparently unintended theory, or that this Court should reinstate the Commission's decision on a theory of its own, something the Court said it would not do in Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 196\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSupport is given our conclusion by the refusal of the Court of Appeals to declare that the Commission's subsequent order was inconsistent with the previous mandate. However, even if the first opinion of the Court of Appeals could somehow be construed to hold as a matter of law that it is never a deceptive practice to use undisclosed props in a commercial designed to convince a viewer that he is seeing for himself proof of a seller's claims, we find that the Commission acted reasonably in construing the mandate more narrowly. The Commission's vague first order had spawned a correspondingly vague opinion by the Court of Appeals. If the court meant its first opinion to say more than we have attributed to it, it was not until the second opinion that the court clearly articulated its reasoning. Therefore, at the least the court's second opinion resolved a genuine ambiguity in the first, and the time within which certiorari had to be requested dates from the second judgment. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., \n344 \nU.S. 206, 211\n.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nIn reviewing the substantive issues in the case, it is well to remember the respective roles of the Commission and the courts in the administration of the Federal Trade Commission Act. When the Commission was created by Congress in 1914, it was directed by 5 to prevent \"[u]nfair methods of competition in commerce.\"\n11\n Congress amended the Act in 1938 to extend the Commission's jurisdiction to include \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce\"\n12\n - a significant amendment showing Congress' concern for consumers as well as for competitors. It is important to note the generality of these \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 385]\n\u00a0\n standards of illegality; the proscriptions in 5 are flexible, \"to be defined with particularity by the myriad of cases from the field of business.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., \n344 \nU.S. 392, 394\n.\n\nThis statutory scheme necessarily gives the Commission an influential role in interpreting 5 and in applying it to the facts of particular cases arising out of unprecedented situations. Moreover, as an administrative agency which deals continually with cases in the area, the Commission is often in a better position than are courts to determine when a practice is \"deceptive\" within the meaning of the Act. This Court has frequently stated that the Commission's judgment is to be given great weight by reviewing courts.\n13\n This admonition is especially true with respect to allegedly deceptive advertising since the finding of a 5 violation in this field rests so heavily on inference and pragmatic judgment. Nevertheless, while informed judicial determination is dependent upon enlightenment gained from administrative experience, in the last analysis the words \"deceptive practices\" set forth a legal standard and they must get their final meaning from judicial construction. Cf. Federal Trade Comm'n v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., Inc., \n291 \nU.S. 304, 314\n.\n\nWe are not concerned in this case with the clear misrepresentation in the commercials concerning the speed with which Rapid Shave could shave sandpaper, since the Court of Appeals upheld the Commission's finding on that matter and the respondents have not challenged the finding here. We granted certiorari to consider the Commission's conclusion that even if an advertiser has himself conducted a test, experiment or demonstration which he \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 386]\n\u00a0\n honestly believes will prove a certain product claim, he may not convey to television viewers the false impression that they are seeing the test, experiment or demonstration for themselves, when they are not because of the undisclosed use of mock-ups.\n\nWe accept the Commission's determination that the commercials involved in this case contained three representations to the public: (1) that sandpaper could be shaved by Rapid Shave; (2) that an experiment had been conducted which verified this claim; and (3) that the viewer was seeing this experiment for himself. Respondents admit that the first two representations were made, but deny that the third was. The Commission, however, found to the contrary, and, since this is a matter of fact resting on an inference that could reasonably be drawn from the commercials themselves, the Commission's finding should be sustained.\n14\n For the purposes of our review, we can assume that the first two representations were true; the focus of our consideration is on the third, which was clearly false. The parties agree that 5 prohibits the intentional misrepresentation of any fact which would constitute a material factor in a purchaser's decision whether to buy.\n15\n They differ, however, in their conception of what \"facts\" constitute a \"material factor\" in a purchaser's decision to buy. Respondents submit, in effect, that the only material facts are those which deal with the substantive qualities of a product.\n16\n The Commission, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 387]\n\u00a0\n on the other hand, submits that the misrepresentation of any fact so long as it materially induces a purchaser's decision to buy is a deception prohibited by 5.\n\nThe Commission's interpretation of what is a deceptive practice seems more in line with the decided cases than that of respondents. This Court said in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n291 \nU.S. 67, 78\n: \"[T]he public is entitled to get what it chooses, though the choice may be dictated by caprice or by fashion or perhaps by ignorance.\" It has long been considered a deceptive practice to state falsely that a product ordinarily sells for an inflated price but that it is being offered at a special reduced price, even if the offered price represents the actual value of the product and the purchaser is receiving his money's worth.\n17\n Applying respondents' arguments to these cases, it would appear that so long as buyers paid no more than the product was actually worth and the product contained the qualities advertised, the misstatement of an inflated original price was immaterial. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 388]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt has also been held a violation of 5 for a seller to misrepresent to the public that he is in a certain line of business, even though the misstatement in no way affects the qualities of the product. As was said in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Royal Milling Co., \n288 \nU.S. 212, 216\n:\n\n\"If consumers or dealers prefer to purchase a given article because it was made by a particular manufacturer or class of manufacturers, they have a right to do so, and this right cannot be satisfied by imposing upon them an exactly similar article, or one equally as good, but having a different origin.\"\n\n\n The courts of appeals have applied this reasoning to the merchandising of reprocessed products that are as good as new, without a disclosure that they are in fact reprocessed.\n18\n And it has also been held that it is a deceptive practice to misappropriate the trade name of another.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents claim that all these cases are irrelevant to our decision because they involve misrepresentations related to the product itself and not merely to the manner in which an advertising message is communicated. This distinction misses the mark for two reasons. In the first place, the present case is not concerned with a mode of communication, but with a misrepresentation that viewers have objective proof of a seller's product claim over and above the seller's word. Secondly, all of the above cases, like the present case, deal with methods designed to get a consumer to purchase a product, not with whether the product, when purchased, will perform up to expectations. We find an especially strong similarity between the present \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 389]\n\u00a0\n case and those cases in which a seller induces the public to purchase an arguably good product by misrepresenting his line of business, by concealing the fact that the product is reprocessed, or by misappropriating another's trademark. In each the seller has used a misrepresentation to break down what he regards to be an annoying or irrational habit of the buying public - the preference for particular manufacturers or known brands regardless of a product's actual qualities, the prejudice against reprocessed goods, and the desire for verification of a product claim. In each case the seller reasons that when the habit is broken the buyer will be satisfied with the performance of the product he receives. Yet, a misrepresentation has been used to break the habit and, as was stated in Algoma Lumber, a misrepresentation for such an end is not permitted.\n\nWe need not limit ourselves to the cases already mentioned because there are other situations which also illustrate the correctness of the Commission's finding in the present case. It is generally accepted that it is a deceptive practice to state falsely that a product has received a testimonial from a respected source.\n20\n In addition, the Commission has consistently acted to prevent sellers from falsely stating that their product claims have been \"certified.\"\n21\n We find these situations to be indistinguishable from the present case. We can assume that in each the underlying product claim is true and in each the seller actually conducted an experiment sufficient to prove to himself the truth of the claim. But in each the seller has told the public that it could rely on something other than his word concerning both the truth of the claim and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 390]\n\u00a0\n the validity of his experiment. We find it an immaterial difference that in one case the viewer is told to rely on the word of a celebrity or authority he respects, in another on the word of a testing agency, and in the present case on his own perception of an undisclosed simulation.\n\nRespondents again insist that the present case is not like any of the above, but is more like a case in which a celebrity or independent testing agency has in fact submitted a written verification of an experiment actually observed, but, because of the inability of the camera to transmit accurately an impression of the paper on which the testimonial is written, the seller reproduces it on another substance so that it can be seen by the viewing audience. This analogy ignores the finding of the Commission that in the present case the seller misrepresented to the public that it was being given objective proof of a product claim. In respondents' hypothetical the objective proof of the product claim that is offered, the word of the celebrity or agency that the experiment was actually conducted, does exist; while in the case before us the objective proof offered, the viewer's own perception of an actual experiment, does not exist. Thus, in respondents' hypothetical, unlike the present case, the use of the undisclosed mock-up does not conflict with the seller's claim that there is objective proof.\n\nWe agree with the Commission, therefore, that the undisclosed use of plexiglass in the present commercials was a material deceptive practice, independent and separate from the other misrepresentation found. We find unpersuasive respondents' other objections to this conclusion. Respondents claim that it will be impractical to inform the viewing public that it is not seeing an actual test, experiment or demonstration, but we think it inconceivable that the ingenious advertising world will be unable, if it so desires, to conform to the Commission's insistence that the public be not misinformed. If, however, it becomes \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 391]\n\u00a0\n impossible or impractical to show simulated demonstrations on television in a truthful manner, this indicates that television is not a medium that lends itself to this type of commercial, not that the commercial must survive at all costs. Similarly unpersuasive is respondents' objection that the Commission's decision discriminates against sellers whose product claims cannot be \"verified\" on television without the use of simulations. All methods of advertising do not equally favor every seller. If the inherent limitations of a method do not permit its use in the way a seller desires, the seller cannot by material misrepresentation compensate for those limitations.\n\nRespondents also claim that the Commission reached out to decide a question not properly before it and has presented this Court with an abstract question. They argue that since the commercials in the present case misrepresented the time element involved in shaving sandpaper, this Court should not consider the additional misrepresentation that the public had objective proof of the seller's claim. As we have already said, these misrepresentations are separate and distinct, and we fail to see why respondents should be sheltered from a cease-and-desist order with respect to one deceptive practice merely because they also engaged in another.\n\nRespondents finally object to what they consider to be the absence of an adequate record to sustain the Commission's finding. It is true that in its initial stages the case was concerned more with the misrepresentation about the product's underlying qualities than with the misrepresentation that objective proof was being given. Nevertheless, both misrepresentations were in the case from the beginning, and respondents were never prejudicially misled into believing that the second question was not being considered. Nor was it necessary for the Commission to conduct a survey of the viewing public before it could determine that the commercials had a tendency to mislead, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 392]\n\u00a0\n for when the Commission finds deception it is also authorized, within the bounds of reason, to infer that the deception will constitute a material factor in a purchaser's decision to buy. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. Raladam Co., \n316 \nU.S. 149, 152\n. We find the record in this case sufficient to support the Commission's findings.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWe turn our attention now to the order issued by the Commission. It has been repeatedly held that the Commission has wide discretion in determining the type of order that is necessary to cope with the unfair practices found, e. g., Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 611\n, and that Congress has placed the primary responsibility for fashioning orders upon the Commission, Federal Trade Comm'n v. National Lead Co., \n352 \nU.S. 419, 429\n. For these reasons the courts should not \"lightly modify\" the Commission's orders. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 726\n. However, this Court has also warned that an order's prohibitions \"should be clear and precise in order that they may be understood by those against whom they are directed,\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, supra, at 726, and that \"[t]he severity of possible penalties prescribed . . . for violations of orders which have become final underlines the necessity for fashioning orders which are, at the outset, sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Henry Broch & Co., \n368 \nU.S. 360, 367\n-368.\n\nThe Court of Appeals has criticized the reference in the Commission's order to \"test, experiment or demonstration\" as not capable of practical interpretation. It could find no difference between the Rapid Shave commercial and a commercial which extolled the goodness of ice cream while giving viewers a picture of a scoop of mashed \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 393]\n\u00a0\n potatoes appearing to be ice cream. We do not understand this difficulty. In the ice cream case the mashed potato prop is not being used for additional proof of the product claim, while the purpose of the Rapid Shave commercial is to give the viewer objective proof of the claims made. If in the ice cream hypothetical the focus of the commercial becomes the undisclosed potato prop and the viewer is invited, explicitly or by implication, to see for himself the truth of the claims about the ice cream's rich texture and full color, and perhaps compare it to a \"rival product,\" then the commercial has become similar to the one now before us. Clearly, however, a commercial which depicts happy actors delightedly eating ice cream that is in fact mashed potatoes or drinking a product appearing to be coffee but which is in fact some other substance is not covered by the present order.\n\nThe crucial terms of the present order - \"test, experiment or demonstration . . . represented . . . as actual proof of a claim\" - are as specific as the circumstances will permit. If respondents in their subsequent commercials attempt to come as close to the line of misrepresentation as the Commission's order permits, they may without specifically intending to do so cross into the area proscribed by this order. However, it does not seem \"unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.\" Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 337, 340\n. In commercials where the emphasis is on the seller's word, and not on the viewer's own perception, the respondents need not fear that an undisclosed use of props is prohibited by the present order. On the other hand, when the commercial not only makes a claim, but also invites the viewer to rely on his own perception for demonstrative proof of the claim, the respondents will be aware that the use of undisclosed props in strategic places might be a material deception. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 394]\n\u00a0\n We believe that respondents will have no difficulty applying the Commission's order to the vast majority of their contemplated future commercials. If, however, a situation arises in which respondents are sincerely unable to determine whether a proposed course of action would violate the present order, they can, by complying with the Commission's rules,\n22\n oblige the Commission to give them definitive advice as to whether their proposed action, if pursued, would constitute compliance with the order.\n\nFinally, we find no defect in the provision of the order which prohibits respondents from engaging in similar practices with respect to \"any product\" they advertise. The propriety of a broad order depends upon the specific circumstances of the case, but the courts will not interfere except where the remedy selected has no reasonable relation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 395]\n\u00a0\n to the unlawful practices found to exist.\n23\n In this case the respondents produced three different commercials which employed the same deceptive practice. This we believe gave the Commission a sufficient basis for believing that the respondents would be inclined to use similar commercials with respect to the other products they advertise. We think it reasonable for the Commission to frame its order broadly enough to prevent respondents from engaging in similarly illegal practices in future advertisements. As was said in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 473\n: \"[T]he Commission is not limited to prohibiting the illegal practice in the precise form in which it is found to have existed in the past.\" Having been caught violating the Act, respondents \"must expect some fencing in.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. National Lead Co., \n352 \nU.S. 419, 431\n.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded for the entry of a judgment enforcing the Commission's order.\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Stat. 717, as amended, 52 Stat. 111, 15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1) (1958 ed.): \"Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 52 Stat. 114, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45 (i) (1958 ed.): \"If the order of the Commission is modified or set aside by the court of appeals, and if (1) the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari has expired and no such petition has been duly filed, or (2) the petition for certiorari has been denied, or (3) the decision of the court has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, then the order of the Commission rendered in accordance with the mandate of the court of appeals shall become final on the expiration of thirty days from the time such order of the Commission was rendered, unless within such thirty days either party has instituted proceedings to have such order corrected so that it will accord with the mandate, in which event the order of the Commission shall become final when so corrected.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Securities & Exchange Comm'n v.

JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting in part.\n\nUnder the limited grant of certiorari in this case, the Court must assume that the advertiser can perform the experiment in question and that the demonstration is as simple to execute as it appears on television. The only question here is what techniques the advertiser may use to convey essential truth to the television viewer. If the claim is true and valid, then the technique for projecting that claim, within broad boundaries, falls purely within the advertiser's art. The warrant to the Federal Trade Commission is to police the verity of the claim itself. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 396]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI do not agree that the use of \"mock-ups\" by the television advertiser is of itself a deceptive trade practice. Further, while there was an independent deceptive element in this commercial, I do not think this record justifies the broad remedial order issued by the Commission. I would remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n   \"MOCK-UPS\" AS SUCH.\n\n\n The faulty prop in the Court's reasoning is that it focuses entirely on what is taking place in the studio rather than on what the viewer is seeing on his screen. That which the viewer sees with his own eyes is not, however, what is taking place in the studio, but an electronic image. If the image he sees on the screen is an accurate reproduction of what he would see with the naked eyes were the experiment performed before him with sandpaper in his home or in the studio, there can hardly be a misrepresentation in any legally significant sense. While the Commission undoubtedly possesses broad authority to give content to the proscriptions of the Act, its discretion, as the Court recognizes, is not unbridled, and \"in the last analysis the words `deceptive practices' set forth a legal standard and they must get their final meaning from judicial construction\" (ante, p. 385). In this case, assuming that Rapid Shave could soften sandpaper as quickly as it does sand-covered plexiglass, a viewer who wants to entertain his friends by duplicating the actual experiment could do so by buying a can of Rapid Shave and some sandpaper. If he wished to shave himself, and his beard were really as tough as sandpaper, he could perform this part of his morning ablutions with Rapid Shave in the same way as he saw the plexiglass shaved on television. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI do not see how such a commercial can be said to be \"deceptive\" in any legally acceptable use of that term. The Court attempts to distinguish the case where a \"celebrity\" has written a testimonial endorsing some product, but the original testimonial cannot be seen over television and a copy is shown over the air by the manufacturer. The Court states of this \"hypothetical\": \"In respondents' hypothetical the objective proof of the product claim that is offered, the word of the celebrity or agency that the experiment was actually conducted, does exist: while in the case before us the objective proof offered, the viewer's own perception of an actual experiment, does not exist.\" Ante, at 390. But in both cases the viewer is told to \"see for himself,\" in the one case that the celebrity has endorsed the product; in the other, that the product can shave sandpaper; in neither case is the viewer actually seeing the proof; and in both cases the objective proof does exist, be it the original testimonial or the sandpaper test actually conducted by the manufacturer. In neither case, however, is there a material misrepresentation, because what the viewer sees is an accurate image of the objective proof.\n\nNor can I readily understand how the accurate portrayal of an experiment by means of a mock-up can be considered more deceptive than the use of mashed potatoes to convey the glamorous qualities of a particular ice cream (ante, pp. 392-393); indeed, to a potato-lover \"the smile on the face of the tiger\" might come more naturally than if he were actually being served ice cream.\n\nIt is commonly known that television presents certain distortions in transmission for which the broadcasting industry must compensate. Thus, a white towel will look a dingy gray over television, but a blue towel will look a sparkling white. On the Court's analysis, an advertiser must achieve accuracy in the studio even though it results \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 398]\n\u00a0\n in an inaccurate image being projected on the home screen. This led the Court of Appeals to question whether it would be proper for an advertiser to show a product on television that somehow, because of the medium, looks better on the screen than it does in real life. 310 F.2d 89, 94; 326 F.2d 517, 523, n. 16.\n\nA perhaps more commonplace example suggests itself: Would it be proper for respondent Colgate, in advertising a laundry detergent, to \"demonstrate\" the effectiveness of a major competitor's detergent in washing white sheets; and then \"before the viewer's eyes,\" to wash a white (not a blue) sheet with the competitor's detergent? The studio test would accurately show the quality of the product, but the image on the screen would look as though the sheet had been washed with an ineffective detergent. All that has happened here is the converse: a demonstration has been altered in the studio to compensate for the distortions of the television medium, but in this instance in order to present an accurate picture to the television viewer.\n\nIn short, it seems to me that the proper legal test in cases of this kind concerns not what goes on in the broadcasting studio, but whether what is shown on the television screen is an accurate representation of the advertised product and of the claims made for it.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n   THE COMMISSION'S REMEDY.\n\n\n The Commission ordered both respondents to cease and desist from using mock-ups in any \"test, experiment or demonstration\" - in the case of respondent Bates. whether or not relating to Colgate products - as a result of its finding that the use of a plexiglass mock-up in this instance constituted a separate misrepresentation. If that were the only misrepresentation found by the Commission, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 399]\n\u00a0\n I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The Commission, however, found another misrepresentation, not disputed here, namely, that Rapid Shave would shave sandpaper as quickly as plexiglass, and on this record I cannot say that such finding might not support the Commission's broad order.\n\nIn so concluding, some further observations are called for. The Court brings to the support of the Commission's broad order the suggestion that it might be difficult for the Commission to police the reliability of simulated demonstrations, and, further, that the Commission might have cause for concern as to advertisers which have demonstrated a propensity for misrepresentation. The policing factor certainly should not permit the Commission to sweep with the broad brush it has used here, since the same risk of inaccurate reproduction inheres in all commercials, not only those involving tests or experiments. Although the Commission doubtless has wide discretion in fashioning remedies (ante, p. 395), I do not believe that an order banning use of all mock-ups can be justified merely on the score of \"policing.\"\n\nThere is some indication, however, that the Commission has had troubles with both respondents in the past (see 59 F. T. C. 1452, 1473 and n. 30). If the Commission should find that a pattern of misrepresentations by respondents creates a substantial risk that they will not accurately portray experiments if permitted to continue using mock-ups, the Commission's present order might well be justified. I think the Commission should have an opportunity to make such findings, which were unnecessary under what I believe was its mistaken view of the case.\n\nTo that end, I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings in light of what has been said in this opinion. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 374, 400]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFTC v. CONSOLIDATED FOODS(1965)\nNo. 422\nArgued: Decided: April 28, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent, a large, diversified company, which owns food processing plants and a network of wholesale and retail food stores, in 1951 acquired Gentry, Inc., a manufacturer of dehydrated onion and garlic. Gentry, before the merger, had about 32% of the sales of those products, and, with its chief competitor, accounted for about 90% of the total industry sales. By 1958, in an expanding market, Gentry had 35% of the sales and the combined share with its principal competitor remained about 90%. After the merger respondent attempted to induce reciprocal buying of Gentry's products by respondent's suppliers. The Federal Trade Commission held that the acquisition violated 7 of the Clayton Act, as the opportunity for reciprocal buying in this oligopolistic industry created a probability of a substantial lessening of competition and ordered divestiture. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding no substantial impact on the market in the light of ten years of post-acquisition experience. Held:\n\n 1. Post-acquisition evidence of the effect of the merger upon competition is entitled to consideration in determining whether a merger violates 7, but it must not be given conclusive weight or allowed to override all probabilities. P. 598.\n\n\n 2. The finding by the Commission of the probability of reciprocal buying leading to a lessening of competition in the instant case was supported by substantial evidence.

Consolidated Foods Corp. - which owns food processing plants and a network of wholesale and retail food stores - acquired Gentry, Inc., in 1951. Gentry manufactures principally dehydrated onion and garlic. The Federal Trade Commission held that the acquisition violated 7 because it gave respondent the advantage of a mixed threat and lure of reciprocal buying in its competition for business and \"the power to foreclose competition from a substantial share of the markets for dehydrated onion and garlic.\" It concluded, in other words, that the effect of the acquisition \"may be substantially to lessen competition\" within the meaning of 7, and it ordered divestiture and gave \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 594]\n\u00a0\n other relief. ___ F. T. C. ___, ___. The Court of Appeals, relying mainly on 10 years of post-acquisition experience, held that the Commission had failed to show a probability that the acquisition would substantially lessen competition. 329 F.2d 623. The case is here on certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 912\n.\n\nWe hold at the outset that the \"reciprocity\" made possible by such an acquisition is one of the congeries of anticompetitive practices at which the antitrust laws are aimed. The practice results in \"an irrelevant and alien factor,\" ___ F. T. C., p. ___, intruding into the choice among competing products, creating at the least \"a priority on the business at equal prices.\" International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 396\n-397; Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 6, 12. Reciprocal trading may ensue not from bludgeoning or coercion but from more subtle arrangements. A threatened withdrawal of orders if products of an affiliate cease being bought, as well as a conditioning of future purchases on the receipt of orders for products of that affiliate, is an anticompetitive practice.\n2\n Section 7 of the Clayton Act is \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n concerned \"with probabilities, not certainties.\" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, \n370 \nU.S. 294, 323\n; United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, \n374 \nU.S. 321, 362\n. Reciprocity in trading as a result of an acquisition violates 7, if the probability of a lessening of competition is shown. We turn then to that, the principal, aspect of the present case.\n\nConsolidated is a substantial purchaser of the products of food processors who in turn purchase dehydrated onion and garlic for use in preparing and packaging their food. Gentry, which as noted is principally engaged in the manufacture of dehydrated onion and garlic, had in 1950, immediately prior to its acquisition by Consolidated, about 32% of the total sales of the dehydrated garlic and onion industry and, together with its principal competitor, Basic Vegetable Products, Inc., accounted for almost 90% of the total industry sales. The remaining 10% was divided between two other firms. By 1958 the total industry output of both products had doubled, Gentry's share rising to 35% and the combined share of Gentry and Basic remaining at about 90%.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 596]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the acquisition Consolidated (though later disclaiming adherence to any policy of reciprocity) did undertake to assist Gentry in selling. An official of Consolidated wrote as follows to its distributing divisions:\n\n \"Oftentimes, it is a great advantage to know when you are calling on a prospect, whether or not that prospect is a supplier of someone within your own organization. Everyone believes in reciprocity providing all things are equal.\n\n\n \"Attached is a list of prospects for our Gentry products. We would like to have you indicate on the list whether or not you are purchasing any of your supplies from them. If so, indicate whether your purchases are relatively large, small or insignificant. . . .\n\n\n .  . .  .  .\n\n\n \"Will you please refer the list to the proper party in your organization. . . . If you have any special suggestions, as to how you could be helpful in properly presenting Gentry to any of those listed, it will be appreciated.\"\n\n\n Food processors who sold to Consolidated stated they would give their onion and garlic business to Gentry for reciprocity reasons if it could meet the price and quality of its competitors' products. Typical is a letter from Armour and Co.:\n\n \"I can assure you that it is the desire of our people to reciprocate and cooperate with you in any way we can in line with good business practices, and I am sure that if our quality obstacles can be overcome, your quotations will receive favorable consideration. We value our relationship with you very highly and are disappointed that we have been unable lately to reciprocate for your fine cooperation on Armour Pantry Shelf Meats.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 597]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Some suppliers responded and gave reciprocal orders. Some who first gave generous orders later reduced them or abandoned the practice. It is impossible to recreate the precise anatomy of the market arrangements following the acquisition, though respondent offers a factual brief seeking to prove that \"reciprocity\" either failed or was not a major factor in the post-acquisition history.\n\nThe Commission found, however, that \"merely as a result of its connection with Consolidated, and without any action on the latter's part, Gentry would have an unfair advantage over competitors enabling it to make sales that otherwise might not have been made.\"\n\nAnd the Commission concluded:\n\n\"With two firms accounting for better than 85% of both product lines for eleven successive years, maximum concentration short of monopoly has already been achieved. If it is desirable to prevent a trend toward oligopoly it is a fortiori desirable to remove, so far as possible, obstacles to the creation of genuinely competitive conditions in an oligopolistic industry. Respondent's reciprocal buying power, obtained through acquisition of Gentry, is just such an anticompetitive obstacle.\n\n\n \"This conclusion is buttressed by the peculiar nature of the dehydrated onion and garlic industry. In the first place, the record shows that Gentry's leading competitor, Basic Vegetable Products, Inc., has been the innovator and leader in the field. Gentry has recently made technical strides narrowing, although probably not closing, the gap between them. There is also evidence that the third firm, Puccinelli Packing Co., is not only much smaller - commanding only about 10% of each product market - but is considered by many buyers to offer an inferior product and inferior service.\" ___ F. T. C., p. ___. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 598]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, gave post-acquisition evidence almost conclusive weight. It pointed out that, while Gentry's share of the dehydrated onion market increased by some 7%, its share of the dehydrated garlic market decreased 12%. 329 F.2d, p. 626. It also relied on apparently unsuccessful attempts at reciprocal buying. Ibid. The Court of Appeals concluded that \"Probability can best be gauged by what the past has taught\" Id., p. 627.\n\nThe Court of Appeals was not in error in considering the post-acquisition evidence in this case. See United States v. du Pont & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 597\n et seq., 602 et seq. But we think it gave too much weight to it. Cf. United States v. Continental Can Co., \n378 \nU.S. 441, 463\n. No group acquiring a company with reciprocal buying opportunities is entitled to a \"free trial\" period. To give it such would be to distort the scheme of 7. The \"mere possibility\" of the prohibited restraint is not enough. (United States v. du Pont & Co., supra, p. 598.) Probability of the proscribed evil is required, as we have noted. If the post-acquisition evidence were given conclusive weight or allowed to override all probabilities, then acquisitions would go forward willy-nilly, the parties biding their time until reciprocity was allowed fully to bloom. It is, of course, true that post-acquisition conduct may amount to a violation of 7 even though there is no evidence to establish probability in limine. See United States v. du Pont & Co., supra, pp. 597-598. But the force of 7 is still in probabilities, not in what later transpired. That must necessarily be the case, for once the two companies are united no one knows what the fate of the acquired company and its competitors would have been but for the merger.\n\nMoreover, the post-acquisition evidence here tends to confirm, rather than cast doubt upon, the probable anti-competitive effect which the Commission found the merger would have. The Commission found that Basic's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 599]\n\u00a0\n product was superior to Gentry's - as Gentry's president freely and repeatedly admitted. Yet Gentry, in a rapidly expanding market, was able to increase its share of onion sales by 7% and to hold its losses in garlic to a 12% decrease. Thus the Commission was surely on safe ground in reaching the following conclusion:\n\n \"If reciprocal buying creates for Gentry a protected  market, which others cannot penetrate despite superiority  of price, quality, or service, competition is  lessened whether or not Gentry can expand its market  share. It is for this reason that we reject respondent's  argument that the decline in its share of  the garlic market proves the ineffectiveness of reciprocity.  We do not know that its share would not  have fallen still farther, had it not been for the influence  of reciprocal buying. This loss of sales fails to  refute the likelihood that Consolidated's reciprocity  power, which it has shown a willingness to exploit to  the full, will not immunize a substantial segment of  the garlic market from normal quality, price, and  service competition.\" ___ F. T. C., p. ___.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n But the Court of Appeals ignored the Commission's findings as to the inferiority of Gentry's product; indeed at one point it even supplanted those findings with its own conclusion that Gentry's onions were superior:\n\n \"Consolidated's Gentry division in the years following the acquisition, during which time it improved its onion processing equipment to eliminate a problem arising from the presence of wood splinters and achieved a product of higher quality than that of its competitors, increased its share of the rapidly expanding market by only some 7% with respect to dehydrated onion . . . .\" 329 F.2d, p. 626. (Emphasis supplied.) \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 600]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n But the Commission's contrary conclusion was unquestionably based on substantial evidence, as the following excerpt from the testimony of Gentry's president particularly indicates:\n\n \"Q. You mentioned the fact. Dr. Prater, that Gentry had a reputation of being second to Basic in quality. Was one of the factors involved in the quality competition the wood splinter problem?\n\n\n \"A. Yes, the wood splinter problem has been a problem in the dehydration industry for many years. Basic exploited this extensively, and solved it by improvements in production techniques in the use, or by the use of better methods. and by using, instead of wood trays, trays of aluminum plastic glass fibers. We met this competition partially by the improvement of our production techniques and installation of continuous conveyor dehydrators.\"\n\n\n We do not go so far as to say that any acquisition, no matter how small, violates 7 if there is a probability of reciprocal buying. Some situations may amount only to de minimis. But where, as here, the acquisition is of a company that commands a substantial share of a market, a finding of probability of reciprocal buying by the Commission, whose expertise the Congress trusts, should be honored, if there is substantial evidence to support it.\n\nThe evidence is in our view plainly substantial. Reciprocity was tried over and again and it sometimes worked. The industry structure was peculiar, Basic being the leader with Gentry closing the gap. Moreover there is evidence, as the Commission found, \"that many buyers have determined that their source of supply may best be protected by a policy of buying from two suppliers.\" When reciprocal buying - or the inducement of it - is added, the Commission observed:\n\n\"Buyers are likely to lean toward Basic on the ground of quality, but, in seeking a second, protective supply \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 601]\n\u00a0\n channel, to purchase from Gentry in the belief that this will further their sales to Consolidated. Not only does Gentry thus obtain sales that might otherwise go to Basic or Puccinelli, but the two-firm oligopoly structure of the industry is strengthened and solidified and new entry by others is discouraged.\" ___ F. T. C., p. ___.\n\n\n We conclude that there is substantial evidence to sustain that conclusion and that the order of the Commission should not have been denied enforcement. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 7 reads in pertinent part as follows: \"No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\" 15 U.S.C. 18.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Edwards, Conglomerate Bigness as a Source of Power, in Nat.

A reciprocal buying arrangement may arise either through formal contract or through an informal understanding that may be scarcely distinguishable from a mere policy of cultivating the good will of a large customer. The essence of the arrangement is the willingness of each company to buy from the other, conditioned upon the expectation that the other company will make reciprocal purchases. The goods bought are typically dissimilar in kind, and in the usual case could be obtained from other sources on terms which, aside from the reciprocal purchases, would be no less advantageous. Where such a relationship is well established, it prevents the competitors of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n each company from selling to the other company, and affords to each company whatever increase of size and strength can be derived from an assured place as supplier to the other.\" And see Stocking and Mueller, Business Reciprocity and the Size of Firms, 30 J.

By 1958, these figures were 57% and 35%, respectively. In dehydrated garlic sales, Basic had 36% of the market in 1950 and 50% in 1958, while Gentry's shares were 51% and 39% for the same years.\" 329 F.2d, p. 625.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The last three sentences were a footnote to the first sentence.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the judgment.\n\nHad the Commission's complaint been grounded on 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, it seems manifest to me that no case would have been made out on this record. But given the ambulatory use of 7 of the Clayton Act sanctioned by the Court in United States v. du Pont & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586\n, I concur in the judgment.\n\nI do so, however, upon the premises stated in the concurring opinion of my Brother STEWART, post, p. 602, but with one reservation. To the extent that anything in his opinion might be taken as drawing on evidence upon which the Commission indicated no reliance, I could not subscribe to that approach. This Court must review administrative findings as they are made by the agency concerned, and if the evidence will not support the findings and theory upon which the agency acted, an affirmance of the agency's order cannot properly rest upon a reassessment of the record by us. See Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 196\n: Labor Board v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., ante, pp. 438, 443-444. However, since both sides agree that \"conglomerate\" mergers and reciprocal buying are within the purview of 7, I think the Commission's order is supportable, though \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 602]\n\u00a0\n barely so, within the confines of the evidence upon which it apparently relied.\n\nBrown Shoe Co. v. United States, \n370 \nU.S. 294\n, forecloses any contention that the \"market affected\" was not substantial enough to bring 7 into play. In this Court Consolidated has pitched its case on the proposition that it used to the full whatever power it acquired as a result of the merger to bring about reciprocal buying. The Commission found only seven instances of successful efforts by Consolidated to pressure suppliers to buy from Gentry. If in fact these few instances had represented the full measure of Consolidated's ability to induce purchasing from Gentry, they would for me be insufficient to carry the day for the Commission's order, and I would vote to affirm. While I cannot subscribe to the undiscriminating use made in the Court's opinion of the buying statistics, I think there was enough in these seven instances - for example, the Phillips Packing Company, J. J. Gielow & Sons, Illinois Meat Company, and Morgan Packing Company episodes - for the Commission justifiably to find that Consolidated had not used all the reciprocal buying leverage it could muster; the Commission, therefore, could reasonably conclude that the probable effect of the Gentry acquisition would be substantially to lessen competition in the relevant market.\n\nOn this basis I concur in the result reached by the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the judgment.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, in invalidating a merger between Consolidated Foods and Gentry, Inc., has espoused a novel theory to bring the facts of this case within the scope of 7 of the Clayton Act. Its resolution of the issue has been much debated and much disputed.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 603]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals has disagreed with the Commission's appraisal of the facts in this case and with its conclusions concerning the 7 implications of reciprocity. Other cases are being held awaiting clarification from this Court.\n2\n We must decide the applicability of the Act to the facts of this case, but we should also provide guidance to the Commission and to the courts which will have to grapple in the future with the potentialities of reciprocal buying in 7 cases. While I agree with the result that the Court has reached, I am persuaded to file this separate statement of my views regarding the issues involved.\n\nClearly the opportunity for reciprocity is not alone enough to invalidate a merger under 7. The Clayton Act was not passed to outlaw diversification. Yet large scale diversity of industrial interests almost always presents the possibility of some reciprocal relationships. Often the purpose of diversification is to acquire companies whose present management can benefit from the technical skills and sales acumen of the acquiring corporation. Without more, 7 of the Clayton Act does not prohibit mergers whose sole effect is to introduce into an arena of \"soft\" competition the experience and skills of a more aggressive organization.\n\nIt obviously requires more than this kind of bare potential for reciprocal buying to bring a merger within the ban of 7. Before a merger may be properly outlawed under 7 on the basis solely of reciprocal buying potentials, the law requires a more closely textured economic analysis. The Court summarizes the \"substantial\" evidence before the Commission as follows:\n\n\"Reciprocity was tried over and again and it sometimes worked. The industry structure was peculiar, Basic being the leader with Gentry closing the gap. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 604]\n\u00a0\n Moreover there is evidence, as the Commission found, `that many buyers have determined that their source of supply may best be protected by a policy of buying from two suppliers.' when reciprocal buying - or the inducement of it - is added, the Commission observed: `. . . the two-firm oligopoly structure of the industry is strengthened and solidified and new entry by others is discouraged.'\"\n\n\n I cannot agree that these elements, singly or together, are sufficient to make unlawful the merger negotiated by Consolidated and Gentry. Certainly the mere effort at reciprocity cannot be the basis for finding the probability of a significant alteration in the market structure. Section 7 does not punish intent. No matter how bent on reciprocity Consolidated might have been, if its activities would not have the requisite probable impact on competition, it cannot be held to have violated this law. And, I think, it is not enough to say that the merger is illegal merely because the reciprocity attempts \"sometimes worked.\" If the opportunity for reciprocity itself is not a violation of the Act when the merger occurs, then some standard must be established for determining how effective reciprocity must be before the merger is subject to invalidation. Nor do I think that illegality of this merger can be rested upon the fact that \"[t]he industry structure was peculiar, Basic being the leader with Gentry closing the gap.\" There is evidence that in the years following 1951, when the merger took place, increased emphasis was placed on solving technical problems which had prevented some processors from relying on dehydrated, rather than raw, onions. The 1950's were a time of flux for the industry. Basic was sometimes the innovator of technological change leading to increased sales; sometimes Gentry had the upper hand. It is possible that this shift to more intensive competition was connected with the merger. Faced with a new competitive situation, Basic may have \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 605]\n\u00a0\n determined to solve quality control problems which had long been dormant. Indeed, the evidence seems to show that, after the acquisition, the industry reflected the salutary qualities normally associated with free competition. Overall, both Basic and Gentry were furnishing a better product at the end of this period than at the beginning. It is true that the industry had oligopolistic features, but there is no evidence to indicate that barriers to entry were particularly severe.\n3\n And Gentry, while it was \"closing the gap\" with regard to dehydrated onions, was falling even farther behind Basic in the sales of dehydrated garlic. Finally, I can attach no significance to the fact that processors, seeking a second source of supply, normally relied on Gentry rather than Puccinelli. That fact can rest on so many alternative hypotheses that it is persuasive as to none.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe touchstone of 7 is the probability that competition will be lessened. But before a court takes the drastic step of ordering divestiture, the evidence must be clear that such a probability exists. The Act does not require that there be a certainty of anticompetitive effect. But that does not mean that the courts or the Commission can rely on slipshod information confusingly presented and ambiguous in its implications. The law does not require proof that competition certainly will be lessened by the merger. But the record should be clear and convincing that the requisite probability is present.\n\nTo determine that probability, the courts and the Commission should rely on the best information available, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 606]\n\u00a0\n whether it is an examination of the market structure before the merger has taken place, or facts concerning the changes in the market after the merger has been consummated. For that reason, I differ with the Court in its assessment of the weight to be accorded post-acquisition evidence. That evidence is the best evidence available to determine whether the merger will district market forces in the dehydrated onion and garlic industry. The Court of Appeals, in my view, was not wrong because it \"gave too much weight\" to the post-acquisition evidence. It erred because of the gloss it placed on the statistics and testimony adduced before the hearing examiner and the Commission.\n\nThe Court discounts the value of post-acquisition evidence on the ground that the companies are not entitled to a \"free trial\" period after the merger. That characterization, however, misstates the case. No one gives the company a \"free trial\" by assessing, in light of what actually happened, what could only be hypotheses at the time the merger occurred. Without post-acquisition evidence, the trier is faced with a blank slate and untested speculation. The merger in this case was achieved in 1951, yet the Commission did not issue a cease-and-desist order until six years later. We may be sure that the Commission relied on post-acquisition factors in issuing its order; there is no reason why we should rely on those factors less in assessing the propriety of the Commission's action. Indeed, if anyone had a \"free trial\" period to check the anticompetitive potential of the merger, it was not the respondent but the Commission.\n\nThe record in this case is sorely incomplete, and a reviewing court is given little guidance in determining why this merger should be voided, if reciprocity-creating mergers are not per se invalid. Yet our responsibility to the Commission - to respect its findings where there is evidence to support them - requires close scrutiny of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 607]\n\u00a0\n record before its conclusions are upset. I think the record contains just enough to support invalidation of the merger, but because of evidence not referred to in the Court's opinion.\n\nThe food processing industry is composed basically of two classes of manufacturers. One class, which includes such processors as Armour and Swift, has built significant brand names commanding consumer acceptance of their products. For such companies, exposure at the retail market is assured. Consolidated Foods, as the wholesaler, is sufficiently dependent on such processors that its economic power over this class is minimal. It cannot readily strong-arm Armour into purchasing dehydrated onions from Gentry at the pain of losing Consolidated's favor. A second class incorporates the smaller processors in the industry. Many of these sell their product to Consolidated in bulk, for packaging under house labels of Consolidated divisions. Many of the products which these processors package under their own labels are not so widely known; they rely on the wholesaler to persuade supermarkets to try them on their counters. These processors are susceptible to the subtle pressures of reciprocity.\n\nMy reading of the record persuades me that most of the processors in this second class shifted their buying from Basic to Gentry, though the extent of that shift varied from company to company. It is true that testimony from the purchasing agents of many of these companies attributed the shift to other causes. However, the pattern of movement in this class, when contrasted to the lack of a pattern among the major processors, seems to me sufficient to support the Commission's conclusion that these shifts were in response to the influence of reciprocity, whether express or \"tacitly accommodative.\" The pattern is relevant because the independent processors are substantial purchasers in the dehydrated onion and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 592, 608]\n\u00a0\n garlic market. Furthermore, this pattern confirms what was assumed by the Commission: that Consolidated has the power to influence the purchases by a substantial segment of its suppliers. Some of the independent processors have failed, and others have merged with large processors leading to greater concentration in the food processing industry. The Commission could, therefore, have fairly concluded that the inhibitory effects of reciprocity in this situation marked this merger with illegality.\n\nFor these reasons I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Hausman, Reciprocal Dealing and the Antitrust Laws, 77 Harv.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered the paint company to cease and desist from the practice as being deceptive under 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act since the paint company had no history of selling single cans of paint; it had been marketing two cans; and had misrepresented by allocating to one can what was in fact the price of two cans.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent Mary Carter Paint Company\n1\n manufactures and sells paint and related products. The Federal Trade Commission ordered respondent to cease and desist from the use of certain representations found by the Commission to be deceptive and in violation of 5 of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 52 Stat. 111, 15 U.S.C. 45 (1964 ed.). 60 F. T. C. 1830, 1845. The representations appeared in advertisements which stated in various ways that for every can of respondent's paint purchased by a buyer, the respondent would give the buyer a \"free\" can of equal quality and quantity. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit set aside the Commission's order. 333 F.2d 654. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 957\n. We reverse.\n\nAlthough there is some ambiguity in the Commission's opinion, we cannot say that its holding constituted a departure from Commission policy regarding the use of the commercially exploitable word \"free.\" Initial efforts to define the term in decisions\n2\n were followed by \"Guides Against Deceptive Pricing.\"\n3\n These informed businessmen that they might advertise an article as \"free,\" even though purchase of another article was required, so long as the terms of the offer were clearly stated, the price of the article required to be purchased was not increased, and its quality and quantity were not diminished. With specific reference to two-for-the-price-of-one offers, the Guides required that either the sales price for the two be \"the advertiser's usual and customary retail price for the single article in the recent, regular course of his business,\" or where the advertiser has not previously sold the article, the price for two be the \"usual and customary\" price for one in the relevant trade areas. These, of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n course, were guides, not fixed rules as such, and were designed to inform businessmen of the factors which would guide Commission decision. Although Mary Carter seems to have attempted to tailor its offer to come within their terms, the Commission found that it failed; the offer complied in appearance only.\n\nThe gist of the Commission's reasoning is in the hearing examiner's finding, which it adopted, that\n\n\"the usual and customary retail price of each can of Mary Carter paint was not, and is not now, the price designated in the advertisement [$6.98] but was, and is now, substantially less than such price. The second can of paint was not, and is not now, `free,' that is, was not, and is not now, given as a gift or gratuity. The offer is, on the contrary, an offer of two cans of paint for the price advertised as or purporting to be the list price or customary and usual price of one can.\" 60 F. T. C., at 1844.\n\n\n In sum, the Commission found that Mary Carter had no history of selling single cans of paint; it was marketing twins, and in allocating what is in fact the price of two cans to one can, yet calling one \"free,\" Mary Carter misrepresented. It is true that respondent was not permitted to show that the quality of its paint matched those paints which usually and customarily sell in the $6.98 range, or that purchasers of paint estimate quality by the price they are charged. If both claims were established, it is arguable that any deception was limited to a representation that Mary Carter has a usual and customary price for single cans of paint, when it has no such price. However, it is not for courts to say whether this violates the Act. \"[T]he Commission is often in a better position than are courts to determine when a practice is `deceptive' within the meaning of the Act.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., \n380 \nU.S. 374\n, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n 385. There was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission's finding; its determination that the practice here was deceptive was neither arbitrary nor clearly wrong. The Court of Appeals should have sustained it. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., supra; Carter Products, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 323 F.2d 523, 528.\n\nThe Commission advises us in its brief that it believes it would be appropriate here \"to remand the case to it for clarification of its order.\" The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case is remanded to that court with directions to remand to the Commission for clarification of its order.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hereinafter Mary Carter or respondent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 48 F.

JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nIn my opinion the basis for the Commission's action is too opaque to justify an upholding of its order in this case. A summary discussion of the facts and Commission proceedings will suffice to show why I cannot subscribe to the majority's disposition.\n\nSince 1951 the enterprise now known as Mary Carter Paint Company has been manufacturing paint products for direct distribution through its own outlets and franchised dealers. For most or all of this period, its practice has been to establish its prices on a per-can basis but to give each customer a second can without further charge for each can purchased. Mary Carter's advertisements, while disclosing that the first can of each pair must be bought at the listed price, have always described the second can as \"free\"; typical slogans are: \"Buy one get one free\" and \"Every second can free.\" It is this advertising which the Commission now condemns as unfair and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n deceptive under 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 52 Stat. 111, 15 U.S.C. 45 (1964 ed.).\n\nTo the extent that the Commission's order may rest on the proposition that the second can is not \"free\" because its receipt is \"tied\" to the purchase of the first can, it is manifestly inconsistent with the rules governing use of the word \"free\" maintained by the Commission for over a decade. No one suggests that the additional can of Mary Carter paint is free in the sense that no conditions are attached to its receipt, but the FTC forsook this commercially unrealistic definition in 1953. In that year, first by its decision in Walter J. Black, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 225, and then a general policy statement, 4 CCH Trade Reg. Rep. \u00a7 40,210, it sanctioned use of the word \"free\" to describe an item given without extra charge on condition of another purchase so long as the condition was plainly stated and the \"tying\" product was not increased in price for the occasion or decreased in quantity or quality. The FTC prefaced these rules in Black by saying that \"[t]he businessmen of the United States are entitled to a clear and unequivocal answer\" and it represented that its new position would be maintained until either Congress or the courts decided otherwise. 50 F. T. C., at 232, 235.\n\nThere is presently no charge by the Commission that Mary Carter failed to comply with this general statement which continued in force through the proceedings and decision affecting Mary Carter. Rather, for the greater period of its advertising operations Mary Carter could properly claim to have relied on the FTC's official pronouncement while it was establishing its \"every second can free\" slogan in the public mind, an investment now seemingly lost. Without inflexibly holding the Commission to its promise and avowed position, certainly solid justification should be demanded before the courts agree \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n that this departure is not \"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\" Administrative Procedure Act 10 (e), 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009 (e) (1964 ed.).\n\nAt the very least the Commission should be required to demonstrate real deception and public injury in a decision that allows the courts to evaluate its reasoning and businessmen to comply with assurance with its latest views; these standards are not met by the FTC's opinion in this case. The Department of Justice suggests that the FTC regards the advertisements as implying that Mary Carter regularly sells its paint for the present per-can price without giving an extra can free;\n1\n from this premise, it might be argued, the buyer may then conclude that each can of Mary Carter is the equal of similarly priced rivals with whom it has regularly competed on equal terms in the past, making the present \"free\" can offer appear an excellent bargain. But the advertising in the present case does not really suggest that the \"free\" can is a departure from Mary Carter's usual pricing policy. Certainly nothing in any of the publicity states that the extra can is a \"new\" bargain or asserts that the opportunity may lapse in the near future. To the contrary, a number of Mary Carter advertisements, not separately treated by the Commission, affirmatively suggest that the extra-can offer has been and will continue to be \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 52]\n\u00a0\n the sales policy. Far from trying to imply that its extra-can offer represents a temporary saving for the customer, Mary Carter has striven over a number of years to associate itself irrevocably in the public mind with the notion that every second can is free; the catchphrase appears in one form or another in nearly all the ads before us and is even imprinted on the top of Mary Carter paint cans. Finally, it is not without irony that the Commission, presumably seeking to protect the consumer from any unfounded ultimate conclusions that a can of Mary Carter is as good as its high-priced rivals, rejected an offer of proof from the company that a single can of Mary Carter is scientifically equal or superior to the leading paints that sell at the same per-can price level without giving bonus cans. Actually, there is no suggestion that any volume of consumer complaints has been received, which further deepens the mystery why this frail proceeding was ever initiated.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe temptation to gloss over the analytical failings of the rationale now asserted for the FTC by relying on agency expertise must be short-lived in this case. Any findings by the FTC as to what the public may conclude from particular phrasings are most inexplicit, no distinction is taken between the various ads in question, and the conduct prescribed is never sharply identified. Surely there can be no resort to uninvoked expertise to buttress an unarticulated theory.\n\nThe opaqueness of the Commission's opinion and order makes their approval difficult for yet other reasons. The \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n bite of the FTC decision is in its order, which even the Commission recognizes to be unclear; how the Commission order can be upheld before this Court is told what exactly it means is indeed a puzzling question. Additionally, by failing to spell out its rationale the FTC decision breeds the suspicion that it is not merely ad hoc\n3\n but quite possibly irreconcilable with the Black case seemingly reaffirmed by the Commission in this very proceeding. If the Commission is able to write an opinion and order that can cure these defects and draw the plain distinctions necessary to assure fair warning and equal treatment for other advertisers, it has not done so yet.\n\nIn administering 5 in the context of the many elusive questions raised by modern advertising, it is the duty of the Commission to speak and rule clearly so that lawabiding businessmen may know where they stand. In proscribing a practice uncomplained of by the public. effectively harmless to the consumer, allowed by the Commission's long-established policy statement, and only a hairbreadth away from advertising practices that the Commission will continue to permit, I think that the Commission in this instance has fallen far short of what is necessary to entitle its order to enforcement.\n\nFor these reasons I would not disturb the judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the Commission's order.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Such an implication might be thought to run counter to the spirit of the now-superseded Guide V, Guides Against Deceptive Pricing, 23 Fed. Reg. 7965 (1958), requiring that the sales price for two articles in a two-for-the-price-of-one sale must be the usual and customary price for one. Mary Carter can, of course, reasonably claim to have complied with the letter of Guide V; assuming that it is making a two-for-the-price-of-one offer in substance, the advertised sum is the usual and customary price which a purchaser has to pay in order to acquire a single can. There is evidence that on at least a few occasions customers took only one can, paying the advertised per-can price. There is no evidence that Mary Carter permitted or tolerated sales of single cans at less than the advertised per-can price.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] I put aside the argument that might arise from Mary Carter's practice of selling its paint in both gallon and quart cans. Conceivably, one might order a gallon and receive an unneeded extra gallon, never realizing that two quarts purchased plus two quarts free could be had for a smaller sum. The FTC ignored and the Government expressly disclaims reliance on any such argument. Moreover, many ads seem to give both quart and gallon prices.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Of the post-1952 cases cited in the majority's note 2 (ante, p. 47), none is authority for condemning Mary Carter's advertising. Puro Co., 50 F. T. C. 454 (1953), and Ray S. Kalwajtys, 52 F. T. C. 721, enforced, 237 F.2d 654 (1956), both involved plain deceptions as to the usual prices of the items in question. Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 778 (1954), and the Black case both exculpate sellers under the rule finally appearing in the 1953 policy statement, with whose terms Mary Carter has complied. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 46, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFTC v.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(1965)\nNo. 352\nArgued: March 10, 1965Decided: April 27, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947 imposes a franchise tax on corporations engaging in trade or business within the District, which is measured by that portion of the net income which \"is fairly attributable to any trade or business carried on or engaged in within the District.\" The Act provides that if the corporation's trade or business is carried on both within and without the District, the net income derived therefrom shall be deemed to be income from sources within and without the District. Pursuant to statutory authority the District Commissioners issued regulations providing that where income is derived from the manufacture and sale of tangible personalty, the portion to be apportioned to the District shall be such percentage of the total income as the District sales are of total sales made everywhere. The petitioner, a Delaware corporation manufacturing and selling motor vehicles and parts, has manufacturing plants in Michigan, Delaware and Maryland, from which orders for car sales to dealers in the District were filled. The petitioner attacks the assessment of taxes pursuant to the regulations as unauthorized by the statute and violative of the Constitution. The Court of Appeals sustained the assessment formula. Held: The challenged regulations exceed the statutory authority by allocating income to the District in disregard of the express restrictions of the law. Pp. 555-562.\n\n (a) With respect to that portion of petitioner's income which arises from sales within the District and manufacture outside the District, the statute requires that some part thereof be deemed to arise from sources outside the District. Pp. 557-559.\n\n\n (b) Since most States imposing corporate income taxes apportion corporate income by giving equal weight to geographical distribution of plant, payroll, and sales, the use of a formula based wholly on sales will result in multiple taxation and unfair allocation of corporate income.

Korman.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947 imposes a tax of 5% on the taxable income of every corporation, foreign or domestic, for the privilege of engaging in any trade or business within the District.\n1\n The Act further provides that \"[t]he measure of the franchise tax shall be that portion of the net income of the corporation . . . as is fairly attributable to any trade or business carried on or engaged in within the District and such other net income as is derived from sources within the District.\"\n2\n The Act does not attempt to define a specific method whereby the portion of income \"fairly attributable\" to the District is to be determined, but authorizes the District Commissioners to prescribe regulations for such determination.\n3\n However, the Commissioners' discretion in devising such regulations is not unfettered, as the Act further commands: \"If the trade or business of any corporation . . . is carried on or engaged \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 555]\n\u00a0\n in both within and without the District, the net income derived therefrom shall . . . be deemed to be income from sources within and without the District.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nActing pursuant to the authority delegated to formulate regulations governing the allocation of income, the District Commissioners promulgated regulations which provide: \"Where income for any taxable year is derived from the manufacture and sale or purchase and sale of tangible personal property, the portion thereof to be apportioned to the District shall be such percentage of the total of such income as the District sales made during such taxable year bear to the total sales made everywhere during such taxable year.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner, General Motors Corporation (G. M.), seeks review of an en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which approved the application of these regulations in determining the proportion of its total net income allocable to the District for the purpose of computing the franchise tax due.\n6\n General Motors attacks this method of computation on the grounds that it attributes to the District an unreasonably high proportion of its total income and that it is therefore both unauthorized by the relevant sections of the statute, and violative of the Interstate Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution. We agree that this method of allocation is not authorized by the D.C. Code and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals without reaching the constitutional questions raised. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Motors is engaged in the manufacture and sale of motor vehicles, parts, and accessories. A Delaware corporation, the petitioner maintains its principal offices in New York and Detroit. It carries on no manufacturing operations within the District of Columbia, but it makes substantial sales to customers located within the District, chiefly retail automobile dealers. During the years in question, 1957 and 1958, its volume of sales to such customers aggregated $37,185,704 and $32,542,519, respectively.\n7\n Orders for these sales were received and filled outside the District, and the products were shipped to customers from G. M. manufacturing plants in Maryland. Delaware, and Michigan.\n\nIt is the claim of G. M. that the use of the \"sales-factor formula\" in the regulations is beyond the authority of the statute, because that formula taxes more of its net income than is \"fairly attributable\" to its District of Columbia business, particularly in light of the statutory provision which provides that the net income of a business carried on both within and without the District shall be deemed to be from sources within and without the District. We agree that the Commissioners exceeded their statutory authority by allocating income to the District in disregard of the express restrictions of the law.\n\nWe are normally content to leave undisturbed decisions by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concerning the import of legislation governing the affairs of the District. However, at times application of the District Code has an impact not confined to the Potomac's shores, but reaching far beyond. This is such a case, for approval of the District Commissioners' regulations lends sanction to an apportionment formula seriously at variance with those prevailing in the vast majority of States and creates substantial dangers of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n multiple taxation. Where a decision is of such significance to interstate commerce, and where the result reached involves statutorily unsupportable exertions of administrative power, the traditional reasons underlying our customary refusal to review interpretations of District law do not apply.\n\nIt is of course clear that the District Code does not expressly prescribe the use of any particular formula for the apportionment of income to sources within and without the District. On the contrary, the Code expressly authorizes the District Commissioners to promulgate regulations for the detailed apportionment of the income of multistate enterprises. But neither does the Code leave the Commissioners wholly unguided in their exercise of this authority. The Commissioners' authority is clearly limited by the provision ( 47-1580a) which requires that the net income of a corporation doing business inside and outside the District be deemed to arise from sources situated in like fashion. To understand the meaning of this limitation, we need but take the simple example of a corporation which has its manufacturing facilities located wholly in Maryland and sells all of its products in the District of Columbia. Application of the Commissioners' formula would result in the allocation of 100% of the corporation's income to the District. Yet there can be no doubt that the business of the corporation is carried on both within and without the District, viz., manufacture in Maryland and sales in the District. The statute does not say that net income shall be deemed to be derived from sources within and without the District only where the sales of any corporation are made both within and without the District, which is the effect of the Commissioners' regulation. The statute is phrased more broadly and commands apportionment of income to sources within and without the District whenever \"the trade or business of any corporation . . . is carried on or \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n engaged in both within and without the District.\" As it is clear that some part of the trade or business of this hypothetical corporation is carried on without the District, the conclusion follows that the Commissioners must \"deem\" some part of the income of this corporation to be derived from sources outside the District.\n\nIt is said that the Commissioners' regulations are within the statutory grant of authority because the language \"the net income derived therefrom\" in 47-1580a must be read to mean the total income of the corporation and not the \"net income arising from activities in the District.\" The section must be so read, it is argued, because this reading least restricts the discretion of the Commissioners in devising apportionment formulae, and the traditional canon of broad construction of revenue measures demands that restrictions on the Commissioners' discretion be minimized. Applying this approach to the case at hand, it is argued that the Commissioners fulfilled their statutory obligation in apportioning the total income of G. M. to sources inside and outside the District in accordance with the geographical distribution of the company's sales.\n\nWhere, as in this case, some portion of a corporation's income is derived from manufacture and sale outside the District, there is no question that the statute requires the Commissioners to allocate that portion to sources outside the District.\n8\n However, it does not follow that the making of that kind of allocation alone relieves the Commissioners of their statutory responsibility to apportion that part of a corporation's income arising from manufacture outside and sale inside the District limits. As to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n this segment of its income, G. M. is in precisely the same situation as the hypothetical corporation manufacturing wholly in Maryland and selling solely in the District; that is, it is carrying on a business partly within and partly without the District limits. It is not enough under the statute to require apportionment of income derived from District sales only in the case where the taxed corporation has no sales outside the District. The inescapable and determinative fact in both the hypothetical case and the case before us is that the company carries on business both inside and outside the District with respect to the income which it derives from the sales made within the District. Consequently, 47-1580a requires that some portion of this income be deemed to arise from sources outside the District.\n\nThe conclusion which we reach by analysis of the plain language of the statute also finds support in the consequences which a contrary view would have for the overall pattern of taxation of income derived from interstate commerce. The great majority of States imposing corporate income taxes apportion the total income of a corporation by application of a three-factor formula which gives equal weight to the geographical distribution of plant, payroll, and sales.\n9\n The use of an apportionment formula based wholly on the sales factor, in the context of general use of the three-factor approach, will ordinarily result in multiple taxation of corporate net income; for \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n the States in which the property and payroll of the corporation are located will allocate to themselves 67% of the corporation's income, whereas the jurisdictions in which the sales are made will allocate 100% of the income to themselves. Conversely, in some cases enterprises will have their payroll and plant located in the sales-factor jurisdictions and make their sales in the three-factor jurisdictions so that only 33% of their incomes will be subject to state taxation. In any case, the sheer inconsistency of the District formula with that generally prevailing may tend to result in the unhealthy fragmentation of enterprise and an uneconomic pattern of plant location, and so presents an added reason why this Court must give proper meaning to the relevant provisions of the District Code.\n\nMoreover, the result reached in this case is consistent with the concern which the Court has shown that state taxes imposed on income from interstate commerce be fairly apportioned. In upholding taxes imposed on corporate income by Connecticut and New York and apportioned in accordance with the geographical distribution of a corporation's property, this Court carefully inquired into the reasonableness of the apportionment formulae used.\n\n\"The profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other States. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the State. The legislature in attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. . . . There is . . . nothing in this record to show that the method of apportionment adopted by the State was inherently arbitrary, or that its \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n application to this corporation produced an unreasonable result.\" Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n-121.\n\n\n See also Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd. v. State Tax Comm'n, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n. While the Court has refrained from attempting to define any single appropriate method of apportionment, it has sought to ensure that the methods used display a modicum of reasonable relation to corporate activities within the State. The Court has approved formulae based on the geographical distribution of corporate property and those based on the standard three-factor formula. See, e. g., Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, supra; Butler Bros. v. McColgan, \n315 \nU.S. 501\n. The standard three-factor formula can be justified as a rough, practical approximation of the distribution of either a corporation's sources of income or the social costs which it generates. By contrast, the geographic distribution of a corporation's sales is, by itself, of dubious significance in indicating the locus of either factor. We of course do not mean to take any position on the constitutionality of a state income tax based on the sales factor alone. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to note that the factors alluded to by this Court in justifying apportionment measures constitutionally challenged in the past lend little support to the use of an exclusively sales-oriented approach. In construing the District Code to prohibit the use of a sales-factor formula, we sacrifice none of the values which our scrutiny of state apportionment measures has sought to protect.\n\nIn sum, we find that the language of the authorizing statute does not permit the application of an apportionment formula which makes use of the sales factor alone. The conclusion which we draw from examination of the statutory language finds support in the conflict with other taxing jurisdictions which would result from a contrary view. It finds further support in the continuing concern \n\n[380 \nU.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n for fair apportionment which this Court has displayed over the years in scrutinizing state taxing statutes. As the District Code confides in the Commissioners the authority to prescribe detailed regulations, it is not for us to make specific prescription, and we limit ourselves to holding that the present regulation is unauthorized by the statute. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, agreeing with the Court of Appeals that the tax here is authorized by the controlling statute, would affirm the judgment.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] D.C.

PAN AMERICAN AIRWAYS(1965)\nNo. 919\nArgued: Decided: October 18, 1965\n\n\n         Petitioner's husband while off duty was killed outside an overseas defense base where he was employed. The Deputy Commissioner, Bureau of Employees' Compensation, Department of Labor, having found that at the time of the accident decedent was subject to emergency call and was returning from reasonable recreation, awarded petitioner death benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. The District Court set the award aside and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding no benefit to the employer in decedent's trip and no relation between the accident and his employment. This Court denied certiorari in the October 1961 Term and a petition for rehearing the next Term. Thereafter another Court of Appeals upheld an award arising from another employee's death in the same accident, relying on O'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., \n340 \nU.S. 504\n, which held that the Deputy Commissioner's award under the Act may be based on his finding that the obligations and conditions of employment create the \"zone of special danger\" out of which the injury or death arose. The Court of Appeals which decided this case expressed doubt in a subsequent case that its decision below conformed to Brown-Pacific-Maxon, and noted that but for a per curiam judgment (reversed last Term in O'Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., \n380 \nU.S. 359\n) the Gondeck case stood alone. Held: Since the Court of Appeals misinterpreted the standard in Brown-Pacific-Maxon and since of those eligible petitioner alone had not received compensation for the accident here involved, the \"interests of justice would make unfair the strict application of [the Court's] rules\" by which the litigation here would otherwise be final.

Gondeck, was killed as a result of a jeep accident on San Salvador Island outside a defense base at which he was employed. The accident took place in the evening as Gondeck and four others were returning from a nearby town. The Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, United States Department of Labor, awarded death benefits to petitioner in accordance with the terms of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq. (1958 ed.), as extended by the Defense Base Act, 55 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1651 et seq. (1958 ed.). In support of the award, the Deputy Commissioner found, among other things, that, although Gondeck had completed his day's work, he was subject to call for emergencies while off duty and was returning from reasonable recreation when the accident occurred. The District Court set aside the Deputy Commissioner's order, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. United States v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 299 F.2d 74. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Gondeck was subject to call, id., at 75, but found no benefit to the employer in Gondeck's trip, and \"no evidence that furnishes a link by which the activity in which Gondeck was engaged was related to his employment.\" Id., at 77.\n\nOn June 11, 1962, we denied certiorari. \n370 \nU.S. 918\n. On October 8, 1962, we denied a petition for rehearing. \n371 \nU.S. 856\n. We are now apprised, however, of \"intervening circumstances of substantial . . . effect,\"\n*\n justifying application of the established doctrine that \"the interest in finality of litigation must yield where the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n interests of justice would make unfair the strict application of our rules.\" United States v. Ohio Power Co., \n353 \nU.S. 98, 99\n. Subsequent to our orders in the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld an award to the survivors of another employee killed in the same accident. Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Hearne, 335 F.2d 70. In upholding the award, the court cited our decision in O'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., \n340 \nU.S. 504\n. In a subsequent case the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit itself expressed doubt whether its decision in the present case had been consistent with Brown-Pacific-Maxon. O'Keeffe v. Pan American World Airways, 338 F.2d 319, 325. The Court also noted that, \"The Gondeck case stands alone, except for a per curiam opinion.\" Id., at 325. This Court reversed that per curiam judgment last Term, O'Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., \n380 \nU.S. 359\n, so that the present case now stands completely alone.\n\nIn O'Keeffe we made clear that the determinations of the Deputy Commissioner are subject only to limited judicial review, and we reaffirmed the Brown-Pacific-Maxon holding that the Deputy Commissioner need not find a causal relation between the nature of the victim's employment and the accident, nor that the victim was engaged in activity of benefit to the employer at the time of his injury or death. No more is required than that the obligations or conditions of employment create the \"zone of special danger\" out of which the injury or death arose. Since the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted the Brown-Pacific-Maxon standard in this case, and since, of those eligible for compensation from the accident, this petitioner stands alone in not receiving it, \"the interests of justice would make unfair the strict application of our rules.\" United States v. Ohio Power Co., supra, at 99. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe therefore grant the motion for leave to file the petition for rehearing, grant the petition for rehearing, vacate the order denying certiorari, grant the petition for certiorari, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] U.S. Supreme Ct. Rule 58 (2).\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, joining in the judgment.\n\nI fully agree with my Brother HARLAN \"that litigation must at some point come to an end\" and \"that this decision holds seeds of mischief for the future orderly administration of justice . . . .\" But with Cahill v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 183\n (1956), on our books, no other conclusion can be reached.\n\nUp until Cahill I thought that successive petitions for rehearing would not be received by the Court under its Rule 58 (4).\n1\n This rule took the place of the old \"end of Term\" rule of Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 \nU.S. 410, 415\n (1882), abolished by the Congress in 1948, 28 U.S.C. 452 (1958 ed.). Indeed, I doubted that the Court had the power to grant a successive petition for rehearing under a factual situation, as here, where a petition for certiorari had been denied over three years ago, \n370 \nU.S. 918\n (1962); a petition for rehearing had been denied, \n371 \nU.S. 856\n (1962); the mandate had issued more than three years before; and where petitioner had, about the same date, cancelled her appeal bond and been discharged of all liability thereunder. In Cahill, however, the Court through the device of a \"motion to recall and amend the judgment\" permitted a successive petition \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n not only to be received but granted, despite the fact that the judgment thereby reopened had been previously paid.\n2\n This paved the way for the grant of a successive petition for rehearing in United States v. Ohio Power Co., \n353 \nU.S. 98\n (1957), to make its judgment conform with this Court's decision that same Term in United States v. Allen-Bradley Co., \n352 \nU.S. 306\n (1957), a companion case of Ohio Power in the Court of Claims.\n\nThe vice, of course, is the granting of successive petitions for rehearing in violation of Rule 58 (4), which was done for the first time in Cahill. It makes no difference that the rejection of finality be to correct alleged errors of our own or those below. Nor does it matter that the errors be corrected in the same Term, as in Cahill, or four Terms later, as here. In each instance the action violates Rule 58 (4) and that is the basis of my position.\n\nI, too, as my Brother HARLAN said in Ohio Power, \"can think of nothing more unsettling to lawyers and litigants, and more disturbing to their confidence in the evenhandedness of the Court's processes, than to be left in . . . uncertainty . . . as to when their cases may be considered finally closed in this Court.\" At p. 111 (dissenting opinion). However, Cahill opened up this practice. It may be that Ohio Power and the present case are more objectionable on their facts, but they merely condone Cahill's original vice. Until we can gain the vote of the majority to the contrary we are stuck with the practice. The outlook for this appears dim. We can only hope that this rule of \"no finality,\" which the Court varnishes with the charms of reason, will be sparingly used, or overruled by Congress, as was the \"end of Term\" rule. I, therefore, join in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Consecutive petitions for rehearings, and petitions for rehearing that are out of time under this rule, will not be received.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] MR. JUSTICE BLACK, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and myself, dissented. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe result reached in this case has been achieved at the expense of the sound legal principle that litigation must at some point come to an end.\n\nI can find nothing in the train of events on which the Court relies in overturning this more than three-year-old final judgment that justifies bringing into play the dubious doctrine of United States v. Ohio Power Co., \n353 \nU.S. 98\n, a case which was decided by a closely divided vote of less than a full bench,\n1\n which deviated from long-established practices of this Court,\n2\n and which, so far as I can find, has had no sequel in subsequent decisions of the Court.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment against this petitioner became final as long ago as June 11, 1962. \n370 \nU.S. 918\n. The Court refused to reconsider it four months later when it denied rehearing on October 8, 1962. \n371 \nU.S. 856\n. When some two years later, July 13, 1964, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld a compensation award with respect to a co-employee of Gondeck killed in the same accident, Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Hearne, 335 F.2d 70, petitioner did not even seek to file another petition for rehearing here. A few months later the Fifth Circuit might be thought to have indicated some doubt about its earlier decision in the Gondeck case, O'Keeffe v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 338 F.2d 319, 325, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n but again no attempt was made to file a further petition for rehearing here in Gondeck.\n\nIt was this Court's decision of last Term in O'Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., \n380 \nU.S. 359\n, which itself was a debatable innovation in this area of the law,\n4\n that triggered the undoing of this judgment of four Terms ago. It should be noted that the subject matter in O'Keeffe v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., was an entirely different accident from the one in which petitioner's decedent was involved.\n\nThis, then, is hardly one of those rare cases in which \"`the interest in finality of litigation must yield'\" because \"`the interests of justice would make unfair the strict application of our rules,'\" ante, pp. 26-27. On the contrary, the situation is one in which the prevailing party in this litigation had every reason to count on the judgment in its favor remaining firm. Believing that this decision holds seeds of mischief for the future orderly administration of justice, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The vote was 4 to 3, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and Mr. Justice Whittaker, since retired, not participating. \n353 \nU.S., at 99\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See dissenting opinion of HARLAN, J., \n353 \nU.S., at 99\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] My Brother CLARK'S citation of Cahill v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 183\n, ante, p. 28, for the proposition that this petition for rehearing must be granted is inapposite. Cahill was an FELA case in which this Court reversed summarily a judgment of the Court of Appeals overturning a district court judgment for the plaintiff, \n350 \nU.S. 898\n. Later that same Term, after a petition for rehearing had been denied, \n350 \nU.S. 943\n, the Court was persuaded on \"a \n\n[382 \nU.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n motion to recall and amend the judgment\" that its mandate, which simply reinstated the District Court's judgment, was incorrect and that the case should properly have been remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings. It is difficult for me to see how the correction during the same Term of our own error in Cahill can be thought to compel or justify a general \"rule of `no finality'\" (as my Brother CLARK puts it, ante, p. 29) which requires the granting of a second petition for rehearing three years after the first one was denied in a case which this Court never heard.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The case was decided without argument by a substantially divided Court, \n380 \nU.S. 359\n.

CALIFORNIA(1965)\nNo. 202\nArgued: March 9, 1965Decided: April 28, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Comment to the jury by a prosecutor in a state criminal trial upon a defendant's failure to testify as to matters which he can reasonably be expected to deny or explain because of facts within his knowledge or by the court that the defendant's silence under those circumstances evidences guilt violates the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n. Pp. 610-615.\n\n 60 Cal. 2d 182, 383 P.2d 432, reversed.\n\nMorris Lavine argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.\n\nAlbert W. Harris, Jr., Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General, Arlo E. Smith, Chief Assistant Attorney General, and Derald E. Granberg, Deputy Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was convicted of murder in the first degree after a jury trial in a California court. He did not testify at the trial on the issue of guilt, though he did testify at the separate trial\n1\n on the issue of penalty. The trial court instructed the jury on the issue of guilt, stating \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 610]\n\u00a0\n that a defendant has a constitutional right not to testify. But it told the jury:\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\"As to any evidence or facts against him which the defendant can reasonably be expected to deny or explain because of facts within his knowledge, if he does not testify or if, though he does testify, he fails to deny or explain such evidence, the jury may take that failure into consideration as tending to indicate the truth of such evidence and as indicating that among the inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom those unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable.\"\n\n\n It added, however, that no such inference could be drawn as to evidence respecting which he had no knowledge. It stated that failure of a defendant to deny or explain the evidence of which he had knowledge does not create a presumption of guilt nor by itself warrant an inference of guilt nor relieve the prosecution of any of its burden of proof.\n\nPetitioner had been seen with the deceased the evening of her death, the evidence placing him with her in the alley where her body was found. The prosecutor made much of the failure of petitioner to testify:\n\n \"The defendant certainly knows whether Essie Mae had this beat up appearance at the time he left her apartment and went down the alley with her.\n\n\n \"What kind of a man is it that would want to have sex with a woman that beat up if she was beat up at the time he left? \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 611]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"He would know that. He would know how she got down the alley. He would know how the blood got on the bottom of the concrete steps. He would know how long he was with her in that box. He would know how her wig got off. He would know whether he beat her or mistreated her. He would know whether he walked away from that place cool as a cucumber when he saw Mr. Villasenor because he was conscious of his own guilt and wanted to get away from that damaged or injured woman.\n\n\n \"These things he has not seen fit to take the stand and deny or explain.\n\n\n \"And in the whole world, if anybody would know, this defendant would know.\n\n\n \"Essie Mae is dead, she can't tell you her side of the story. The defendant won't.\"\n\n\n The death penalty was imposed and the California Supreme Court affirmed. 60 Cal. 2d 182, 383 P.2d 432. The case is here on a writ of certiorari which we granted, \n377 \nU.S. 989\n, to consider whether comment on the failure to testify violated the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment which we made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth in Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n, decided after the Supreme Court of California had affirmed the present conviction.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 612]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf this were a federal trial, reversible error would have been committed. Wilson v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 60\n, so holds. It is said, however, that the Wilson decision rested not on the Fifth Amendment, but on an Act of Congress, now 18 U.S.C. 3481.\n4\n That indeed is the fact, as the opinion of the Court in the Wilson case states. And see Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 50\n, n. 6; \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 613]\n\u00a0\n Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287, 294\n. But that is the beginning, not the end, of our inquiry. The question remains whether, statute or not, the comment rule, approved by California, violates the Fifth Amendment.\n\nWe think it does. It is in substance a rule of evidence that allows the State the privilege of tendering to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to testify. No formal offer of proof is made as in other situations; but the prosecutor's comment and the court's acquiescence are the equivalent of an offer of evidence and its acceptance. The Court in the Wilson case stated:\n\n \". . . the act was framed with a due regard also to those who might prefer to rely upon the presumption of innocence which the law gives to every one, and not wish to be witnesses. It is not every one who can safely venture on the witness stand though entirely innocent of the charge against him. Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character, and offences charged against him, will often confuse and embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices against him. It is not every one, however honest, who would, therefore, willingly be placed on the witness stand. The statute, in tenderness to the weakness of those who from the causes mentioned might refuse to ask to be a witness, particularly when they may have been in some degree compromised by their association with others, declares that the failure of the defendant in a criminal action to request to be a witness shall not create any presumption against him.\" 149 U.S., p. 66.\n\n\n If the words \"Fifth Amendment\" are substituted for \"act\" and for \"statute,\" the spirit of the Self-Incrimination \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 614]\n\u00a0\n Clause is reflected. For comment on the refusal to testify is a remnant of the \"inquisitorial system of criminal justice,\" Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, \n378 \nU.S. 52, 55\n, which the Fifth Amendment outlaws.\n5\n It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly. It is said, however, that the inference of guilt for failure to testify as to facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge is in any event natural and irresistible, and that comment on the failure does not magnify that inference into a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege. People v. Modesto, 62 Cal. 2d 436, 452-453, 398 P.2d 753, 762-763. What the jury may infer, given no help from the court, is one thing. What it may infer when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him is quite another. That the inference \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 615]\n\u00a0\n of guilt is not always so natural or irresistible is brought out in the Modesto opinion itself:\n\n \"Defendant contends that the reason a defendant refuses to testify is that his prior convictions will be introduced in evidence to impeach him ([Cal.] Code Civ. Proc. 2051) and not that he is unable to deny the accusations. It is true that the defendant might fear that his prior convictions will prejudice the jury, and therefore another possible inference can be drawn from his refusal to take the stand.\" Id., p. 453, 398 P.2d, p. 763.\n\n\n We said in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, p. 11, that \"the same standards must determine whether an accused's silence in either a federal or state proceeding is justified.\" We take that in its literal sense and hold that the Fifth Amendment, in its direct application to the Federal Government, and in its bearing on the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Penal Code 190.1, providing for separate trials on the two issues.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article I, 13, of the California Constitution provides in part: \". . . in any criminal case, whether the defendant testifies or not, his failure to explain or to deny by his testimony any evidence or facts in the case against him may be commented upon by the court and by counsel, and may be considered by the court or the jury.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The California Supreme Court later held in People v. Modesto, 62 Cal. 2d 436, 398 P.2d 753, that its \"comment\" rule squared with Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n. The overwhelming consensus of the States, however, is opposed to allowing comment on the defendant's failure to testify. The legislatures or courts of 44 States have recognized that such comment is, in light of the privilege against self-incrimination, \"an unwarrantable line of argument.\" State v. Howard, 35 S. C. 197, 203, 14 S. E. 481, 483. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence 2272, n. 2 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961 and 1964 Supp.). Of the six States which permit comment, two, California and Ohio, give this permission by means of an explicit constitutional qualification of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 612]\n\u00a0\n privilege against self-incrimination. Cal. Const., Art. I 13; Ohio Const., Art. I, 10. New Jersey permits comment, State v. Corby, 28 N. J. 106, 145 A. 2d 289; cf. State v. Garvin, 44 N. J. 268, 208 A. 2d 402; but its constitution contains no provision embodying the privilege against self-incrimination (see Laba v. Newark Bd. of Educ., 23 N. J. 364, 389, 129 A. 2d 273, 287; State v. White, 27 N. J. 158, 168-169, 142 A. 2d 65, 70). The absence of an express constitutional privilege against self-incrimination also puts Iowa among the six. See State v. Ferguson, 226 Iowa 361, 372-373, 283 N. W. 917, 923. Connecticut permits comment by the judge but not by the prosecutor. State v. Heno, 119 Conn. 29, 174 A. 181. New Mexico permits comment by the prosecutor but holds that the accused is then entitled to an instruction that \"the jury shall indulge no presumption against the accused because of his failure to testify.\" N. M. Stat. Ann. 41-12-19; State v. Sandoval, 59 N. M. 85, 279 P.2d 850.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 3481 reads as follows: \"In trial of all persons charged with the commission of offenses against the United States and in all proceedings in courts martial and courts of inquiry in any State, District, Possession or Territory, the person charged shall, at his own request, be a competent witness. His failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.\" June 25, 1948, c. 645, 62 Stat. 833. The legislative history shows that 18 U.S.C. 3481 was designed, inter alia, to bar counsel for the prosecution from commenting on the defendant's refusal to testify. Mr. Frye of Maine, spokesman for the bill, said, \"That is the law of Massachusetts, and we propose to adopt it as a law of the United States.\" 7 Cong. Rec. 385. The reference was to Mass. Stat. 1866, c. 260, now Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c. 233, 20, cl. Third (1959), which is almost identical with 18 U.S.C. 3481. See also Commonwealth v. Harlow, 110 Mass. 411; Commonwealth v. Scott, 123 Mass. 239; Opinion of the Justices, 300 Mass. 620, 15 N. E. 2d 662.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Our decision today that the Fifth Amendment prohibits comment on the defendant's silence is no innovation, for on a previous occasion a majority of this Court indicated their acceptance of this proposition. In Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n, the question was, as here, whether the Fifth Amendment proscribed California's comment practice. The four dissenters (BLACK, DOUGLAS, Murphy and Rutledge, JJ.) would have answered this question in the affirmative. A fifth member of the Court, Justice Frankfurter, stated in a separate opinion: \"For historical reasons a limited immunity from the common duty to testify was written into the Federal Bill of Rights, and I am prepared to agree that, as part of that immunity, comment on the failure of an accused to take the witness stand is forbidden in federal prosecutions.\" Id., p. 61. But, though he agreed with the dissenters on this point, he also agreed with Justices Vinson, Reed, Jackson, and Burton that the Fourteenth Amendment did not make the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States; thus he joined the opinion of the Court which so held (the Court's opinion assumed that the Fifth Amendment barred comment, but it expressly disclaimed any intention to decide the point. Id., p. 50).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] We reserve decision on whether an accused can require, as in Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287\n, that the jury be instructed that his silence must be disregarded.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that within the federal judicial system the Fifth Amendment bars adverse comment by federal prosecutors and judges on a defendant's failure to take the stand in a criminal trial, a right accorded him by that amendment. And given last Term's decision in Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n, that the Fifth Amendment applies \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 616]\n\u00a0\n to the States in all its refinements, I see no legitimate escape from today's decision and therefore concur in it. I do so, however, with great reluctance, since for me the decision exemplifies the creeping paralysis with which this Court's recent adoption of the \"incorporation\" doctrine is infecting the operation of the federal system. See my opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, ante, p. 400, at 408.\n\nWhile I would agree that the accusatorial rather than inquisitorial process is a fundamental part of the \"liberty\" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, my Brother STEWART in dissent, post, p. 617, fully demonstrates that the no-comment rule \"might be lost, and justice still be done,\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n. As a \"non-fundamental\" part of the Fifth Amendment (cf. my opinion concurring in the result in Pointer, at 409), I would not, but for Malloy, apply the no-comment rule to the States.\n\nMalloy put forward a single argument for applying the Fifth Amendment, as such, to the States:\n\n\"It would be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of privilege . . ., depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court. Therefore, the same standards must determine whether an accused's silence in either a federal or state proceeding is justified.\" Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 11. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n My answer then (\n378 \nU.S., at 27\n) and now is that \"incongruity,\" within the limits of fundamental fairness, is at the heart of our federal system. The powers and responsibilities of the State and Federal Governments are not congruent, and under the Constitution they are not intended to be.\n\nIt has also recently been suggested that measuring state procedures against standards of fundamental fairness as reflected in such landmark decisions as Twining v. New \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 617]\n\u00a0\n Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, and Palko v. Connecticut, supra, \"would require this Court to intervene in the state judicial process with considerable lack of predictability and with a consequent likelihood of considerable friction,\" Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 413-414 (concurring opinion of GOLDBERG, J.). This approach to the requirements of federalism, not unlike that evinced by the Court in Henry v. Mississippi, \n379 \nU.S. 443\n, apparently leads, in cases like this, to the conclusion that the way to eliminate friction with state judicial systems is not to attempt a working harmony, but to override them altogether.\n\nAlthough compelled to concur in this decision, I am free to express the hope that the Court will eventually return to constitutional paths which, until recently, it has followed throughout its history.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE WHITE joins, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioner chose not to take the witness stand at his trial upon a charge of first-degree murder in a California court. Article I, 13, of the California Constitution establishes a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination and further provides:\n\n \"[I]n any criminal case, whether the defendant  testifies or not, his failure to explain or to deny by his  testimony any evidence or facts in the case against  him may be commented upon by the court and by  counsel, and may be considered by the court or the  jury.\"\n\n\n In conformity with this provision, the prosecutor in his argument to the jury emphasized that a person accused of crime in a public forum would ordinarily deny or explain the evidence against him if he truthfully could do so.\n1\n Also in conformity with this California constitutional \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 618]\n\u00a0\n provision, the judge instructed the jury in the following terms:\n\n \"It is a constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal  trial that he may not be compelled to testify.  Thus, whether or not he does testify rests entirely  in his own decision. As to any evidence or facts  against him which the defendant can reasonably be  expected to deny or explain because of facts within  his knowledge, if he does not testify, or if, though he  does testify, he fails to deny or explain such evidence,  the jury may take that failure into consideration as  tending to indicate the truth of such evidence and as  indicating that among the inferences that may be  reasonably drawn therefrom those unfavorable to  the defendant are the more probable. In this connection,  however, it should be noted that if a defendant  does not have the knowledge that he would  need to deny or to explain any certain evidence  against him, it would be unreasonable to draw an  inference unfavorable to him because of his failure  to deny or to explain such evidence. The failure of a  defendant to deny or explain evidence against him  does not create a presumption of guilt or by itself  warrant an inference of guilt, nor does it relieve the  prosecution of its burden of proving every essential  element of the crime and the guilt of the defendant  beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\n The jury found the petitioner guilty as charged, and his conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of California.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 619]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo claim is made that the prosecutor's argument or the trial judge's instructions to the jury in this case deprived the petitioner of due process of law as such. This Court long ago decided that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not of its own force forbid this kind of comment on a defendant's failure to testify. Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n; Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n. The Court holds, however, that the California constitutional provision violates the Fifth Amendment's injunction that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\" an injunction which the Court less than a year ago for the first time found was applicable to trials in the courts of the several States.\n\nWith both candor and accuracy, the Court concedes that the question before us is one of first impression here.\n3\n It is a question which has not arisen before, because until last year the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment had been held to apply only to federal proceedings, and in the federal judicial system the matter has been \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 620]\n\u00a0\n covered by a specific Act of Congress which has been in effect ever since defendants have been permitted to testify at all in federal criminal trials.\n4\n See Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287\n; Wilson v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 60\n; Adamson v. California, supra.\n\nWe must determine whether the petitioner has been \"compelled . . . to be a witness against himself.\" Compulsion is the focus of the inquiry. Certainly, if any compulsion be detected in the California procedure, it is of a dramatically different and less palpable nature than that involved in the procedures which historically gave rise to the Fifth Amendment guarantee. When a suspect was brought before the Court of High Commission or the Star Chamber, he was commanded to answer whatever was asked of him, and subjected to a far-reaching and deeply probing inquiry in an effort to ferret out some unknown and frequently unsuspected crime. He declined to answer on pain of incarceration, banishment, or mutilation. And if he spoke falsely, he was subject to further punishment. Faced with this formidable array of alternatives, his decision to speak was unquestionably coerced.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThose were the lurid realities which lay behind enactment of the Fifth Amendment, a far cry from the subject matter of the case before us. I think that the Court in this case stretches the concept of compulsion beyond all reasonable bounds, and that whatever compulsion may exist derives from the defendant's choice not to testify, not from any comment by court or counsel. In support of its conclusion that the California procedure does compel the accused to testify, the Court has only this to say: \"It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly.\" Exactly what the penalty \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 621]\n\u00a0\n imposed consists of is not clear. It is not, as I understand the problem, that the jury becomes aware that the defendant has chosen not to testify in his own defense, for the jury will, of course, realize this quite evident fact, even though the choice goes unmentioned. Since comment by counsel and the court does not compel testimony by creating such an awareness, the Court must be saying that the California constitutional provision places some other compulsion upon the defendant to incriminate himself, some compulsion which the Court does not describe and which I cannot readily perceive.\n\nIt is not at all apparent to me, on any realistic view of the trial process, that a defendant will be at more of a disadvantage under the California practice than he would be in a court which permitted no comment at all on his failure to take the witness stand. How can it be said that the inferences drawn by a jury will be more detrimental to a defendant under the limiting and carefully controlling language of the instruction here involved than would result if the jury were left to roam at large with only its untutored instincts to guide it, to draw from the defendant's silence broad inferences of guilt? The instructions in this case expressly cautioned the jury that the defendant's failure to testify \"does not create a presumption of guilt or by itself warrant an inference of guilt\"; it was further admonished that such failure does not \"relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving every essential element of the crime,\" and finally the trial judge warned that the prosecution's burden remained that of proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Whether the same limitations would be observed by a jury without the benefit of protective instructions shielding the defendant is certainly open to real doubt.\n\nMoreover, no one can say where the balance of advantage might lie as a result of the attorneys' discussion of the matter. No doubt the prosecution's argument will seek to encourage the drawing of inferences unfavorable to the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 622]\n\u00a0\n defendant. However, the defendant's counsel equally has an opportunity to explain the various other reasons why a defendant may not wish to take the stand, and thus rebut the natural if uneducated assumption that it is because the defendant cannot truthfully deny the accusations made.\n\nI think the California comment rule is not a coercive device which impairs the right against self-incrimination, but rather a means of articulating and bringing into the light of rational discussion a fact inescapably impressed on the jury's consciousness. The California procedure is not only designed to protect the defendant against unwarranted inferences which might be drawn by an uninformed jury; it is also an attempt by the State to recognize and articulate what it believes to be the natural probative force of certain facts. Surely no one would deny that the State has an important interest in throwing the light of rational discussion on that which transpires in the course of a trial, both to protect the defendant from the very real dangers of silence and to shape a legal process designed to ascertain the truth.\n\nThe California rule allowing comment by counsel and instruction by the judge on the defendant's failure to take the stand is hardly an idiosyncratic aberration. The Model Code of Evidence, and the Uniform Rules of Evidence both sanction the use of such procedures.\n6\n The practice has been endorsed by resolution of the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute,\n7\n and has the support of the weight of scholarly opinion.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 609, 623]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe formulation of procedural rules to govern the administration of criminal justice in the various States is properly a matter of local concern. We are charged with no general supervisory power over such matters; our only legitimate function is to prevent violations of the Constitution's commands. California has honored the constitutional command that no person shall \"be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" The petitioner was not compelled to testify, and he did not do so. But whenever in a jury trial a defendant exercises this constitutional right, the members of the jury are bound to draw inferences from his silence. No constitution can prevent the operation of the human mind. Without limiting instructions, the danger exists that the inferences drawn by the jury may be unfairly broad. Some States have permitted this danger to go unchecked, by forbidding any comment at all upon the defendant's failure to take the witness stand.\n9\n Other States have dealt with this danger in a variety of ways, as the Court's opinion indicates. Ante, note 3, at pp. 611-612. Some might differ, as a matter of policy, with the way California has chosen to deal with the problem, or even disapprove of the judge's specific instructions in this case.\n10\n But, so long as the constitutional command is obeyed. such matters of state policy are not for this Court to decide.\n\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the excerpt from the prosecutor's argument quoted in the Court's opinion, ante, pp. 610-611.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 60 Cal. 2d 182, 383 P.2d 432. As this case was decided before Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n, the California Supreme Court did not give plenary consideration to the question now before us; however, that court has since upheld the federal constitutionality of the California comment rule in a thoroughly reasoned opinion by Chief Justice Traynor. People v. Modesto, 62 Cal. 2d 436, 398 P.2d 753.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In the Adamson case, the present question was not reached because the majority ruled that the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States. Mr. Justice Reed's opinion made clear that the California rule was only assumed to contravene the Fifth Amendment, \"without any intention . . . of ruling upon the issue.\" The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS read the majority opinion as \"strongly imply[ing] that the Fifth Amendment does not, of itself, bar comment upon failure to testify,\" but they considered the case on the majority's assumption, thereby giving no approval to that assumption, even in dictum. That no such approval was given by this dissenting opinion is further made evident by the fact that Mr. Justice Murphy and Mr. Justice Rutledge, also in dissent, felt it necessary to make what they characterized as an \"addition,\" an expression of their view that the guarantee against self-incrimination had been violated in the case. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in concurring, also indicated that he was prepared to agree that the Fifth Amendment barred comment, thus bringing to three the members of the Court who, in dicta, took the view embraced by the Court today.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 20 Stat. 30, as amended, now 18 U.S.C. 3481.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See generally 8 Wigmore, Evidence 2250 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Model Code of Evidence, Rule 201 (1942); Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rule 23 (4) (1953).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 56 A.

CONNECTICUT(1965)\nNo. 496\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appellants, the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, and its medical director, a licensed physician, were convicted as accessories for giving married persons information and medical advice on how to prevent conception and, following examination, prescribing a contraceptive device or material for the wife's use. A Connecticut statute makes it a crime for any person to use any drug or article to prevent conception. Appellants claimed that the accessory statute as applied violated the Fourteenth Amendment. An intermediate appellate court and the State's highest court affirmed the judgment. Held:\n\n 1. Appellants have standing to assert the constitutional rights of the married people. Tileston v. Ullman, \n318 \nU.S. 44\n, distinguished. P. 481.\n\n\n 2. The Connecticut statute forbidding use of contraceptives violates the right of marital privacy which is within the penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Pp. 481-486.\n\n\n 151 Conn. 544, 200 A. 2d 479, reversed.\n\nThomas I. Emerson argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs was Catherine G. Roraback.\n\nJoseph B. Clark argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Julius Maretz.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging reversal, were filed by Whitney North Seymour and Eleanor M. Fox for Dr. John M. Adams et al.; by Morris L. Ernst, Harriet F. Pilpel and Nancy F. Wechsler for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.; by Alfred L. Scanlon for the Catholic Council on Civil Liberties, and by Rhoda H. Karpatkin, Melvin L. Wulf and Jerome E. Caplan for the American Civil Liberties Union et al. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellant Griswold is Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. Appellant Buxton is a licensed physician and a professor at the Yale Medical School who served as Medical Director for the League at its Center in New Haven - a center open and operating from November 1 to November 10, 1961, when appellants were arrested.\n\nThey gave information, instruction, and medical advice to married persons as to the means of preventing conception. They examined the wife and prescribed the best contraceptive device or material for her use. Fees were usually charged, although some couples were serviced free.\n\nThe statutes whose constitutionality is involved in this appeal are 53-32 and 54-196 of the General Statutes of Connecticut (1958 rev.). The former provides:\n\n  \"Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article  or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception  shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned  not less than sixty days nor more than one  year or be both fined and imprisoned.\"\n\n\n Section 54-196 provides:\n\n \"Any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes, hires or commands another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\"\n\n\n The appellants were found guilty as accessories and fined $100 each, against the claim that the accessory statute as so applied violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court affirmed. The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed that judgment. 151 Conn. 544, 200 A. 2d 479. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n379 \nU.S. 926\n. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think that appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship. Tileston v. Ullman, \n318 \nU.S. 44\n, is different, for there the plaintiff seeking to represent others asked for a declaratory judgment. In that situation we thought that the requirements of standing should be strict, lest the standards of \"case or controversy\" in Article III of the Constitution become blurred. Here those doubts are removed by reason of a criminal conviction for serving married couples in violation of an aiding-and-abetting statute. Certainly the accessory should have standing to assert that the offense which he is charged with assisting is not, or cannot constitutionally be, a crime.\n\nThis case is more akin to Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n, where an employee was permitted to assert the rights of his employer; to Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, where the owners of private schools were entitled to assert the rights of potential pupils and their parents; and to Barrows v. Jackson, \n346 \nU.S. 249\n, where a white defendant, party to a racially restrictive covenant, who was being sued for damages by the covenantors because she had conveyed her property to Negroes, was allowed to raise the issue that enforcement of the covenant violated the rights of prospective Negro purchasers to equal protection, although no Negro was a party to the suit. And see Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n; Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415\n. The rights of husband and wife, pressed here, are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless those rights are considered in a suit involving those who have this kind of confidential relation to them.\n\nComing to the merits, we are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Overtones of some arguments \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n suggest that Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45\n, should be our guide. But we decline that invitation as we did in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n; Olsen v. Nebraska, \n313 \nU.S. 236\n; Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co., \n335 \nU.S. 525\n; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483\n; Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n. We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. This law, however, operates directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation.\n\nThe association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights. The right to educate a child in a school of the parents' choice - whether public or private or parochial - is also not mentioned. Nor is the right to study any particular subject or any foreign language. Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain of those rights.\n\nBy Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, the right to educate one's children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. By Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school. In other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge. The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read (Martin v. Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141, 143\n) and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach (see Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183, 195\n) - indeed the freedom of the entire university community. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234, 249\n-250, 261-263; Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 112\n; Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 369\n. Without \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less secure. And so we reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the Meyer cases.\n\nIn NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449, 462\n, we protected the \"freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations,\" noting that freedom of association was a peripheral First Amendment right. Disclosure of membership lists of a constitutionally valid association, we held, was invalid \"as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of association.\" Ibid. In other words, the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion. In like context, we have protected forms of \"association\" that are not political in the customary sense but pertain to the social, legal, and economic benefit of the members. NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 430\n-431. In Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n, we held it not permissible to bar a lawyer from practice, because he had once been a member of the Communist Party. The man's \"association with that Party\" was not shown to be \"anything more than a political faith in a political party\" (id., at 244) and was not action of a kind proving bad moral character. Id., at 245-246.\n\nThose cases involved more than the \"right of assembly\" - a right that extends to all irrespective of their race or ideology. De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353\n. The right of \"association,\" like the right of belief (Board of Education v. Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624\n), is more than the right to attend a meeting; it includes the right to express one's attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means. Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion; and while it is not expressly included in the First Amendment its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. See Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 516\n-522 (dissenting opinion). Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers \"in any house\" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n\nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 630\n, as protection against all governmental invasions \"of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.\"\n*\n We recently referred \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n in Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 656\n, to the Fourth Amendment as creating a \"right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people.\" See Beaney, The Constitutional Right to Privacy, 1962 Sup. Ct. Rev. 212; Griswold, The Right to be Let Alone, 55 Nw. U. L. Rev. 216 (1960).\n\nWe have had many controversies over these penumbral rights of \"privacy and repose.\" See, e. g., Breard v. Alexandria, \n341 \nU.S. 622, 626\n, 644; Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, \n343 \nU.S. 451\n; Monroe v. Pape, \n365 \nU.S. 167\n; Lanza v. New York, \n370 \nU.S. 139\n; Frank v. Maryland, \n359 \nU.S. 360\n; Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535, 541\n. These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.\n\nThe present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that a \"governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.\" NAACP v. Alabama, \n377 \nU.S. 288, 307\n. Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.\n\nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights - older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The Court said in full about this right of privacy:\n\n\"The principles laid down in this opinion [by Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029] affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employes of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offence, - it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n Lord Camden's judgment. Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.\" \n116 \nU.S., at 630\n.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE GOLDBERG, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that Connecticut's birth-control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of marital privacy, and I join in its opinion and judgment. Although I have not accepted the view that \"due process\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates all of the first eight Amendments (see my concurring opinion in Pointer v. Texas, \n380 \nU.S. 400, 410\n, and the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in Cohen v. Hurley, \n366 \nU.S. 117, 154\n), I do agree that the concept of liberty protects those personal rights that are fundamental, and is not confined to the specific terms of the Bill of Rights. My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted and that it embraces the right of marital privacy though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution\n1\n is supported both by numerous \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n decisions of this Court, referred to in the Court's opinion, and by the language and history of the Ninth Amendment. In reaching the conclusion that the right of marital privacy is protected, as being within the protected penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights, the Court refers to the Ninth Amendment, ante, at 484. I add these words to emphasize the relevance of that Amendment to the Court's holding.\n\nThe Court stated many years ago that the Due Process Clause protects those liberties that are \"so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 105\n. In Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, the Court said:\n\n \"For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press - which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress - are among the fundamental personal rights and `liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.\" (Emphasis added.) \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n And, in Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, the Court, referring to the Fourteenth Amendment, stated:\n\n  \"While this Court has not attempted to define with  exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has  received much consideration and some of the included  things have been definitely stated. Without  doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily  restraint but also [for example,] the right . . . to  marry, establish a home and bring up children . . . .\"\n\n\n This Court, in a series of decisions, has held that the Fourteenth Amendment absorbs and applies to the States those specifics of the first eight amendments which express fundamental personal rights.\n2\n The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments.\n\nThe Ninth Amendment reads, \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" The Amendment is almost entirely the work of James Madison. It was introduced in Congress by him and passed the House and Senate with little or no debate and virtually no change in language. It was proffered to quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights\n3\n could not be sufficiently broad to cover all essential \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n rights and that the specific mention of certain rights would be interpreted as a denial that others were protected.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn presenting the proposed Amendment, Madison said:\n\n  \"It has been objected also against a bill of rights,  that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the  grant of power, it would disparage those rights which  were not placed in that enumeration; and it might  follow by implication, that those rights which were  not singled out, were intended to be assigned into  the hands of the General Government, and were consequently  insecure. This is one of the most plausible  arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission  of a bill of rights into this system; but, I  conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have  attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 490]\n\u00a0\n  last clause of the fourth resolution [the Ninth  Amendment].\" I Annals of Congress 439 (Gales  and Seaton ed. 1834).\n\n\n Mr. Justice Story wrote of this argument against a bill of rights and the meaning of the Ninth Amendment:\n\n  \"In regard to . . . [a] suggestion, that the affirmance  of certain rights might disparage others, or  might lead to argumentative implications in favor of  other powers, it might be sufficient to say that such  a course of reasoning could never be sustained upon  any solid basis . . . . But a conclusive answer is,  that such an attempt may be interdicted (as it has  been) by a positive declaration in such a bill of rights  that the enumeration of certain rights shall not be  construed to deny or disparage others retained by the  people.\" II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution  of the United States 626-627 (5th ed. 1891).\n\n\n He further stated, referring to the Ninth Amendment:\n\n\"This clause was manifestly introduced to prevent any perverse or ingenious misapplication of the well-known maxim, that an affirmation in particular cases implies a negation in all others; and, e converso, that a negation in particular cases implies an affirmation in all others.\" Id., at 651.\n\n\n These statements of Madison and Story make clear that the Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights which the Constitution guaranteed to the people.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWhile this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment,\n6\n \"[i]t cannot be presumed that any \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 174. In interpreting the Constitution, \"real effect should be given to all the words it uses.\" Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 151\n. The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution may be regarded by some as a recent discovery and may be forgotten by others, but since 1791 it has been a basic part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold. To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever. Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment, which specifically states that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 492]\n\u00a0\n \"[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nA dissenting opinion suggests that my interpretation of the Ninth Amendment somehow \"broaden[s] the powers of this Court.\" Post, at 520. With all due respect, I believe that it misses the import of what I am saying. I do not take the position of my Brother BLACK in his dissent in Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 68\n, that the entire Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, and I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth. Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government. Rather, the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive. As any student of this Court's opinions knows, this Court has held, often unanimously, that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain fundamental personal liberties from abridgment by the Federal Government or the States. See, e. g., Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 \nU.S. 497\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, \n376 \nU.S. 254\n. The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Constitution's authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments. I do not see how this broadens the authority \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 493]\n\u00a0\n of the Court; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing in protecting fundamental rights.\n\nNor am I turning somersaults with history in arguing that the Ninth Amendment is relevant in a case dealing with a State's infringement of a fundamental right. While the Ninth Amendment - and indeed the entire Bill of Rights - originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the \"liberty\" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments. Cf. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75, 94\n-95.\n\nIn determining which rights are fundamental, judges are not left at large to decide cases in light of their personal and private notions. Rather, they must look to the \"traditions and [collective] conscience of our people\" to determine whether a principle is \"so rooted [there] . . . as to be ranked as fundamental.\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 105\n. The inquiry is whether a right involved \"is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those `fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' . . . .\" Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 67\n. \"Liberty\" also \"gains content from the emanations of . . . specific [constitutional] guarantees\" and \"from experience with the requirements of a free society.\" Poe \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 494]\n\u00a0\n v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 517\n (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS).\n7\n\u00a0\n\nI agree fully with the Court that, applying these tests, the right of privacy is a fundamental personal right, emanating \"from the totality of the constitutional scheme under which we live.\" Id., at 521. Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438, 478\n, comprehensively summarized the principles underlying the Constitution's guarantees of privacy:\n\n  \"The protection guaranteed by the [Fourth and  Fifth] Amendments is much broader in scope. The  makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions  favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They  recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature,  of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that  only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of  life are to be found in material things. They sought  to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,  their emotions and their sensations. They conferred,  as against the Government, the right to be let alone -  the most comprehensive of rights and the right most  valued by civilized men.\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Connecticut statutes here involved deal with a particularly important and sensitive area of privacy - that of the marital relation and the marital home. This Court recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, that the right \"to marry, establish a home and bring up children\" was an essential part of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n262 \nU.S., at 399\n. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, the Court held unconstitutional an Oregon Act which forbade parents from sending their children to private schools because such an act \"unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\" \n268 \nU.S., at 534\n-535. As this Court said in Prince v. Massachusetts, \n321 \nU.S. 158\n, at 166, the Meyer and Pierce decisions \"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\"\n\nI agree with MR. JUSTICE HARLAN's statement in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 551\n-552: \"Certainly the safeguarding of the home does not follow merely from the sanctity of property rights. The home derives its pre-eminence as the seat of family life. And the integrity of that life is something so fundamental that it has been found to draw to its protection the principles of more than one explicitly granted Constitutional right. . . . Of this whole `private realm of family life' it is difficult to imagine what is more private or more intimate than a husband and wife's marital relations.\"\n\nThe entire fabric of the Constitution and the purposes that clearly underlie its specific guarantees demonstrate that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected.\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not speak in so many words of the right of privacy in marriage, I cannot believe that it offers these fundamental rights no protection. The fact that no particular provision of the Constitution \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 496]\n\u00a0\n explicitly forbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the family - a relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization - surely does not show that the Government was meant to have the power to do so. Rather, as the Ninth Amendment expressly recognizes, there are fundamental personal rights such as this one, which are protected from abridgment by the Government though not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nMy Brother STEWART, while characterizing the Connecticut birth control law as \"an uncommonly silly law,\" post, at 527, would nevertheless let it stand on the ground that it is not for the courts to \"`substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.'\" Post, at 528. Elsewhere, I have stated that \"[w]hile I quite agree with Mr. Justice Brandeis that . . . `a . . . State may . . . serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments,' New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262, 280\n, 311 (dissenting opinion), I do not believe that this includes the power to experiment with the fundamental liberties of citizens . . . .\"\n8\n The vice of the dissenters' views is that it would permit such experimentation by the States in the area of the fundamental personal rights of its citizens. I cannot agree that the Constitution grants such power either to the States or to the Federal Government.\n\nThe logic of the dissents would sanction federal or state legislation that seems to me even more plainly unconstitutional than the statute before us. Surely the Government, absent a showing of a compelling subordinating state interest, could not decree that all husbands and wives must be sterilized after two children have been born \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 497]\n\u00a0\n to them. Yet by their reasoning such an invasion of marital privacy would not be subject to constitutional challenge because, while it might be \"silly,\" no provision of the Constitution specifically prevents the Government from curtailing the marital right to bear children and raise a family. While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy, in my view it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size, which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts. Yet, if upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality, a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid, then, by the same reasoning, a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid. In my view, however, both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected.\n\nIn a long series of cases this Court has held that where fundamental personal liberties are involved, they may not be abridged by the States simply on a showing that a regulatory statute has some rational relationship to the effectuation of a proper state purpose. \"Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling,\" Bates v. Little Rock, \n361 \nU.S. 516, 524\n. The law must be shown \"necessary, and not merely rationally related, to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy.\" McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184, 196\n. See Schneider v. Irvington, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n.\n\nAlthough the Connecticut birth-control law obviously encroaches upon a fundamental personal liberty, the State does not show that the law serves any \"subordinating [state] interest which is compelling\" or that it is \"necessary \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 498]\n\u00a0\n . . . to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy.\" The State, at most, argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concern - the discouraging of extra-marital relations. It says that preventing the use of birth-control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extramarital relations. The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut, unmarried as well as married, of birth-control devices for the prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception, see Tileston v. Ullman, 129 Conn. 84, 26 A. 2d 582. But, in any event, it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute, which does not, like the present one, sweep unnecessarily broadly, reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples. See Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500, 514\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n377 \nU.S. 288, 307\n-308; McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 196. Here, as elsewhere, where, \"[p]recision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.\" NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 438\n. The State of Connecticut does have statutes, the constitutionality of which is beyond doubt, which prohibit adultery and fornication. See Conn. Gen. Stat. 53-218, 53-219 et seq. These statutes demonstrate that means for achieving the same basic purpose of protecting marital fidelity are available to Connecticut without the need to \"invade the area of protected freedoms.\" NAACP v. Alabama, supra, at 307. See McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 196.\n\nFinally, it should be said of the Court's holding today that it in no way interferes with a State's proper regulation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 499]\n\u00a0\n of sexual promiscuity or misconduct. As my Brother HARLAN so well stated in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, supra, at 553.\n\n \"Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids . . . but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected. It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extra-marital sexuality . . . or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy.\"\n\n\n In sum, I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic - a personal right \"retained by the people\" within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment. Connecticut cannot constitutionally abridge this fundamental right, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States. I agree with the Court that petitioners' convictions must therefore be reversed.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] My Brother STEWART dissents on the ground that he \"can find no . . . general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court.\" Post, at 530. He would require a more explicit guarantee than the one which the Court derives from several constitutional amendments. This Court, however, has never held that the Bill of Rights or the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment protects only those rights that the Constitution specifically mentions by name. See, e. g., Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 \nU.S. 497\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n; Carrington v. Rash, \n380 \nU.S. 89, 96\n; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n360 \nU.S. 240\n; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n; Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n. To the contrary, this Court, for example, in Bolling v. Sharpe, supra, while recognizing that the Fifth Amendment does not contain the \"explicit safeguard\" of an equal protection clause, id., at 499, nevertheless derived an equal protection principle from that Amendment's Due Process Clause. And in Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, supra, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects from arbitrary state action the right to pursue an occupation, such as the practice of law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226\n; Gitlow v. New York, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n; Robinson v. California, \n370 \nU.S. 660\n; Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n; Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n; Pointer v. Texas, supra; Griffin v. California, \n380 \nU.S. 609\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Madison himself had previously pointed out the dangers of inaccuracy resulting from the fact that \"no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea.\" The Federalist, No. 37 (Cooke ed. 1961), at 236.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Alexander Hamilton was opposed to a bill of rights on the ground that it was unnecessary because the Federal Government was a government of delegated powers and it was not granted the power to intrude upon fundamental personal rights. The Federalist, No. 84 (Cooke ed. 1961), at 578-579. He also argued,\n\n\"I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\" Id., at 579.\n\n\n The Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment, which provides, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,\" were apparently also designed in part to meet the above-quoted argument of Hamilton.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Tenth Amendment similarly made clear that the States and the people retained all those powers not expressly delegated to the Federal Government.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This Amendment has been referred to as \"The Forgotten Ninth Amendment,\" in a book with that title by Bennett B. Patterson (1955). Other commentary on the Ninth Amendment includes Redlich, Are \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n There \"Certain Rights . . . Retained by the People\"? 37 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 787 (1962), and Kelsey, The Ninth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, 11 Ind. L. J. 309 (1936). As far as I am aware, until today this Court has referred to the Ninth Amendment only in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75, 94\n-95; Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA, \n306 \nU.S. 118, 143\n-144; and Ashwander v. TVA, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 330\n-331. See also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388; Loan Assn. v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, 662-663.\n\nIn United Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra, at 94-95, the Court stated: \"We accept appellants' contention that the nature of political rights reserved to the people by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments [is] involved. The right claimed as inviolate may be stated as the right of a citizen to act as a party official or worker to further his own political views. Thus we have a measure of interference by the Hatch Act and the Rules with what otherwise would be the freedom of the civil servant under the First, Ninth and Tenth Amendments. And, if we look upon due process as a guarantee of freedom in those fields, there is a corresponding impairment of that right under the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In light of the tests enunciated in these cases it cannot be said that a judge's responsibility to determine whether a right is basic and fundamental in this sense vests him with unrestricted personal discretion. In fact, a hesitancy to allow too broad a discretion was a substantial reason leading me to conclude in Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 413-414, that those rights absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to the States because they are fundamental apply with equal force and to the same extent against both federal and state governments. In Pointer I said that the contrary view would require \"this Court to make the extremely subjective and excessively discretionary determination as to whether a practice, forbidden the Federal Government by a fundamental constitutional guarantee, is, as viewed in the factual circumstances surrounding each individual case, sufficiently repugnant to the notion of due process as to be forbidden the States.\" Id., at 413.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 413. See also the discussion of my Brother DOUGLAS. Poe v. Ullman, supra, at 517-518 (dissenting opinion).\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the judgment.\n\nI fully agree with the judgment of reversal, but find myself unable to join the Court's opinion. The reason is that it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers BLACK and STEWART in dissent, namely: the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn other words, what I find implicit in the Court's opinion is that the \"incorporation\" doctrine may be used to restrict the reach of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process. For me this is just as unacceptable constitutional doctrine as is the use of the \"incorporation\" approach to impose upon the States all the requirements of the Bill of Rights as found in the provisions of the first eight amendments and in the decisions of this Court interpreting them. See, e. g., my concurring opinions in Pointer v. Texas, \n380 \nU.S. 400, 408\n, and Griffin v. California, \n380 \nU.S. 609, 615\n, and my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 522\n, at pp. 539-545.\n\nIn my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n. For reasons stated at length in my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, supra, I believe that it does. While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands, in my opinion, on its own bottom.\n\nA further observation seems in order respecting the justification of my Brothers BLACK and STEWART for their \"incorporation\" approach to this case. Their approach does not rest on historical reasons, which are of course wholly lacking (see Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949)), but on the thesis that by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution, in this instance in the Bill of Rights, judges will thus be confined to \"interpretation\" of specific constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 501]\n\u00a0\n provisions, and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the \"vague contours of the Due Process Clause.\" Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 170\n.\n\nWhile I could not more heartily agree that judicial \"self restraint\" is an indispensable ingredient of sound constitutional adjudication, I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real. \"Specific\" provisions of the Constitution, no less than \"due process,\" lend themselves as readily to \"personal\" interpretations by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed \"tune with the times\" (post, p. 522). Need one go further than to recall last Term's reapportionment cases, Wesberry v. Sanders, \n376 \nU.S. 1\n. and Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, where a majority of the Court \"interpreted\" \"by the People\" (Art. I, 2) and \"equal protection\" (Amdt. 14) to command \"one person, one vote,\" an interpretation that was made in the face of irrefutable and still unanswered history to the contrary? See my dissenting opinions in those cases, \n376 \nU.S., at 20\n; \n377 \nU.S., at 589\n.\n\nJudicial self-restraint will not, I suggest, be brought about in the \"due process\" area by the historically unfounded incorporation formula long advanced by my Brother BLACK, and now in part espoused by my Brother STEWART. It will be achieved in this area, as in other constitutional areas, only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms. See Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 59\n (Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring). Adherence to these principles will not, of course, obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges, nor should it. Their continued recognition \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 502]\n\u00a0\n will, however, go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Indeed, my Brother BLACK, in arguing his thesis, is forced to lay aside a host of cases in which the Court has recognized fundamental rights in the Fourteenth Amendment without specific reliance upon the Bill of Rights. Post, p. 512, n. 4.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.\n\nIn my view this Connecticut law as applied to married couples deprives them of \"liberty\" without due process of law, as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court reversing these convictions under Connecticut's aiding and abetting statute.\n\nIt would be unduly repetitious, and belaboring the obvious, to expound on the impact of this statute on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary or capricious denials or on the nature of this liberty. Suffice it to say that this is not the first time this Court has had occasion to articulate that the liberty entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right \"to marry, establish a home and bring up children,\" Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390, 399\n, and \"the liberty . . . to direct the upbringing and education of children,\" Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510, 534\n-535, and that these are among \"the basic civil rights of man.\" Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535, 541\n. These decisions affirm that there is a \"realm of family life which the state cannot enter\" without substantial justification. Prince v. Massachusetts, \n321 \nU.S. 158, 166\n. Surely the right invoked in this case, to be free of regulation of the intimacies of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 503]\n\u00a0\n the marriage relationship, \"come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.\" Kovacs v. Cooper, \n336 \nU.S. 77, 95\n (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).\n\nThe Connecticut anti-contraceptive statute deals rather substantially with this relationship. For it forbids all married persons the right to use birth-control devices, regardless of whether their use is dictated by considerations of family planning, Trubek v. Ullman, 147 Conn. 633, 165 A. 2d 158, health, or indeed even of life itself. Buxton v. Ullman, 147 Conn. 48, 156 A. 2d 508. The anti-use statute, together with the general aiding and abetting statute, prohibits doctors from affording advice to married persons on proper and effective methods of birth control. Tileston v. Ullman, 129 Conn. 84, 26 A. 2d 582. And the clear effect of these statutes, as enforced, is to deny disadvantaged citizens of Connecticut, those without either adequate knowledge or resources to obtain private counseling, access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control. State v. Nelson, 126 Conn. 412, 11 A. 2d 856; State v. Griswold, 151 Conn. 544, 200 A. 2d 479. In my view, a statute with these effects bears a substantial burden of justification when attacked under the Fourteenth Amendment. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n; Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535\n; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n; McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184, 192\n.\n\nAn examination of the justification offered, however, cannot be avoided by saying that the Connecticut anti-use statute invades a protected area of privacy and association or that it demeans the marriage relationship. The nature of the right invaded is pertinent, to be sure, for statutes regulating sensitive areas of liberty do, under \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 504]\n\u00a0\n the cases of this Court, require \"strict scrutiny,\" Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535, 541\n, and \"must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.\" Shelton v. Tucker, \n364 \nU.S. 479, 488\n. \"Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling.\" Bates v. Little Rock, \n361 \nU.S. 516, 524\n. See also McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184\n. But such statutes, if reasonably necessary for the effectuation of a legitimate and substantial state interest, and not arbitrary or capricious in application, are not invalid under the Due Process Clause. Zemel v. Rusk, \n381 \nU.S. 1\n.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 505]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs I read the opinions of the Connecticut courts and the argument of Connecticut in this Court, the State claims but one justification for its anti-use statute. Cf. Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, \n358 \nU.S. 522, 530\n; Martin v. Walton, \n368 \nU.S. 25, 28\n (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting). There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself, or that the anti-use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion. Rather, the statute is said to serve the State's policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships, be they premarital or extramarital, concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal.\n\nWithout taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct, I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State's ban on illicit sexual relationships. See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232, 239\n. Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices; they are not considered contraband material under state law, State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials, 126 Conn. 428, 11 A. 2d 863, and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed. The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute whose operation in this context has \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 506]\n\u00a0\n been quite obviously ineffective and whose most serious use has been against birth-control clinics rendering advice to married, rather than unmarried, persons. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n. Indeed, after over 80 years of the State's proscription of use, the legality of the sale of such devices to prevent disease has never been expressly passed upon, although it appears that sales have long occurred and have only infrequently been challenged. This \"undeviating policy . . . throughout all the long years . . . bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis.\" Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 502\n. Moreover, it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law.\n\nIn these circumstances one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations and thereby contributes to the State's policy against such relationships. Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation. It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration. Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship, there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones. This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship, notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility, but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti-use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships, a premise whose validity has not been \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 507]\n\u00a0\n demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident. At most the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective. A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way, and with the same effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, as the broad anti-use statute under attack in this case. I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute, with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons, and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Dissenting opinions assert that the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause is limited to a guarantee against unduly vague statutes and against procedural unfairness at trial. Under this view the Court is without authority to ascertain whether a challenged statute, or its application, has a permissible purpose and whether the manner of regulation bears a rational or justifying relationship to this purpose. A long line of cases makes very clear that this has not been the view of this Court. Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n; Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165\n; Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n; Zemel v. Rusk, \n381 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nThe traditional due process test was well articulated, and applied, in Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, supra, a case which placed no reliance on the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\n\n\"A State cannot exclude a person from the practice of law or from any other occupation in a manner or for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n. Cf. Slochower v. Board of Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n; Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n. And see Ex parte Secombe, 19 How. 9, 13. A State can require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar, but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant's fitness or capacity to practice law. Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165\n; Cummings \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 505]\n\u00a0\n v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 319-320. Cf. Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n. Obviously an applicant could not be excluded merely because he was a Republican or a Negro or a member of a particular church. Even in applying permissible standards, officers of a State cannot exclude an applicant when there is no basis for their finding that he fails to meet these standards, or when their action is invidiously discriminatory.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 238\n-239. Cf. Martin v. Walton, \n368 \nU.S. 25, 26\n (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nI agree with my Brother STEWART'S dissenting opinion. And like him I do not to any extent whatever base my view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise or that its policy is a good one. In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do, I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG who, reciting reasons why it is offensive to them, hold it unconstitutional. There is no single one of the graphic and eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court's opinion or by those of my concurring Brethren to which I cannot subscribe - except their conclusion that the evil qualities they see in the law make it unconstitutional.\n\nHad the doctor defendant here, or even the nondoctor defendant, been convicted for doing nothing more than expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices, medicines or practices would do them good and would be desirable, or for telling people how devices could be used, I can think of no reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 508]\n\u00a0\n protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantee freedom of speech. Cf. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, \n377 \nU.S. 1\n; NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415\n. But speech is one thing; conduct and physical activities are quite another. See, e. g., Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 554\n-555; Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 559, 563\n-564; id., 575-584 (concurring opinion); Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n; cf. Reynolds v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 145, 163\n-164. The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women, advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them, and then supplied the devices themselves, all for a graduated scale of fees, based on the family income. Thus these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law. Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conduct - just as in ordinary life some speech accompanies most kinds of conduct - we are not in my view justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct. Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law. What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is, as I have said, quite another matter.\n\nThe Court talks about a constitutional \"right of privacy\" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the \"privacy\" of individuals. But there is not. There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities. Such, for example, is the Fourth \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 509]\n\u00a0\n Amendment's guarantee against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but \"privacy.\" To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given. The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth. He simply wants his property left alone. And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.\n\nOne of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning. This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term \"right of privacy\" as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" \"Privacy\" is a broad, abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also, on the other hand, easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures. I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used. See e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, \n376 \nU.S. 254, 293\n (concurring opinion); cases collected in City of El Paso v. Simmons, \n379 \nU.S. 497, 517\n, n. 1 (dissenting opinion); Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 865. For these reasons I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional \"right of privacy\" as an emanation from \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 510]\n\u00a0\n one or more constitutional provisions.\n1\n I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision. For these reasons I cannot agree with the Court's judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional.\n\nThis brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG for invalidating the Connecticut law. Brothers HARLAN\n2\n and WHITE would invalidate it by reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but Brother GOLDBERG, while agreeing with Brother HARLAN, relies also on the Ninth Amendment. I have no doubt that the Connecticut law could be applied in such a way as to abridge freedom of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 511]\n\u00a0\n speech and press and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. My disagreement with the Court's opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one, relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case. But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic. I think that if properly construed neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment, nor both together, could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law. I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because on analysis they turn out to be the same thing - merely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational, unreasonable or offensive.\n\nThe due process argument which my Brothers HARLAN and WHITE adopt here is based, as their opinions indicate, on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or oppressive, or on this Court's belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has no \"rational or justifying\" purpose, or is offensive to a \"sense of fairness and justice.\"\n3\n If these formulas based on \"natural justice,\" or others which mean the same thing,\n4\n are to prevail, they require judges to determine \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 512]\n\u00a0\n what is or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary. The power to make such decisions is of course that of a legislative body. Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous. I readily admit that no legislative body, state or national, should pass laws that can justly be given any \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 513]\n\u00a0\n of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws. But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane, rational, wise and justifiable purpose. While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, and subsequent cases, that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes, state or federal, that violate commands of the Federal Constitution, I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or accomplishes no justifiable purpose, or is offensive to our own notions of \"civilized standards of conduct.\"\n5\n Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws, not of the power to interpret them. The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination - a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf the cases on which my Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG rely so heavily, undoubtedly the reasoning of two of them supports their result here - as would that of a number of others which they do not bother to name, e. g., \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 515]\n\u00a0\n Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45\n, Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 \nU.S. 504\n, and Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n. The two they do cite and quote from, Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in Lochner v. New York, supra, one of the cases on which he relied in Meyer, along with such other long-discredited decisions as, e. g., Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590\n, and Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra. Meyer held unconstitutional, as an \"arbitrary\" and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him, a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 516]\n\u00a0\n state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools.\n7\n And in Pierce, relying principally on Meyer, Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an \"arbitrary, unreasonable and unlawful interference\" which threatened \"destruction of their business and property.\" \n268 \nU.S., at 536\n. Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the State through the Fourteenth,\n8\n I merely point out that the reasoning stated in Meyer and Pierce was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated, and which I cannot accept. Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG also cite other cases, such as NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415\n, Shelton v. Tucker, \n364 \nU.S. 479\n, and Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, which held that States in regulating conduct could not, consistently with the First Amendment as applied to them by the Fourteenth, pass unnecessarily broad laws which might indirectly infringe on First Amendment freedoms.\n9\n See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 517]\n\u00a0\n Virginia State Bar, \n377 \nU.S. 1, 7\n-8.\n10\n Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG now apparently would start from this requirement that laws be narrowly drafted so as not to curtail free speech and assembly, and extend it limitlessly to require States to justify any law restricting \"liberty\" as my Brethren define \"liberty.\" This would mean at the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 518]\n\u00a0\n very least, I suppose, that every state criminal statute - since it must inevitably curtail \"liberty\" to some extent - would be suspect, and would have to be justified to this Court.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nMy Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery\n12\n that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 519]\n\u00a0\n violates \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice,\" or is contrary to the \"traditions and [collective] conscience of our people.\" He also states, without proof satisfactory to me, that in making decisions on this basis judges will not consider \"their personal and private notions.\" One may ask how they can avoid considering them. Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll.\n13\n And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the \"[collective] conscience of our people.\" Moreover, one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment\n14\n to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress. Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine. The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way, and the very material quoted by my Bother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that \"by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power\" to the Federal Government, \"those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [the United States], and were consequently \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 520]\n\u00a0\n insecure.\"\n15\n That Amendment was passed, not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of \"the General Government,\" but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication. If any broad, unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the \"[collective] conscience of our people\" is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the Constitution, it was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court. This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that for a period of a century and a half no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment, enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion, could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs. Use of any such broad, unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court's members a day-to-day constitutional convention.\n\nI repeat so as not to be misunderstood that this Court does have power, which it should exercise, to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution. My point is that there is no provision \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 521]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational. The adoption of such a loose, flexible, uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional, if ever it is finally achieved, will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts and worse for the country. Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would, I fear, jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up and at the same time threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 522]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must with all deference reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and being somewhat old-fashioned I must add it is good enough for me. And so, I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law. The Due Process Clause with an \"arbitrary and capricious\" or \"shocking to the conscience\" formula was liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century, threatening, many people thought, the tranquility and stability of the Nation. See, e. g., Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45\n. That formula, based on subjective considerations of \"natural justice,\" is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court's views about personal rights than those about economic rights. I had thought that we had laid that formula, as a means for striking down state legislation, to rest once and for all in cases like West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n; Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., \n313 \nU.S. 236\n, and many other \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 523]\n\u00a0\n opinions.\n17\n See also Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45, 74\n (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n\nIn Ferguson v. Skrupa, \n372 \nU.S. 726, 730\n, this Court two years ago said in an opinion joined by all the Justices but one\n18\n that\n\n \"The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases - that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely - has long since been discarded. We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\"\n\n\n And only six weeks ago, without even bothering to hear argument, this Court overruled Tyson & Brother v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, which had held state laws regulating ticket brokers to be a denial of due process of law.\n19\n Gold \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 524]\n\u00a0\n v. DiCarlo, \n380 \nU.S. 520\n. I find April's holding hard to square with what my concurring Brethren urge today. They would reinstate the Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns line of cases, cases from which this Court recoiled after the 1930's, and which had been I thought totally discredited until now. Apparently my Brethren have less quarrel with state economic regulations than former Justices of their persuasion had. But any limitation upon their using the natural law due process philosophy to strike down any state law, dealing with any activity whatever, will obviously be only self-imposed.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1798, when this Court was asked to hold another Connecticut law unconstitutional, Justice Iredell said:\n\n\"[I]t has been the policy of all the American states, which have, individually, framed their state constitutions since the revolution, and of the people of the United States, when they framed the Federal Constitution, to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries. If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void; though, I admit, that as the authority to declare it void is of a delicate and awful nature, the Court will never resort to that authority, but in a clear and urgent case. If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 525]\n\u00a0\n general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice. The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice.\" Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n I would adhere to that constitutional philosophy in passing on this Connecticut law today. I am not persuaded to deviate from the view which I stated in 1947 in Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 90\n-92 (dissenting opinion):\n\n \"Since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, was decided, the practice has been firmly established, for better or worse, that courts can strike down legislative enactments which violate the Constitution. This process, of course, involves interpretation, and since words can have many meanings, interpretation obviously may result in contraction or extension of the original purpose of a constitutional provision, thereby affecting policy. But to pass upon the constitutionality of statutes by looking to the particular standards enumerated in the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution is one thing; to invalidate statutes because of application of `natural law' deemed to be above and undefined by the Constitution is another. `In the one instance, courts proceeding within clearly marked constitutional boundaries seek to execute policies written into the Constitution; in the other, they roam at will in the limitless \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 526]\n\u00a0\n area of their own beliefs as to reasonableness and actually select policies, a responsibility which the Constitution entrusts to the legislative representatives of the people.' Federal Power Commission v. Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575, 599\n, 601, n. 4.\"\n21\n (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n The late Judge Learned Hand, after emphasizing his view that judges should not use the due process formula suggested in the concurring opinions today or any other formula like it to invalidate legislation offensive to their \"personal preferences,\"\n22\n made the statement, with which I fully agree, that:\n\n\"For myself it would be most irksome to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians, even if I \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 527]\n\u00a0\n knew how to choose them, which I assuredly do not.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n So far as I am concerned, Connecticut's law as applied here is not forbidden by any provision of the Federal Constitution as that Constitution was written, and I would therefore affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The phrase \"right to privacy\" appears first to have gained currency from an article written by Messrs. Warren and (later Mr. Justice) Brandeis in 1890 which urged that States should give some form of tort relief to persons whose private affairs were exploited by others. The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193. Largely as a result of this article, some States have passed statutes creating such a cause of action, and in others state courts have done the same thing by exercising their powers as courts of common law. See generally 41 Am. Jur. 926-927. Thus the Supreme Court of Georgia, in granting a cause of action for damages to a man whose picture had been used in a newspaper advertisement without his consent, said that \"A right of privacy in matters purely private is . . . derived from natural law\" and that \"The conclusion reached by us seems to be . . . thoroughly in accord with natural justice, with the principles of the law of every civilized nation, and especially with the elastic principles of the common law. . . .\" Pavesich v. New England Life Ins. Co., 122 Ga. 190, 194, 218, 50 S. E. 68, 70, 80. Observing that \"the right of privacy . . . presses for recognition here,\" today this Court, which I did not understand to have power to sit as a court of common law, now appears to be exalting a phrase which Warren and Brandeis used in discussing grounds for tort relief, to the level of a constitutional rule which prevents state legislatures from passing any law deemed by this Court to interfere with \"privacy.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Brother HARLAN'S views are spelled out at greater length in his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 539\n-555.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Indeed, Brother WHITE appears to have gone beyond past pronouncements of the natural law due process theory, which at least said that the Court should exercise this unlimited power to declare state acts unconstitutional with \"restraint.\" He now says that, instead of being presumed constitutional (see Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113, 123\n; compare Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 544\n), the statute here \"bears a substantial burden of justification when attacked under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A collection of the catchwords and catch phrases invoked by judges who would strike down under the Fourteenth Amendment laws which offend their notions of natural justice would fill many pages. Thus it has been said that this Court can forbid state action \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 512]\n\u00a0\n which \"shocks the conscience,\" Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, sufficiently to \"shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution,\" Irvine v. California, \n347 \nU.S. 128, 138\n (concurring opinion). It has been urged that States may not run counter to the \"decencies of civilized conduct,\" Rochin, supra, at 173, or \"some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 105\n, or to \"those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples,\" Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401, 417\n (concurring opinion), or to \"the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" Rochin, supra, at 173. It has been said that we must decide whether a state law is \"fair, reasonable and appropriate,\" or is rather \"an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty or to enter into . . . contracts,\" Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45, 56\n. States, under this philosophy, cannot act in conflict with \"deeply rooted feelings of the community,\" Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596, 604\n (separate opinion), or with \"fundamental notions of fairness and justice,\" id., 607. See also, e. g., Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25, 27\n (\"rights . . . basic to our free society\"); Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n (\"fundamental principles of liberty and justice\"); Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 561\n (\"arbitrary restraint of . . . liberties\"); Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455, 462\n (\"denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice\"); Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 539\n (dissenting opinion) (\"intolerable and unjustifiable\"). Perhaps the clearest, frankest and briefest explanation of how this due process approach works is the statement in another case handed down today that this Court is to invoke the Due Process Clause to strike down state procedures or laws which it can \"not tolerate.\" Linkletter v. Walker, post, p. 618, at 631.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Hand, The Bill of Rights (1958) 70:\n\n\"[J]udges are seldom content merely to annul the particular solution before them; they do not, indeed they may not, say that taking all things into consideration, the legislators' solution is too strong for the judicial stomach. On the contrary they wrap up their veto in a protective veil of adjectives such as `arbitrary,' `artificial,' `normal,' `reasonable,' `inherent,' `fundamental,' or `essential,' whose office usually, though quite innocently, is to disguise what they are doing and impute to it a derivation far more impressive than their personal preferences, which are all that in fact lie behind the decision.\" See also Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 174\n (concurring opinion). But see Linkletter v. Walker, supra, n. 4, at 631.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This Court held in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, that this Court has power to invalidate laws on the ground that they exceed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 514]\n\u00a0\n the constitutional power of Congress or violate some specific prohibition of the Constitution. See also Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87. But the Constitutional Convention did on at least two occasions reject proposals which would have given the federal judiciary a part in recommending laws or in vetoing as bad or unwise the legislation passed by the Congress. Edmund Randolph of Virginia proposed that the President\n\n\". . . and a convenient number of the National Judiciary, ought to compose a council of revision with authority to examine every act of the National Legislature before it shall operate, & every act of a particular Legislature before a Negative thereon shall be final; and that the dissent of the said Council shall amount to a rejection, unless the Act of the National Legislature be again passed, or that of a particular Legislature be again negatived by [original wording illegible] of the members of each branch.\" 1 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (Farrand ed. 1911) 21.\n\n\n In support of a plan of this kind James Wilson of Pennsylvania argued that:\n\n\". . . It had been said that the Judges, as expositors of the Laws would have an opportunity of defending their constitutional rights. There was weight in this observation; but this power of the Judges did not go far enough. Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect. Let them have a share in the Revisionary power, and they will have an opportunity of taking notice of these characters of a law, and of counteracting, by the weight of their opinions the improper views of the Legislature.\" 2 id., at 73.\n\n\n Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts \"did not see the advantage of employing the Judges in this way. As Judges they are not to be presumed to possess any peculiar knowledge of the mere policy of public measures.\" Ibid.\n\nElbridge Gerry of Massachusetts likewise opposed the proposal for a council of revision:\n\n\". . . He relied for his part on the Representatives of the people as the guardians of their Rights & interests. It [the proposal] was \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 515]\n\u00a0\n making the Expositors of the Laws, the Legislators which ought never to be done.\" Id., at 75.\n\n\n And at another point:\n\n\"Mr. Gerry doubts whether the Judiciary ought to form a part of it [the proposed council of revision], as they will have a sufficient check agst. encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a power of deciding on their Constitutionality. . . . It was quite foreign from the nature of ye. office to make them judges of the policy of public measures.\" 1 Id., at 97-98.\n\n\n Madison supported the proposal on the ground that \"a Check [on the legislature] is necessary.\" Id., at 108. John Dickinson of Delaware opposed it on the ground that \"the Judges must interpret the Laws they ought not to be legislators.\" Ibid. The proposal for a council of revision was defeated.\n\n The following proposal was also advanced:\n\n\"To assist the President in conducting the Public affairs there shall be a Council of State composed of the following officers - 1. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall from time to time recommend such alterations of and additions to the laws of the U.S. as may in his opinion be necessary to the due administration of Justice, and such as may promote useful learning and inculcate sound morality throughout the Union. . . .\" 2 id., at 342. This proposal too was rejected.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Meyer, in the very same sentence quoted in part by my Brethren in which he asserted that the Due Process Clause gave an abstract and inviolable right \"to marry, establish a home and bring up children,\" Mr. Justice McReynolds also asserted the heretofore discredited doctrine that the Due Process Clause prevented States from interfering with \"the right of the individual to contract.\" \n262 \nU.S., at 399\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Compare Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S., at 543\n-544 (HARLAN, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Court has also said that in view of the Fourteenth Amendment's major purpose of eliminating state-enforced racial discrimination, this Court will scrutinize carefully any law embodying a racial classification to make sure that it does not deny equal protection of the laws. See McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] None of the other cases decided in the past 25 years which Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG cite can justly be read as holding that judges have power to use a natural law due process formula to strike down all state laws which they think are unwise, dangerous, or irrational. Prince v. Massachusetts, \n321 \nU.S. 158\n, upheld a state law forbidding minors from selling publications on the streets. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n, recognized the power of Congress to restrict travel outside the country so long as it accorded persons the procedural safeguards of due process and did not violate any other specific constitutional provision. Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n, held simply that a State could not, consistently with due process, refuse a lawyer a license to practice law on the basis of a finding that he was morally unfit when there was no evidence in the record, \n353 \nU.S., at 246\n-247, to support such a finding. Compare Thompson v. City of Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n, in which the Court relied in part on Schware. See also Konigsberg v. State Bar, \n353 \nU.S. 252\n. And Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 \nU.S. 497\n, merely recognized what had been the understanding from the beginning of the country, an understanding shared by many of the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment, that the whole Bill of Rights, including the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, was a guarantee that all persons would receive equal treatment under the law. Compare Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 240\n-241. With one exception, the other modern cases relied on by my Brethren were decided either solely under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or under the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, some of the latter group involving the right of association which this Court has held to be a part of the rights of speech, press and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment. As for Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n, I am compelled to say that if that decision was written or intended to bring about the abrupt and drastic reversal in the course of constitutional adjudication which is now attributed to it, the change was certainly made in a very quiet and unprovocative manner, without any attempt to justify it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Compare Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 568\n (Holmes, J., dissenting):\n\n\"The earlier decisions upon the same words [the Due Process Clause] in the Fourteenth Amendment began within our memory and went no farther than an unpretentious assertion of the liberty to follow the ordinary callings. Later that innocuous generality was expanded into the dogma, Liberty of Contract. Contract is not specially mentioned in the text that we have to construe. It is merely an example of doing what you want to do, embodied in the word liberty. But pretty much all law consists in forbidding men to do some things that they want to do, and contract is no more exempt from law than other acts.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See Patterson, The Forgotten Ninth Amendment (1955). Mr. Patterson urges that the Ninth Amendment be used to protect unspecified \"natural and inalienable rights.\" P. 4. The Introduction by Roscoe Pound states that \"there is a marked revival of natural law ideas throughout the world. Interest in the Ninth Amendment is a symptom of that revival.\" P. iii.\n\nIn Redlich, Are There \"Certain Rights . . . Retained by the People\"?, 37 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 787, Professor Redlich, in advocating reliance on the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to invalidate the Connecticut law before us, frankly states:\n\n\"But for one who feels that the marriage relationship should be beyond the reach of a state law forbidding the use of contraceptives, the birth control case poses a troublesome and challenging problem of constitutional interpretation. He may find himself saying, `The law is unconstitutional - but why?' There are two possible paths to travel in finding the answer. One is to revert to a frankly flexible due process concept even on matters that do not involve specific constitutional prohibitions. The other is to attempt to evolve a new constitutional framework within which to meet this and similar problems which are likely to arise.\" Id., at 798.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Of course one cannot be oblivious to the fact that Mr. Gallup has already published the results of a poll which he says show that 46% of the people in this country believe schools should teach about birth control. Washington Post, May 21, 1965, p. 2, col. 1. I can hardly believe, however, that Brother GOLDBERG would view 46% of the persons polled as so overwhelming a proportion that this Court may now rely on it to declare that the Connecticut law infringes \"fundamental\" rights, and overrule the long-standing view of the people of Connecticut expressed through their elected representatives.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] U.S. Const., Amend. IX, provides:\n\n\"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] 1 Annals of Congress 439. See also II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (5th ed. 1891): \"This clause was manifestly introduced to prevent any perverse or ingenious misapplication of the well-known maxim, that an affirmation in particular cases implies a negation in all others; and, e converso, that a negation in particular cases implies an affirmation in all others. The maxim, rightly understood, is perfectly sound and safe; but it has often been strangely forced from its natural meaning into the support of the most dangerous political heresies.\" Id., at 651 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Justice Holmes in one of his last dissents, written in reply to Mr. Justice McReynolds' opinion for the Court in Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, solemnly warned against a due process formula apparently approved by my concurring Brethren today. He said:\n\n\"I have not yet adequately expressed the more than anxiety that I feel at the ever increasing scope given to the Fourteenth Amendment in cutting down what I believe to be the constitutional rights of the States. As the decisions now stand, I see hardly any limit but the sky to the invalidating of those rights if they happen to strike a majority of this Court as for any reason undesirable. I cannot believe that the Amendment was intended to give us carte blanche to embody our economic or moral beliefs in its prohibitions. Yet I can think of no narrower reason that seems to me to justify the present and the earlier decisions to which I have referred. Of course the words `due process of law,' if taken in their literal meaning, have no application to this case; and while it is too late to deny that they have been given a much more extended and artificial signification, still we ought to remember the great caution shown by the Constitution \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 522]\n\u00a0\n in limiting the power of the States, and should be slow to construe the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment as committing to the Court, with no guide but the Court's own discretion, the validity of whatever laws the State may pass.\" \n281 \nU.S., at 595\n. See 2 Holmes-Pollock Letters (Howe ed. 1941) 267-268.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] E. g., in Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, \n342 \nU.S. 421, 423\n, this Court held that \"Our recent decisions make plain that we do not sit as a superlegislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation nor to decide whether the policy which it expresses offends the public welfare.\"\n\nCompare Gardner v. Massachusetts, \n305 \nU.S. 559\n, which the Court today apparently overrules, which held that a challenge under the Federal Constitution to a state law forbidding the sale or furnishing of contraceptives did not raise a substantial federal question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Brother HARLAN, who has consistently stated his belief in the power of courts to strike down laws which they consider arbitrary or unreasonable, see, e. g., Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497, 539\n-555 (dissenting opinion), did not join the Court's opinion in Ferguson v. Skrupa.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Justice Holmes, dissenting in Tyson, said:\n\n\"I think the proper course is to recognize that a state legislature can do whatever it sees fit to do unless it is restrained by some express prohibition in the Constitution of the United States or of the State, and that Courts should be careful not to extend such prohibitions beyond their obvious meaning by reading into them conceptions of public policy that the particular Court may happen to entertain.\" \n273 \nU.S., at 446\n.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Compare Nicchia v. New York, \n254 \nU.S. 228, 231\n, upholding a New York dog-licensing statute on the ground that it did not \"deprive dog owners of liberty without due process of law.\" And as I said concurring in Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 175\n, \"I believe that faithful adherence to the specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights insures a more permanent protection of individual liberty than that which can be afforded by the nebulous standards\" urged by my concurring Brethren today.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n, and similar cases applying specific Bill of Rights provisions to the States do not in my view stand for the proposition that this Court can rely on its own concept of \"ordered liberty\" or \"shocking the conscience\" or natural law to decide what laws it will permit state legislatures to enact. Gideon in applying to state prosecutions the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of right to counsel followed Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, which had held that specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, rather than the Bill of Rights as a whole, would be selectively applied to the States. While expressing my own belief (not shared by MR. JUSTICE STEWART) that all the provisions of the Bill of Rights were made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, in my dissent in Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 89\n, I also said:\n\n\"If the choice must be between the selective process of the Palko decision applying some of the Bill of Rights to the States, or the Twining rule applying none of them, I would choose the Palko selective process.\"\n\n\n Gideon and similar cases merely followed the Palko rule, which in Adamson I agreed to follow if necessary to make Bill of Rights safeguards applicable to the States. See also Pointer v. Texas, \n380 \nU.S. 400\n; Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Hand, The Bill of Rights (1958) 70. See note 5, supra. See generally id., at 35-45.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Id., at 73. While Judge Hand condemned as unjustified the invalidation of state laws under the natural law due process formula, see id., at 35-45, he also expressed the view that this Court in a number of cases had gone too far in holding legislation to be in violation of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Although I agree with his criticism of use of the due process formula, I do not agree with all the views he expressed about construing the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I think this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do.\n\nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 528]\n\u00a0\n But the Court does not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law.\n\nWe are told that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not, as such, the \"guide\" in this case. With that much I agree. There is no claim that this law, duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature is unconstitutionally vague. There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial, so as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid. And, as the Court says, the day has long passed since the Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining \"the wisdom, need, and propriety\" of state laws. Compare Lochner v. New York, \n198 \nU.S. 45\n, with Ferguson v. Skrupa, \n372 \nU.S. 726\n. My Brothers HARLAN and WHITE to the contrary, \"[w]e have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws.\" Ferguson v. Skrupa, supra, at 730.\n\nAs to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States.\n1\n It has \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 529]\n\u00a0\n not even been argued that this is a law \"respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n2\n And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the level of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of \"the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n3\n No soldier has been quartered in any house.\n4\n There has been no search, and no seizure.\n5\n Nobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother GOLDBERG'S concurring opinion relies heavily upon it. But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held \"states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,\" United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 530]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States. Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annual a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.\n\nWhat provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of privacy \"created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.\" With all deference, I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nAt the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not \"conform to current community standards.\" But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards. We are here to decide cases \"agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" It is the essence of judicial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 479, 531]\n\u00a0\n duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the people of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Amendments in question were, as everyone knows, originally adopted as limitations upon the power of the newly created Federal Government, not as limitation upon the powers of the individual States. But the Court has held that many of the provisions of the first eight amendments are fully embraced by the Fourteenth Amendment as limitations upon state action, and some members of the Court have held the view that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment made every provision of the first eight amendments fully applicable against the States. See Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 68\n (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S. Constitution, Amendment I. To be sure, the injunction contained in the Connecticut statute coincides with the doctrine of certain religious faiths. But if that were enough to invalidate a law under the provisions of the First Amendment relating to religion, then most criminal laws would be invalidated. See, e. g., the Ten Commandments. The Bible, Exodus 20:2-17 (King James).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] U.S. Constitution, Amendment I. If all the appellants had done was to advise people that they thought the use of contraceptives was desirable, or even to counsel their use, the appellants would, of course, have a substantial First Amendment claim. But their activities went far beyond mere advocacy. They prescribed specific contraceptive devices and furnished patients with the prescribed contraceptive materials.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] U.S. Constitution, Amendment III.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] U.S. Constitution, Amendment IV.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] U.S. Constitution, Amendment V.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cases like Shelton v. Tucker, \n364 \nU.S. 479\n and Bates v. Little Rock, \n361 \nU.S. 516\n, relied upon in the concurring opinions today, dealt with true First Amendment rights of association and are wholly inapposite here. See also, e. g., NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; Edwards v. South Carolina, \n372 \nU.S. 229\n. Our decision in McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184\n, is equally far afield. That case held invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a state criminal law which discriminated against Negroes.\n\nThe Court does not say how far the new constitutional right of privacy announced today extends. See, e. g., Mueller, Legal Regulation of Sexual Conduct, at 127; Ploscowe, Sex and the Law, at 189. I suppose, however, that even after today a State can constitutionally still punish at least some offenses which are not committed in public.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533, 562\n. The Connecticut House of Representatives recently passed a bill (House Bill No. 2462) repealing the birth control law. The State Senate has apparently not yet acted on the measure, and today is relieved of that responsibility by the Court.

CO.(1965)\nNo. 27\nArgued: November 8, 1965Decided: December 8, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner after long employment as an engineer was removed from service following an adverse physical report by respondent railroad's physicians. His own doctor thereafter examined petitioner and pronounced him fit to work. When the railroad rejected petitioner's request for re-examination or restoration to service, he filed with the Railroad Adjustment Board a claim for reinstatement and back pay. The Board appointed a three-doctor committee, which found petitioner fit to act as an engineer. The Board, having interpreted seniority and other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement as guaranteeing petitioner's continued service while physically qualified, ordered his reinstatement with back pay for time lost. Upon the railroad's refusal to comply, petitioner brought this enforcement action in District Court. That court refused to uphold the Board's order, finding nothing in the collective bargaining agreement to limit the railroad's right to remove petitioner upon a medical disability finding by its physicians. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. The Adjustment Board, an experienced representative body created by 3 of the Railway Labor Act for settling disputes in the railroad industry, including interpretation of agreements, did not abuse its discretion by its interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement or its appointment of the medical board and reliance on its findings. Pp. 261-262.\n\n\n 2. A federal district court under 3 First (m) of the Railway Labor Act, which provides for finality of Adjustment Board awards \"except insofar as they shall contain a money award,\" cannot open up the Board's finding on the merits merely because its determination on the central issue of wrongful discharge included a money award. Pp. 263-264.\n\n\n 3. The District Court has power under the Act to determine the separable issue of the size of the money award for lost time; in making that determination, the court can evaluate any changes in \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n petitioner's health in the seven years since the Board heard and decided the case. Pp. 264-265.\n\n\n 336 F.2d 543, reversed and remanded.\n\nCharles W. Decker argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Clifton Hildebrand.\n\nWaldron A. Gregory argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was William R. Denton.\n\nClarence M. Mulholland, Edward J. Hickey, Jr., and Richard R. Lyman filed a brief for the Railway Labor Executives' Association, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, Gunther, worked as a fireman for respondent railroad for eight years, from 1916 to 1924, and as an engineer for 30 years, from 1924 until December 30, 1954. On that date, shortly after his seventy-first birthday, he was removed from active service because of an alleged physical disability. The railroad's action was taken on the basis of reports made by its physicians, after physical examinations of petitioner, that in their opinion he was no longer physically qualified to work as a locomotive engineer because his \"heart was in such condition that he would be likely to suffer an acute coronary episode.\" Dissatisfied with the railroad doctors' findings, Mr. Gunther went to a recognized specialist who, after examination, concluded that petitioner was qualified physically to continue work as an engineer. On the basis of this report petitioner requested the railroad to join him in the selection of a three-doctor board to re-examine his physical qualifications for return to service. The railroad refused. This disagreement led to prolonged litigation which has reached us 11 years after the controversy arose.\n\nWhen the railroad refused to consent to the appointment of a new board of doctors to re-examine petitioner \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n or to restore him to service, he filed a claim for reinstatement and back pay with the Railroad Adjustment Board, which was created by 3 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended,\n1\n to adjust, among other things, disputes of railroads and their employees \"growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning . . . rules, or working conditions . . . .\"\n2\n The Adjustment Board, over the protests of the railroad, decided it had jurisdiction of the grievance and then, referring to past practice in similar cases, proceeded, as its findings show, to appoint a committee of three qualified physicians, to re-examine petitioner, \"one chosen by carrier and one by the employe and the third by the two so selected, for the purpose of determining the facts as to claimant's disability and the propriety of his removal from service. . . .\" Subsequently, this committee of doctors examined petitioner and decided by a majority vote that he was physically qualified to act as an engineer, contrary to the prior findings of the railroad's doctors. Upon the basis of these findings the Adjustment Board decided that the railroad had been wrong in disqualifying petitioner for service and sustained his claim \"for reinstatement with pay for all time lost from October 15, 1955 . . . .\" The railroad refused to comply with the Board's order and petitioner as authorized by the Act\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n filed this action in a district court of the United States for an appropriate court order to enforce the Adjustment Board's award. After hearings the District Court, in its third opinion in the case, held the award erroneous and refused to enforce it.\n4\n The District Court's refusal was based on its conclusion that there were no express or implied provisions in the collective bargaining contract which in the court's judgment limited in any way what it found to be the absolute right of the railroad, in absence of such provisions, to remove petitioner from active service whenever its physicians found in good faith \"that plaintiff was physically disqualified from such service.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing with the interpretation put upon the contract by the District Court, and thereby rejected the Board's interpretation of the contract and its decision on the merits of the dispute. 336 F.2d 543. We granted certiorari because the holding of the two courts below seemed, in several respects, to run counter to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act as we have construed it. \n380 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\nI. Section 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act provides that \"disputes between an employee or group of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements\" are to be handled by the Adjustment Board. In 3 Congress has established an expert body to settle \"minor\" grievances like petitioner's which arise from day to day in the railroad industry. The Railroad Adjustment Board, composed equally of representatives of management and labor is peculiarly familiar with the thorny problems and the whole range of grievances that constantly exist in the railroad world. Its membership is in daily contact with workers and employers, and knows the industry's language, customs, and practices. See Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239, 243\n-244. The Board's decision here fairly read shows that it construed the collective bargaining provisions which secured seniority rights, together with other provisions of the contract, as justifying an interpretation of the contract guaranteeing to petitioner \"priority in service according to his seniority and pursuant to the agreement so long as he is physically qualified.\" The District Court, whose opinion was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, however, refused to accept the Board's interpretation of this contract. Paying strict attention only to the bare words of the contract and invoking old common-law rules for the interpretation of private employment contracts, the District Court found nothing in the agreement restricting the railroad's right to remove its employees for physical disability upon the good-faith findings of disability by its own physicians. Certainly it cannot be said that the Board's interpretation was wholly baseless and completely without reasons. We hold that the District Court and the Court of Appeals as well went beyond their province in rejecting the Adjustment Board's interpretation of this railroad collective bargaining agreement. As hereafter pointed out Congress, in the Railway Labor Act, invested the Adjustment Board \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n with the broad power to arbitrate grievances and plainly intended that interpretation of these controversial provisions should be submitted for the decision of railroad men, both workers and management, serving on the Adjustment Board with their long experience and accepted expertise in this field.\n\nII. The courts below were also of the opinion that the Board went beyond its jurisdiction in appointing a medical board of three physicians to decide for it the question of fact relating to petitioner's physical qualifications to act as an engineer. We do not agree. The Adjustment Board, of course, is not limited to common-law rules of evidence in obtaining information. The medical board was composed of three doctors, one of whom was appointed by the company, one by petitioner, and the third by these two doctors. This not only seems an eminently fair method of selecting doctors to perform this medical task but it appears from the record that it is commonly used in the railroad world for the very purpose it was used here. In fact the record shows that under respondent's present collective bargaining agreement with its engineers provision is made for determining a dispute precisely like the one before us by the appointment of a board of doctors in precisely the manner the Board used here. This Court has said that the Railway Labor Act's \"provisions dealing with the Adjustment Board were to be considered as compulsory arbitration in this limited field.\"\n5\n On a question like the one before us here, involving the health of petitioner, and his physical ability to operate an engine, arbitrators would probably find it difficult to find a better method for arriving at the truth than by the use of doctors selected as these doctors were. We reject the idea that the Adjustment \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n Board in some way breached its duty or went beyond its power in relying as it did upon the finding of this board of doctors.\n\nIII. Section 3 First (m) provides that Adjustment Board awards \"shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\"\n6\n The award of the Board in this case, based on the central finding that petitioner was wrongfully removed from service is twofold, consisting both of an order of reinstatement and the money award for lost earnings. Thus there arises the question of whether the District Court may open up the Board's finding on the merits that the railroad wrongfully removed petitioner from his job merely because one part of the Board's order contained a money award. We hold it cannot. This Court time and again has emphasized and re-emphasized that Congress intended minor grievances of railroad workers to be decided finally by the Railroad Adjustment Board. In Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & Indiana R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30\n, the Court gave a Board decision the same finality that a decision of arbitrators would have. In Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, \n360 \nU.S. 601\n, the Court discussed the legislative history of the Act at length and pointed out that it \"was designed for effective and final decision of grievances which arise daily\" and that its \"statutory scheme cannot realistically be squared with the contention that Congress did not purpose to foreclose litigation in the courts over grievances submitted to and disposed of by the Board . . . .\" \n360 \nU.S., at 616\n. Also in Locomotive Engineers v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n373 \nU.S. 33\n, the Court said that prior decisions of this Court had made it clear that the Adjustment Board provisions were to be considered as \"compulsory arbitration in this limited \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n field,\" p. 40, \"the complete and final means for settling minor disputes,\" p. 39, and \"a mandatory, exclusive, and comprehensive system for resolving grievance disputes.\" P. 38.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act as construed in the foregoing and other opinions of this Court does not allow a federal district court to review an Adjustment Board's determination of the merits of a grievance merely because a part of the Board's award, growing from its determination on the merits, is a money award. The basic grievance here - that is, the complaint that petitioner has been wrongfully removed from active service as an engineer because of health - has been finally, completely, and irrevocably settled by the Adjustment Board's decision. Consequently, the merits of the wrongful removal issue as decided by the Adjustment Board must be accepted by the District Court.\n\nIV. There remains the question of further proceedings in this case with respect to the money aspect of the Board's award. The Board did not determine the amount of back pay due petitioner on account of his wrongful removal from service. It merely sustained petitioner's claim for \"reinstatement with pay for all time lost from October 15, 1955.\" Though the Board's finding on the merits of the wrongful discharge must be accepted by the District Court, it has power under the Act to determine the size of the money award. The distinction between court review of the merits of a grievance and the size of the money award was drawn in Locomotive Engineers v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., supra, at pp. 40-41, when it was said that the computation of a time-lost award is \"an issue wholly separable from the merits of the wrongful discharge issue.\" On this separable issue the District Court may determine in this action how much time has been lost by reason of the wrongful removal of petitioner from active service, and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n any proper issues that can be raised with reference to the amount of money necessary to compensate for the time lost. In deciding this issue as to how much money petitioner will be entitled to receive because of lost time, the District Court will bear in mind the fact that the decision on the merits of the wrongful removal issue related to the time when the Board heard and decided the case. Seven years have elapsed since that time, long enough for many changes to have occurred in connection with petitioner's health. This would, of course, be relevant in determining the amount of money to be paid him in a lawsuit which can, as the statute provides, proceed on this separable issue \"in all respects as other civil suits\" where damages must be determined.\n\nThe judgments of the courts below are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for consideration not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.

MARINE ENGINEERS(1965)\nNo. 105\nArgued: October 12, 1965Decided: December 6, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners (Hanna) operate cargo vessels on the Great Lakes in interstate and foreign commerce. While negotiating for a new collective bargaining agreement with respondent Association (MEBA), which represented the licensed marine engineers on the ships, petitioners assertedly were informed by a majority of the engineers that they did not wish to be represented by MEBA. Hanna declined to negotiate until MEBA's majority status was determined by secret ballot, and MEBA replied by picketing Hanna's ships at Duluth and other ports, causing dock workers to refuse to unload. Hanna turned to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB): (1) It petitioned the Cleveland Regional Director to hold a representation election among its engineers to determine MEBA's status. The petition was dismissed on the ground that the engineers were \"supervisors\" and not \"employees\" under 2 (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The NLRB upheld this decision. (2) It filed charges with the Minneapolis Regional Director alleging that MEBA violated 8 (b) (4) (B) of the Act by inducing work stoppages among dockers at Duluth through improper secondary pressure. These charges were dismissed and the General Counsel agreed, stating that MEBA's conduct at Duluth and other sites did not exceed the bounds of lawful picketing under the NLRB's standards. (3) It filed charges with the Cleveland Regional Director accusing MEBA of organizational or recognitional picketing prohibited by 8 (b) (7) of the Act. The General Counsel affirmed the dismissal of the charges on the ground that MEBA fell outside the section since it sought to represent supervisors rather than employees. When shipping resumed in the spring and MEBA picketed Hanna ships in Superior, Hanna sued in a Wisconsin circuit court for injunctive relief from the picketing under state law. The Circuit Court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the state Supreme Court affirmed, holding that although the picketing could be deemed illegal under state law, it arguably violated 8 (b) (4) (B) and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 182]\n\u00a0\n 8 (b) (7) of the Act and fell within the NLRB's exclusive jurisdiction under San Diego Unions v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n. Held:\n\n 1. Under Garmon a State may not regulate conduct arguably \"protected by 7, or prohibited by 8\" of the Act, and the legislative purpose may require that certain activity neither protected nor prohibited be deemed privileged against state regulation. P. 187.\n\n\n 2. The NLRB decision that the marine engineers are supervisors and not \"employees\" eliminates most of the opportunities for preemption in this case. P. 188.\n\n\n  (a) Organizational or recognitional activity aimed at supervisors cannot be protected by 7 of the Act, arguably or otherwise. P. 188.\n\n\n  (b) Situations in which such activity can be prohibited by the Act are fewer than would be the case if \"employees\" were being organized or seeking recognition. P. 188.\n\n\n  (c) There can be no breach of 8 (b) (7), which limits organizational or recognitional picketing, since it applies only to picketing directed at \"employees.\" P. 188.\n\n\n 3. The enactment of 14 (a) of the Act was not a congressional decision to exclude state regulation of supervisory organizing. Pp. 189-190.\n\n\n 4. The NLRB's statement accompanying its refusal to order a representation election settles the supervisory status of the engineers \"with unclouded legal significance,\" so as to avoid preemption in the respects discussed. P. 190.\n\n\n 5. Section 8 (b) (4) (B) does not provide a ground for preemption in the circumstances of this case. Pp. 191-194.\n\n\n  (a) Petitioners claim there is no arguable violation on the basis of the finding of the Regional Director and General Counsel in declining to issue a complaint under 8 (b) (4) (B) with respect to the 1962 picketing. The General Counsel has statutory \"final authority, on behalf of the Board\" in the issuance of complaints, and his explicated determinations are entitled to great weight. Pp. 191-192.\n\n\n  (b) Hanna has offered to prove that the 1963 picketing at Superior was the same as the 1962 picketing at Superior, and if such proof is furnished, the chance that the picketing sought to be enjoined conceals a 8 (b) (4) (B) violation is remote. P. 192. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (c) Even if a 8 (b) (4) (B) violation were present, there would in this instance be no danger by a state injunction to interests served by the Garmon doctrine since the workers sought to be organized are outside the scope of the Act. Pp. 192-193.\n\n\n  (d) The presence of a 8 (b) (4) (B) violation would not result in the NLRB's affording complete protection to the legitimate interests of the State, as the primary picketing proviso of 8 (b) (4) (B) inhibits the use of that section fully to deal with the conduct complained of in this case. P. 194.\n\n\n 23 Wis. 2d 433, 127 N. W. 2d 393, reversed and remanded.\n\nJohn H. Hanninen argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was Lucian Y.

Come and Laurence S. Gold filed a brief for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe present controversy once again brings before the Court the troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation of union activities.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioners (\"Hanna\") are four corporations whose integrated fleet of Great Lakes vessels carries cargo in interstate and foreign commerce and is operated by one of the four, the Hanna Mining Company. The respondent District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (\"MEBA\")\n1\n represented the licensed marine engineers in Hanna's fleet under a collective bargaining agreement \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n terminating on July 15, 1962. According to Hanna, while negotiations for a new contract continued during August 1962, a majority of the marine engineers informed Hanna by written petitions that they did not wish to be represented by MEBA. Hanna then declined to negotiate further until MEBA's majority status was established by a secret ballot. Without acquiescing in this proposal or questioning any of the employee signatures on the petitions, MEBA responded on September 12, 1962, by picketing one of Hanna's ships unloading at a dock in Duluth, Minnesota, with signs giving the ship's name, stating that Hanna unfairly refused to negotiate with MEBA, and indicating that no dispute existed with any other employer. Because of the continued picketing, dock workers refused day after day to unload the ship. From September 12 until shipping ended for the winter, MEBA similarly picketed Hanna ships at other Great Lakes ports, including Superior, Wisconsin.\n\nHanna turned first to the National Labor Relations Board. On September 12, it petitioned the Regional Director at Cleveland, Ohio, to hold a representation election among Hanna's engineers to prove or disprove MEBA's majority status. The petition was dismissed at the end of September on the stated ground that the engineers were \"supervisors\" under 2 (11) of the National Labor Relations Act,\n2\n and automatically excluded from the Act's definition of \"employees\" under 2 (3),\n3\n so election proceedings under 9 were not warranted;\n4\n giving \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n the same reason, the Board in November declined to overturn this decision.\n5\n As a second measure, Hanna on September 15, 1962, filed charges with the Regional Director in Minneapolis, Minnesota, alleging that MEBA had violated 8 (b) (4) (B) of the Act,\n6\n by inducing work stoppages among dockers at Duluth through improper secondary pressure. In October, the Regional Director dismissed the charges and the General Counsel sustained the dismissal in December, stating the MEBA's conduct \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 186]\n\u00a0\n at Duluth and at other sites investigated did not exceed the bounds of lawful picketing under the Board's standards.\n7\n Hanna's third and last appeal to the Board came on September 27, 1962, when it filed charges with the Regional Director in Cleveland, Ohio, accusing MEBA of organizational or recognitional picketing improper under 8 (b) (7) of the Act.\n8\n The Regional Director dismissed the charge in October and in the next two months the General Counsel affirmed the dismissal because in seeking to represent \"supervisors\" rather than \"employees\" MEBA fell outside the section.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nWinter brought an end to both shipping and picketing for several months but when the navigation season opened in the spring of 1963 MEBA pickets once more appeared. After picketing occurred at Superior, Wisconsin, Hanna filed suit on June 24, 1963, in a Wisconsin circuit court. The complaint and affidavits alleged that MEBA was picketing Hanna's vessels at the docks of the Great Northern Railway Company at Superior in the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n same manner as the 1962 picketing and with the same improper aim of forcing its representation on unwilling engineers; Hanna stated that workers of other employers were refusing to render service to Hanna's vessels and it prayed for injunctive relief against further picketing of the vessels and the docks where they berthed and against any other attempt of MEBA to impose representation on Hanna engineers. The Circuit Court dismissed the suit in July for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. In April 1964 the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the decision. 23 Wis. 2d 433, 127 N. W. 2d 393. While agreeing that the picketing could be deemed illegal under Wisconsin law,\n10\n that court held that the picketing arguably violated 8 (b) (4) (B) and 8 (b) (7) of the federal labor Act and so fell within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction marked out in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n. In light of other language in Garmon the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the General Counsel's dismissal of charges under 8 (b) (4) (B) and 8 (b) (7) did not foreclose the possibility of a preempting violation, even assuming the 1963 picketing in Superior mirrored the 1962 picketing in Duluth. We invited the views of the United States, \n379 \nU.S. 942\n, granted certiorari, \n380 \nU.S. 941\n, and now reverse and remand.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe ground rules for preemption in labor law, emerging from our Garmon decision, should first be briefly summarized: in general, a State may not regulate conduct arguably \"protected by 7, or prohibited by 8\" of the National Labor Relations Act, see \n359 \nU.S., at 244\n-246; and the legislative purpose may further dictate that certain activity \"neither protected nor prohibited\" be deemed privileged against state regulation, cf. 359 \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 188]\n\u00a0\n U.S., at 245. For the reasons that follow, we believe the Board's decision that Hanna engineers are supervisors removes from this case most of the opportunities for preemption.\n\nWhen in 1947 the National Labor Relations Act was amended to exclude supervisory workers from the critical definition of \"employees,\" 2 (3), it followed that many provisions of the Act employing that pivotal term would cease to operate where supervisors were the focus of concern. Most obviously, 7 no longer bestows upon supervisory employees the rights to engage in self-organization, collective bargaining, and other concerted activities\n11\n under the umbrella of 8 of the Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 158 (1964 ed.). See Labor Board v. Budd Mfg. Co., 169 F.2d 571. Accordingly, activity designed to secure organization or recognition of supervisors cannot be protected by 7 of the Act, arguably or otherwise. Compare Labor Board v. Drivers Local Union, \n362 \nU.S. 274, 279\n. Correspondingly, the situations in which that same activity can be prohibited by the Act, even arguably, are fewer than would be the case if employees were being organized or seeking recognition. There can be no breach of 8 (b) (7), curtailing organizational or recognitional picketing, because there cannot exist the forbidden objective of requiring representation of \"employees\" by the picketing organization. Nor could one even advance the argument unsuccessfully urged in Drivers Local Union that 8 (b) (1) (A), 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S.C. 158 (b) (1) (A) (1964 ed.), condemns the picketing as restraint or coercion of employees exercising their 7 right not to organize or bargain collectively. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven though such efforts to unionize supervisors are not protected by the Act, or in the respects immediately relevant prohibited by it, the question arises whether Congress nonetheless desired that in their peaceful facets these efforts remain free from state regulation as well as Board authority. Compare Teamsters Union v. Morton, \n377 \nU.S. 252, 258\n-260. Arguing that the States are indeed powerless in this respect, MEBA pitches its case chiefly on the 1947 amendment of the \"employee\" definition and on the concurrent enactment of 14 (a) of the Act, 61 Stat. 151, 29 U.S.C. 164 (a) (1964 ed.), which provides in relevant part that \"[n]othing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization . . . .\" It is contended that the amendment and this section signify a federal policy of laissez faire toward supervisors ousting state as well as Board authority and, more particularly, that to allow the Wisconsin injunction would obliterate the opportunity for supervisor unions that Congress expressly reserved.\n\nThis broad argument fails utterly in light of the legislative history, for the Committee reports reveal that Congress' propelling intention was to relieve employers from any compulsion under the Act and under state law to countenance or bargain with any union of supervisory employees.\n12\n Whether the legislators fully realized that their method of achieving this result incidentally freed supervisors' unions from certain limitations under the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 190]\n\u00a0\n newly enacted 8 (b) is not wholly clear, but certainly Congress made no considered decision generally to exclude state limitations on supervisory organizing. As to the portion of 14 (a) quoted above, some legislative history suggests that it was not meant to immunize any conduct at all but only to make it \"clear that the amendments to the act do not prohibit supervisors from joining unions . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 28; H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 60 (\"[T]he first part of this provision [ 14 (a)] was included presumably out of an abundance of caution.\"). However, even assuming that 14 (a) itself intended also to make it clear that state law could not prohibit supervisors from joining unions, the section would have no application to the present facts; for picketing by a minority union to extract recognition by force of such pressures is decidedly not a sine qua non of collective bargaining, as indeed its limitation by 8 (b) (7) in nonsupervisor situations attests.\n\nThe remaining question in this phase of the case is whether the supervisory status of Hanna's engineers has been settled \"with unclouded legal significance,\" Garmon, \n359 \nU.S., at 246\n, so as to preclude arguable application of the Act in the respects discussed. We hold that the Board's statement accompanying its refusal to order a representation election does resolve the question with the clarity necessary to avoid preemption. While MEBA does not contend that the Board erred in its determination, an abstract difficulty arises from the lack of a statutory channel for judicial review of such a Board decision. Compare Hotel Employees v. Leedom, \n358 \nU.S. 99\n (equity action to obtain election). However, the usual deference to Board expertise in applying statutory terms to particular facts assures that its decision would in any event be respected in a high percentage of instances, and so diminished a risk of interference with \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 191]\n\u00a0\n federal labor policy does not justify use of the preemption doctrine to thwart state regulation bound to be legitimate on this score in almost all cases.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nA further basis for preemption, urged by MEBA and adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, is that the picketing at Superior exerted secondary pressure arguably violating 8 (b) (4) (B). The argument appears to be that a state injunction banishing the pickets inevitably impinges upon the Board's authority to regulate facets of the picketing that might exceed \"primary\" picketing and violate 8 (b) (4) (B)\n13\n - facets never specified by MEBA but presumably those that ignore the Board's limitations on time, location, and manner of common situs picketing. See Sailors' Union of the Pacific (Moore Dry Dock), 92 N. L. R. B. 547. However, as will appear, no arguable violation exists if Hanna's proof lives up to its allegations; further, even assuming a violation, federal interests normally justifying preemption are absent from this case.\n\nHanna's claim that there is no arguable violation rests, of course, on the finding made by the Regional Director and the General Counsel in declining to issue a complaint under 8 (b) (4) (B) with respect to MEBA's 1962 picketing. The Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to credit this finding because of this Court's comment in Garmon that the \"refusal of the General Counsel to file a charge\" is one of those dispositions \"which does not define the nature of the activity with unclouded legal significance.\" \n359 \nU.S., at 245\n-246. This language allows \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 192]\n\u00a0\n more than one interpretation, but we take it not to apply to those refusals of the General Counsel which are illuminated by explanations that do squarely define the nature of the activity. The General Counsel has statutory \"final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints,\" 3 (d) of the Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 139, 29 U.S.C. 153 (d) (1964 ed.), and his pronouncements in this context are entitled to great weight. The usual inability of the charging party to contest the General Counsel's adverse decision in the courts, see Hourihan v. Labor Board, 91 U.S. App. D.C. 316, 201 F.2d 187, does to be sure create a slight risk if state courts may proceed on this basis, but in the context of this case we believe the risk is too minimal to deserve recognition.\n\nEven taking the General Counsel's ruling at face value, MEBA stresses that the 8 (b) (4) (B) charge by Hanna concerned picketing in Duluth in September 1962 while the picketing before the Wisconsin court occurred at Superior in spring 1963. Yet Hanna accompanied the 1962 charge with information as to the 1962 picketing in several ports including Superior. The Regional Director is said to have conducted an investigation in Superior as well as in Duluth, and the General Counsel's letter on the 8 (b) (4) (B) charge appeared to state that activity at the sites other than Duluth also did not violate the Act. See n. 7, supra. And while some months intervened between the fall 1962 picketing at Superior and its resumption at that port in spring 1963, Hanna has offered to prove that the picketing remained the same in all significant respects including the picket signs employed, the location of the pickets, and the pickets' general behavior. If this proof is furnished, the chance that the picketing sought to be enjoined conceals a 8 (b) (4) (B) violation seems remote indeed.\n\nAdditionally, even if a 8 (b) (4) (B) violation were present, central interests served by the Garmon doctrine \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 193]\n\u00a0\n are not endangered by a state injunction when, in an instance such as this, the Board has established that the workers sought to be organized are outside the regime of the Act. Cf. Incres S. S. Co. v. Maritime Workers, \n372 \nU.S. 24\n. Most importantly, the Board's decision on the supervisory question determines, as we have already shown, that none of the conduct is arguably protected nor does it fall in some middle range impliedly withdrawn from state control.\n14\n Consequently, there is wholly absent the greatest threat against which the Garmon doctrine guards, a State's prohibition of activity that the Act indicates must remain unhampered.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 194]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor is this a case in which the presence of arguably prohibited activity may permit the Board to afford complete protection to the legitimate interests advanced by the State. Since Hanna as the primary employer is present at the picketed situs, the primary picketing proviso of 8 (b) (4) (B) severely inhibits the Board's use of that section to reach the volatile core of the conduct, the impact on secondary employers that follows from the mere presence of the pickets at a common situs. Section 8 (b) (7) which might provide full relief is rendered inapplicable by the supervisor ruling. Thus, so far as Garmon may proceed on the view that the opportunity belongs to the Board wherever it and the State offer duplicate relief, it has limited application to the present facts.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nIn concluding that the Act does not preempt the State's authority to quench the picketing said to have occurred in this case, we do not retreat from Garmon. Rather, we consider that neither the terms nor the policies of that decision justify its extension to the present facts, an extension producing untoward results noted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court itself. 23 Wis. 2d 433, 446, 127 N.

It merely relieves employers who are subject to the national act free from any compulsion by this National Board or any local agency to accord to the front line of management the anomalous status of employees.\" S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5. See also H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 13-17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] By contrast, sometimes offensive conduct may be restrained by a state remedy that has no impact at all on related activity arguably within the Board's exclusive province. See, e. g., Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., \n355 \nU.S. 131\n, upholding a state injunction against violence but setting it aside so far as it reached peaceful picketing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Aside from the 14 (a) line of argument already answered, we do not find at all apposite Teamsters Union v. Morton, \n377 \nU.S. 252\n, holding a State powerless to award damages against a striking union for requesting a secondary employer to cease business with the struck employer. While in Morton preemption was premised on the fact that the secondary pressure did not come within the ban fixed by 8 (b) (4) (B) and adopted by 303 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended, 73 Stat. 545, 29 U.S.C. 187 (a) (1964 ed.), the conduct there occurred in the context of a peaceful economic strike by employees, a sphere in which the federal interest is especially pervasive. By contrast the present case, involving secondary pressure wielded to impose representation on unwilling supervisors, finds itself at that far corner of labor law where, as we have shown, federal occupation is at a minimum and state power at a peak.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Hattiesburg Unions v. Broome Co., \n377 \nU.S. 126\n, cited to us by MEBA, may illustrate this concern. There, the union's organizational picketing at a common situs was enjoined by the State because its objective violated state law. In urging that the picketing's possible violation of 8 (b) (4) (B) preempted state authority, the Solicitor General suggested that it may also have been \"lawful picketing\" outside the State's reach so far as not prohibited by the section. Memorandum, p. 6, n. 7. See also Michelman, State Power To Govern Concerted Employee Activities, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 641, 652-653 (1961) (citations omitted): \"[A] state generally may not enjoin conduct thought to be a federal unfair labor practice. The reason is that, despite the state court's contrary belief, the conduct may, as a matter of federal law, be privileged.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In Marine Engineers v. Interlake Co., \n370 \nU.S. 173\n, we overturned a state ban on picketing arguably violating 8 (b) (4) (B); and to the counterargument that the picketing group was not a \"labor organization\" subject to 8 (b), we pointed out that this decision was for the Board. Unlike the present case, in Interlake the 8 (b) (4) (B) remedy had not been tried; but quite apart from that consideration, had the Board held the union a \"labor organization\" and also held those being organized to be \"employees\" - another point not recently decided by the Board - complete relief against the picketing might well have been available under 8 (b) (7). See \n370 \nU.S., at 182\n-183. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that 14 (a) does not evince a congressional decision to exclude state regulation of picketing aimed at organizing supervisors and securing the employer's recognition of the union. The question here, however, is whether Congress has excluded state regulation when that picketing also has secondary aspects arguably within the reach of 8 (b) (4) (B). I agree with the Court that state regulation is likewise not precluded in such case.\n\nThe proviso to 8 (b) (4) (B) expressly states \"[t]hat nothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing.\" (Emphasis supplied.) While Congress thus provided that primary picketing is not rendered unlawful under the Act merely by having secondary aspects, the italicized words of the proviso evince a congressional intention to leave undisturbed whatever other provisions of law regulate primary picketing. Ordinarily such regulation occurs under the National Labor Relations Act. The primary aspects of supervisory picketing are not, however, regulated by the federal Act; and I think the assumption that regulation will occur, which underlies the italicized words of the proviso, is strong enough to support the Court's conclusion that state regulation of supervisory organizational picketing is not preempted.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nIt is true that we said in Garmon that States have no power to regulate \"activities\" arguably subject to the federal Act; picketing which, because of its secondary aspects, is arguably subject to 8 (b) (4) (B) is, by one construction, an \"activity.\" But Garmon was not a case in which only incidental aspects of picketing were arguably \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 196]\n\u00a0\n subject to federal power and in which the alternative to state regulation was a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist. In this limited context, it is permissible to distinguish the primary from the secondary aspects of the picketing, and hold that the States may regulate the former, although preempted as to the latter, and although the necessary effect of regulation curbs both secondary and primary aspects of the picketing. This choice seems more consistent with the congressional meaning, since the alternative is to immunize the primary aspects of such common-situs picketing from state regulation, and that alternative finds no support either in policy or in the statute. Thus, I think that the Wisconsin courts may consider so much of the complaint as is addressed to the primary aspects of MEBA's picketing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It could be argued that this assumption supports a scope of state regulation no broader than that ordinarily provided by the federal Act. It is not necessary to resolve that argument here. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 181, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHANNA v.

The \"out-come-determination\" test of Guaranty Trust Co. v.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question to be decided is whether, in a civil action where the jurisdiction of the United States district court is based upon diversity of citizenship between the parties, service of process shall be made in the manner prescribed by state law or that set forth in Rule 4 (d) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nOn February 6, 1963, petitioner, a citizen of Ohio, filed her complaint in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, claiming damages in excess of $10,000 for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident in South Carolina, allegedly caused by the negligence of one Louise Plumer Osgood, a Massachusetts citizen deceased at the time of the filing of the complaint. Respondent, Mrs. Osgood's executor and also a Massachusetts citizen, was named as defendant. On February 8, service was made by leaving copies of the summons and the complaint with respondent's wife at his residence, concededly in compliance with Rule 4 (d) (1), which provides:\n\n \"The summons and complaint shall be served together. The plaintiff shall furnish the person making service with such copies as are necessary. Service shall be made as follows:\n\n\n \"(1) Upon an individual other than an infant or an incompetent person, by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein . . . .\"\n\n\n Respondent filed his answer on February 26, alleging, inter alia, that the action could not be maintained because it had been brought \"contrary to and in violation of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n provisions of Massachusetts General Laws (Ter. Ed.) Chapter 197, Section 9.\" That section provides:\n\n\"Except as provided in this chapter, an executor or administrator shall not be held to answer to an action by a creditor of the deceased which is not commenced within one year from the time of his giving bond for the performance of his trust, or to such an action which is commenced within said year unless before the expiration thereof the writ in such action has been served by delivery in hand upon such executor or administrator or service thereof accepted by him or a notice stating the name of the estate, the name and address of the creditor, the amount of the claim and the court in which the action has been brought has been filed in the proper registry of probate. . . .\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c. 197, 9 (1958).\n\n\n On October 17, 1963, the District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, citing Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 530\n, and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99\n, in support of its conclusion that the adequacy of the service was to be measured by 9, with which, the court held, petitioner had not complied. On appeal, petitioner admitted noncompliance with 9, but argued that Rule 4 (d) (1) defines the method by which service of process is to be effected in diversity actions. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, finding that \"[r]elatively recent amendments [to 9] evince a clear legislative purpose to require personal notification within the year,\"\n1\n concluded that the conflict of state \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n and federal rules was over \"a substantive rather than a procedural matter,\" and unanimously affirmed. 331 F.2d 157. Because of the threat to the goal of uniformity of federal procedure posed by the decision below,\n2\n we granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 813\n.\n\nWe conclude that the adoption of Rule 4 (d) (1), designed to control service of process in diversity actions,\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n neither exceeded the congressional mandate embodied in the Rules Enabling Act nor transgressed constitutional bounds, and that the Rule is therefore the standard against which the District Court should have measured the adequacy of the service. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. 2072 (1958 ed.), provides, in pertinent part:\n\n \"The Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe, by general rules, the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions, and the practice and procedure of the district courts of the United States in civil actions.\n\n\n \"Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right and shall preserve the right of trial by jury . . . .\"\n\n\n Under the cases construing the scope of the Enabling Act, Rule 4 (d) (1) clearly passes muster. Prescribing the manner in which a defendant is to be notified that a suit has been instituted against him, it relates to the \"practice and procedure of the district courts.\" Cf. Insurance Co. v. Bangs, \n103 \nU.S. 435, 439\n.\n\n\"The test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure, - the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\" Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 1, 14\n.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n In Mississippi Pub. Corp. v. Murphree, \n326 \nU.S. 438\n, this Court upheld Rule 4 (f), which permits service of a summons anywhere within the State (and not merely the district) in which a district court sits:\n\n \"We think that Rule 4 (f) is in harmony with the Enabling Act . . . . Undoubtedly most alterations \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 465]\n\u00a0\n of the rules of practice and procedure may and often do affect the rights of litigants. Congress' prohibition of any alteration of substantive rights of litigants was obviously not addressed to such incidental effects as necessarily attend the adoption of the prescribed new rules of procedure upon the rights of litigants who, agreeably to rules of practice and procedure, have been brought before a court authorized to determine their rights. Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 1, 11\n-14. The fact that the application of Rule 4 (f) will operate to subject petitioner's rights to adjudication by the district court for northern Mississippi will undoubtedly affect those rights. But it does not operate to abridge, enlarge or modify the rules of decision by which that court will adjudicate its rights.\" Id., at 445-446.\n\n\n Thus were there no conflicting state procedure, Rule 4 (d) (1) would clearly control. National Rental v. Szukhent, \n375 \nU.S. 311, 316\n. However, respondent, focusing on the contrary Massachusetts rule, calls to the Court's attention another line of cases, a line which - like the Federal Rules - had its birth in 1938. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, overruling Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, held that federal courts sitting in diversity cases, when deciding questions of \"substantive\" law, are bound by state court decisions as well as state statutes. The broad command of Erie was therefore identical to that of the Enabling Act: federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. However, as subsequent cases sharpened the distinction between substance and procedure, the line of cases following Erie diverged markedly from the line construing the Enabling Act. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99\n, made it clear that Erie-type problems were not to be solved by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 466]\n\u00a0\n reference to any traditional or common-sense substance-procedure distinction:\n\n \"And so the question is not whether a statute of limitations is deemed a matter of `procedure' in some sense. The question is . . . does it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?\" \n326 \nU.S., at 109\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n Respondent, by placing primary reliance on York and Ragan, suggests that the Erie doctrine acts as a check on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that despite the clear command of Rule 4 (d) (1), Erie and its progeny demand the application of the Massachusetts rule. Reduced to essentials, the argument is: (1) Erie, as refined in York, demands that federal courts apply state law whenever application of federal law in its stead will alter the outcome of the case. (2) In this case, a determination that the Massachusetts service requirements obtain will result in immediate victory for respondent. If, on the other hand, it should be held that Rule 4 (d) (1) is applicable, the litigation will continue, with possible victory for petitioner. (3) Therefore, Erie demands application of the Massachusetts rule. The syllogism possesses an appealing simplicity, but is for several reasons invalid.\n\nIn the first place, it is doubtful that, even if there were no Federal Rule making it clear that in-hand service is not required in diversity actions, the Erie rule would have obligated the District Court to follow the Massachusetts procedure. \"Outcome-determination\" analysis was never \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 467]\n\u00a0\n intended to serve as a talisman. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative, \n356 \nU.S. 525, 537\n. Indeed, the message of York itself is that choices between state and federal law are to be made not by application of any automatic, \"litmus paper\" criterion, but rather by reference to the policies underlying the Erie rule. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 108-112.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Erie rule is rooted in part in a realization that it would be unfair for the character or result of a litigation materially to differ because the suit had been brought in a federal court.\n\n\"Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction was conferred in order to prevent apprehended discrimination in state courts against those not citizens of the State. Swift v. Tyson introduced grave discrimination by non-citizens against citizens. It made rights enjoyed under the unwritten `general law' vary according to whether enforcement was sought in the state or in the federal court; and the privilege of selecting the court in which the right should be determined was conferred upon the non-citizen. Thus, the doctrine rendered impossible equal protection of the law.\" Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, at 74-75.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n The decision was also in part a reaction to the practice of \"forum-shopping\" which had grown up in response to the rule of Swift v. Tyson. \n304 \nU.S., at 73\n-74.\n8\n That the York test was an attempt to effectuate these policies is demonstrated by the fact that the opinion framed the inquiry in terms of \"substantial\" variations between state \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 468]\n\u00a0\n and federal litigation. \n326 \nU.S., at 109\n. Not only are nonsubstantial, or trivial, variations not likely to raise the sort of equal protection problems which troubled the Court in Erie; they are also unlikely to influence the choice of a forum. The \"outcome-determination\" test therefore cannot be read without reference to the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe difference between the conclusion that the Massachusetts rule is applicable, and the conclusion that it is not, is of course at this point \"outcome-determinative\" in the sense that if we hold the state rule to apply, respondent prevails, whereas if we hold that Rule 4 (d) (1) governs, the litigation will continue. But in this sense every procedural variation is \"outcome-determinative.\" For example, having brought suit in a federal court, a plaintiff cannot then insist on the right to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 469]\n\u00a0\n file subsequent pleadings in accord with the time limits applicable in the state courts, even though enforcement of the federal timetable will, if he continues to insist that he must meet only the state time limit, result in determination of the controversy against him. So it is here. Though choice of the federal or state rule will at this point have a marked effect upon the outcome of the litigation, the difference between the two rules would be of scant, if any, relevance to the choice of a forum. Petitioner, in choosing her forum, was not presented with a situation where application of the state rule would wholly bar recovery;\n10\n rather, adherence to the state rule would have resulted only in altering the way in which process was served.\n11\n Moreover, it is difficult to argue that permitting service of defendant's wife to take the place of in-hand service of defendant himself alters the mode of enforcement of state-created rights in a fashion sufficiently \"substantial\" to raise the sort of equal protection problems to which the Erie opinion alluded.\n\nThere is, however, a more fundamental flaw in respondent's syllogism: the incorrect assumption that the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins constitutes the appropriate test \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 470]\n\u00a0\n of the validity and therefore the applicability of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. The Erie rule has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule. It is true that there have been cases where this Court has held applicable a state rule in the face of an argument that the situation was governed by one of the Federal Rules. But the holding of each such case was not that Erie commanded displacement of a Federal Rule by an inconsistent state rule, but rather that the scope of the Federal Rule was not as broad as the losing party urged, and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which covered the point in dispute, Erie commanded the enforcement of state law.\n\n \"Respondent contends, in the first place, that the charge was correct because of the fact that Rule 8 (c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure makes contributory negligence an affirmative defense. We do not agree. Rule 8 (c) covers only the manner of pleading. The question of the burden of establishing contributory negligence is a question of local law which federal courts in diversity of citizenship cases (Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n) must apply.\" Palmer v. Hoffman, \n318 \nU.S. 109, 117\n.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n (Here, of course, the clash is unavoidable; Rule 4 (d) (1) says - implicitly, but with unmistakable clarity - that in-hand service is not required in federal courts.) At the same time, in cases adjudicating the validity of Federal Rules, we have not applied the York rule or other refinements of Erie, but have to this day continued to decide questions concerning the scope of the Enabling Act and the constitutionality of specific Federal Rules in light of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 471]\n\u00a0\n the distinction set forth in Sibbach. E. g., Schlagenhauf v. Holder, \n379 \nU.S. 104\n.\n\nNor has the development of two separate lines of cases been inadvertent. The line between \"substance\" and \"procedure\" shifts as the legal context changes. \"Each implies different variables depending upon the particular problem for which it is used.\" Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 108; Cook, The Logical and Legal Bases of the Conflict of Laws, pp. 154-183 (1942). It is true that both the Enabling Act and the Erie rule say, roughly, that federal courts are to apply state \"substantive\" law and federal \"procedural\" law, but from that it need not follow that the tests are identical. For they were designed to control very different sorts of decisions. When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided Erie choice: the court has been instructed to apply the Federal Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the Rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor constitutional restrictions.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nWe are reminded by the Erie opinion\n14\n that neither Congress nor the federal courts can, under the guise of formulating rules of decision for federal courts, fashion rules which are not supported by a grant of federal authority contained in Article I or some other section of the Constitution; in such areas state law must govern \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 472]\n\u00a0\n because there can be no other law. But the opinion in Erie, which involved no Federal Rule and dealt with a question which was \"substantive\" in every traditional sense (whether the railroad owed a duty of care to Tompkins as a trespasser or a licensee), surely neither said nor implied that measures like Rule 4 (d) (1) are unconstitutional. For the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. Cf. M`Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421. Neither York nor the cases following it ever suggested that the rule there laid down for coping with situations where no Federal Rule applies is coextensive with the limitation on Congress to which Erie had adverted. Although this Court has never before been confronted with a case where the applicable Federal Rule is in direct collision with the law of the relevant State,\n15\n courts of appeals faced with such clashes have rightly discerned the implications of our decisions.\n\n \"One of the shaping purposes of the Federal Rules is to bring about uniformity in the federal courts by getting away from local rules. This is especially true of matters which relate to the administration of legal proceedings, an area in which federal courts \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 473]\n\u00a0\n have traditionally exerted strong inherent power, completely aside from the powers Congress expressly conferred in the Rules. The purpose of the Erie doctrine, even as extended in York and Ragan, was never to bottle up federal courts with `outcome-determinative' and `integral-relations' stoppers - when there are `affirmative countervailing [federal] considerations' and when there is a Congressional mandate (the Rules) supported by constitutional authority.\" Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co. v. Wright, 322 F.2d 759, 764 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1963).\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n Erie and its offspring cast no doubt on the long-recognized power of Congress to prescribe housekeeping rules for federal courts even though some of those rules will inevitably differ from comparable state rules. Cf. Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., \n283 \nU.S. 91\n. \"When, because the plaintiff happens to be a non-resident, such a right is enforceable in a federal as well as in a State court, the forms and mode of enforcing the right may at times, naturally enough, vary because the two judicial systems are not identic.\" Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 108; Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 555\n. Thus, though a court, in measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the Enabling Act and the Constitution, need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts, Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., supra, at 13-14, it cannot be forgotten that the Erie rule, and the guidelines suggested in York, were created to serve another purpose altogether. To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing state-created rights would be to disembowel \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 474]\n\u00a0\n either the Constitution's grant of power over federal procedure or Congress' attempt to exercise that power in the Enabling Act.\n17\n Rule 4 (d) (1) is valid and controls the instant case.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 9 is in part a statute of limitations, providing that an executor need not \"answer to an action . . . which is not commenced within one year from the time of his giving bond . . . .\" This part of the statute, the purpose of which is to speed the settlement of estates, Spaulding v. McConnell, 307 Mass. 144, 146, 29 N. E. 2d 713, 715 (1940); Doyle v. Moylan, 141 F. Supp. 95 (D.C. D. Mass. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n 1956), is not involved in this case, since the action clearly was timely commenced. (Respondent filed bond on March 1, 1962; the complaint was filed February 6, 1963, and the service - the propriety of which is in dispute - was made on February 8, 1963.) 331 F.2d, at 159. Cf. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra; Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., supra. Section 9 also provides for the manner of service. Generally, service of process must be made by \"delivery in hand,\" although there are two alternatives: acceptance of service by the executor, or filing of a notice of claim, the components of which are set out in the statute, in the appropriate probate court. The purpose of this part of the statute, which is involved here, is, as the court below noted, to insure that executors will receive actual notice of claims. Parker v. Rich, 297 Mass. 111, 113-114, 8 N. E. 2d 345, 347 (1937). Actual notice is of course also the goal of Rule 4 (d) (1); however, the Federal Rule reflects a determination that this goal can be achieved by a method less cumbersome than that prescribed in 9. In this case the goal seems to have been achieved; although the affidavit filed by respondent in the District Court asserts that he had not been served in hand nor had he accepted service, it does not allege lack of actual notice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There are a number of state service requirements which would not necessarily be satisfied by compliance with Rule 4 (d) (1). See, e. g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code 411 8; Idaho Code Ann. 5-507 7 (1948); Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 110, 13.2 (1963); Ky. Rev. Stat., Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 4.04 (1962); Md. Ann.

In support of its suggestion that 9 serves some interest the State regards as vital to its citizens, the court noted that something like 9 has been on the books in Massachusetts a long time, that 9 has been amended a number of times, and that 9 is designed to make sure that executors receive actual notice. See note 1, supra. The apparent lack of relation among these three observations is not surprising, because it is not clear to what sort of question the Court of Appeals was addressing itself. One cannot meaningfully ask how important something is without first asking \"important for what purpose?\" Erie and its progeny make clear that when a federal court sitting in a diversity case is faced with a question of whether or not to apply state law, the importance of a state rule is indeed relevant, but only in the context of asking whether application of the rule would make so important a difference to the character or result of the litigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or whether application of the rule would have so important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, at 108-109; Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., supra, at 532; Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., supra, note 5, at 538. Similarly, a federal court's refusal to enforce the New Jersey rule involved in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n, requiring the posting of security by plaintiffs in stockholders' derivative actions, might well impel a stockholder to choose to bring suit in the federal, rather than the state, court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf. Monarch Insurance Co. of Ohio v. Spach, 281 F.2d 401, 412 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1960). We cannot seriously entertain the thought that one suing an estate would be led to choose the federal court because of a belief that adherence to Rule 4 (d) (1) is less likely to give the executor actual notice than 9, and therefore more likely to produce a default judgment. Rule 4 (d) (1) is well designed to give actual notice, as it did in this case. See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] To the same effect, see Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., supra; Cohen v.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nIt is unquestionably true that up to now Erie and the cases following it have not succeeded in articulating a workable doctrine governing choice of law in diversity actions. I respect the Court's effort to clarify the situation in today's opinion. However, in doing so I think it has misconceived the constitutional premises of Erie and has failed to deal adequately with those past decisions upon which the courts below relied.\n\nErie was something more than an opinion which worried about \"forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws,\" ante, p. 468, although to be sure these were important elements of the decision. I have always regarded that decision as one of the modern cornerstones of our federalism, expressing policies that profoundly touch the allocation of judicial power between the state and federal systems. Erie recognized that there should not be two conflicting systems of law controlling the primary activity of citizens, for such alternative governing authority must necessarily give rise to a debilitating uncertainty in the planning of everyday affairs.\n1\n And it recognized that the scheme of our Constitution envisions an allocation of law-making functions between state and federal legislative processes which is undercut if the federal judiciary can make substantive law affecting \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 475]\n\u00a0\n state affairs beyond the bounds of congressional legislative powers in this regard. Thus, in diversity cases Erie commands that it be the state law governing primary private activity which prevails.\n\nThe shorthand formulations which have appeared in some past decisions are prone to carry untoward results that frequently arise from oversimplification. The Court is quite right in stating that the \"outcome-determinative\" test of Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \n326 \nU.S. 99\n, if taken literally, proves too much, for any rule, no matter how clearly \"procedural,\" can affect the outcome of litigation if it is not obeyed. In turning from the \"outcome\" test of York back to the unadorned forum-shopping rationale of Erie, however, the Court falls prey to like over-simplification, for a simple forum-shopping rule also proves too much; litigants often choose a federal forum merely to obtain what they consider the advantages of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or to try their cases before a supposedly more favorable judge. To my mind the proper line of approach in determining whether to apply a state or a federal rule, whether \"substantive\" or \"procedural,\" is to stay close to basic principles by inquiring if the choice of rule would substantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation.\n2\n If so, Erie and the Constitution require that the state rule prevail, even in the face of a conflicting federal rule.\n\nThe Court weakens, if indeed it does not submerge, this basic principle by finding, in effect, a grant of substantive legislative power in the constitutional provision for a federal \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 476]\n\u00a0\n court system (compare Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1), and through it, setting up the Federal Rules as a body of law inviolate.\n\n\"[T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system . . . carries with it congressional power . . . to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either.\" Ante, p. 472. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n So long as a reasonable man could characterize any duly adopted federal rule as \"procedural,\" the Court, unless I misapprehend what is said, would have it apply no matter how seriously it frustrated a State's substantive regulation of the primary conduct and affairs of its citizens. Since the members of the Advisory Committee, the Judicial Conference, and this Court who formulated the Federal Rules are presumably reasonable men, it follows that the integrity of the Federal Rules is absolute. Whereas the unadulterated outcome and forum-shopping tests may err too far toward honoring state rules, I submit that the Court's \"arguably procedural, ergo constitutional\" test moves too fast and far in the other direction.\n\nThe courts below relied upon this Court's decisions in Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 530\n, and Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n. Those cases deserve more attention than this Court has given them, particularly Ragan which, if still good law, would in my opinion call for affirmance of the result reached by the Court of Appeals. Further, a discussion of these two cases will serve to illuminate the \"diversity\" thesis I am advocating.\n\nIn Ragan a Kansas statute of limitations provided that an action was deemed commenced when service was made on the defendant. Despite Federal Rule 3 which provides that an action commences with the filing of the complaint, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 477]\n\u00a0\n the Court held that for purposes of the Kansas statute of limitations a diversity tort action commenced only when service was made upon the defendant. The effect of this holding was that although the plaintiff had filed his federal complaint within the state period of limitations, his action was barred because the federal marshal did not serve a summons on the defendant until after the limitations period had run. I think that the decision was wrong. At most, application of the Federal Rule would have meant that potential Kansas tort defendants would have to defer for a few days the satisfaction of knowing that they had not been sued within the limitations period. The choice of the Federal Rule would have had no effect on the primary stages of private activity from which torts arise, and only the most minimal effect on behavior following the commission of the tort. In such circumstances the interest of the federal system in proceeding under its own rules should have prevailed.\n\nCohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp. held that a federal diversity court must apply a state statute requiring a small stockholder in a stockholder derivative suit to post a bond securing payment of defense costs as a condition to prosecuting an action. Such a statute is not \"outcome determinative\"; the plaintiff can win with or without it. The Court now rationalizes the case on the ground that the statute might affect the plaintiff's choice of forum (ante, p. 469, n. 10), but as has been pointed out, a simple forum-shopping test proves too much. The proper view of Cohen is, in my opinion, that the statute was meant to inhibit small stockholders from instituting \"strike suits,\" and thus it was designed and could be expected to have a substantial impact on private primary activity. Anyone who was at the trial bar during the period when Cohen arose can appreciate the strong state policy reflected in the statute. I think it wholly legitimate to view Federal Rule 23 as not purporting to deal \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 478]\n\u00a0\n with the problem. But even had the Federal Rules purported to do so, and in so doing provided a substantially less effective deterrent to strike suits, I think the state rule should still have prevailed. That is where I believe the Court's view differs from mine; for the Court attributes such overriding force to the Federal Rules that it is hard to think of a case where a conflicting state rule would be allowed to operate, even though the state rule reflected policy considerations which, under Erie, would lie within the realm of state legislative authority.\n\nIt remains to apply what has been said to the present case. The Massachusetts rule provides that an executor need not answer suits unless in-hand service was made upon him or notice of the action was filed in the proper registry of probate within one year of his giving bond. The evident intent of this statute is to permit an executor to distribute the estate which he is administering without fear that further liabilities may be outstanding for which he could be held personally liable. If the Federal District Court in Massachusetts applies Rule 4 (d) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure instead of the Massachusetts service rule, what effect would that have on the speed and assurance with which estates are distributed? As I see it, the effect would not be substantial. It would mean simply that an executor would have to check at his own house or the federal courthouse as well as the registry of probate before he could distribute the estate with impunity. As this does not seem enough to give rise to any real impingement on the vitality of the state policy which the Massachusetts rule is intended to serve, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Since the rules involved in the present case are parallel rather than conflicting, this first rationale does not come into play here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 678. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Coop., Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 525, 536\n-540, indicated that state procedures would apply if the State had manifested a particularly strong interest in their employment. Compare Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 359\n. However, this approach may not be of constitutional proportions. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 460, 479]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARMAN v.

The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain: the state statutes are clear and unambiguous, the rights allegedly impaired are the fundamental civil rights of a broad class of citizens, and the immediacy of the problem facing the District Court was evident. Pp. 534-537.\n\n\n 2. The certificate of residence requirement is a material requirement imposed upon those who refuse to surrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying a poll tax and thus constitutes an abridgment of the right to vote in violation of the Twenty-fourth Amendment. Pp. 538-544.\n\n\n (a) The poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting in federal elections, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed. P. 542.\n\n\n (b) The statutory scheme may not be saved on the ground that the certificate of residence requirement is a necessary method of proving residence, for constitutional deprivations may not be justified by some remote administrative benefit to the State. Pp. 542-544.\n\n\n 235 F. Supp. 66, affirmed. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJoseph C. Carter, Jr., argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs were Robert Y. Button, Attorney General of Virginia, Richard N. Harris, Assistant Attorney General, and E. Milton Farley III.\n\nH. E. Widener, Jr., argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were L. S. Parsons, Jr., John N. Dalton and Bentley Hite.\n\nHarold H. Greene, by special leave of Court, argued the cause for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Marshall, Louis F. Claiborne and David Rubin.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe are called upon in this case to construe, for the first time, the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States:\n\n \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.\"\n\n\n The precise issue is whether 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code - which provides that in order to qualify to vote in federal elections one must either pay a poll tax or file a witnessed or notarized certificate of residence\n1\n - contravenes this command. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to the adoption of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the Virginia Constitution (Art. II, 18-20) and statutes (Va. Code Ann. 24-17, 24-67 (1950)) established uniform standards for qualification for voting in both federal and state elections. The requirements were: (1) United States citizenship; (2) a minimum age of twenty-one; (3) residence in the State for one year, in the city or county for six months, and in the voting precinct for thirty days; and (4) payment \"at least six months prior to the election . . . to the proper officer all State \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n poll taxes [$1.50 annually] assessed or assessable against him for three years next preceding such election.\"\n2\n The statutes further provided for permanent registration.\n3\n Once registered, the voters could qualify for elections in subsequent years merely by paying the poll taxes.\n\nIn 1963, in anticipation of the promulgation of the Twenty-fourth Amendment, the Governor of Virginia convened a special session of the Virginia General Assembly. On November 21 of that year, the General Assembly enacted two Acts\n4\n designed\n\n\"(1) to enable persons to register and vote in Federal elections without the payment of poll tax or other tax as required by the 24th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, (2) to continue in effect in all other elections the present registration and voting requirements of the Constitution of Virginia, and (3) to provide methods by which all persons registered to vote in Federal or other elections may prove that they meet the residence requirements of Section 18 of the Constitution of Virginia.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n No changes were made with regard to qualification for voting in state elections. With regard to federal elections, however, the payment of a poll tax as an absolute prerequisite to registration and voting was eliminated, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n and a provision was added requiring the federal voter to file a certificate of residence in each election year or, at his option, to pay the customary poll taxes. The statute provides that the certificate of residence must be filed no earlier than October 1 of the year immediately preceding that in which the voter desires to vote and not later than six months prior to the election. The voter must state in the certificate (which must be notarized or witnessed) his present address, that he is currently a resident of Virginia, that he has been a resident since the date of his registration, and that he does not presently intend to remove from the city or county of which he is a resident prior to the next general election. Va. Code Ann. 24-17.2 (1964 Supp.). Thus, as a result of the 1963 Acts, a citizen after registration may vote in both federal and state elections upon the payment of all assessable poll taxes. Va. Code Ann. 24-17 (1964 Supp.). If he has not paid such taxes he cannot vote in state elections, and may vote in federal elections only upon filing a certificate of residence in each election year. Va. Code Ann. 24-17.1, 24-17.2 (1964 Supp.).\n\nThe present appeal originated as two separate class actions, brought by appellees in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, attacking the foregoing provisions of the 1963 Virginia legislation as violative of Art. I, 2, of the Constitution of the United States, and the Fourteenth, Seventeenth, and Twenty-fourth Amendments thereto. The complaints, which prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief, named as defendants (appellants here) the three members of the Virginia State Board of Elections and, in one case, the County Treasurer of Roanoke County, Virginia, and, in the other, the Director of Finance of Fairfax County. The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1343, 2201 (1958 ed.), and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n a court of three judges was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284 (1958 ed.).\n\nThe District Court denied the State's motion to stay the proceedings in order to give the Virginia courts an opportunity to resolve the issues and interpret the statutes involved. The court further denied the State's motions to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties. for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, and for want of a justiciable controversy.\n6\n On the merits, the District Court held that the certificate of residence requirement was \"a distinct qualification or at least an \"increase [in] the quantum of necessary proof of residence\" imposed solely on the federal voter, and that it therefore violated Art. I, 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment, which provide that electors choosing a Representative or Senator in the Congress of the United States \"shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\" The court rejected the argument that the residency certificate was merely a method, like the poll tax, of proving the residence qualification which is imposed on both federal and state voters. Accordingly, the District Court entered an order declaring invalid the portions of the 1963 Virginia legislation which required the filing of a certificate of residence and enjoining appellants from requiring compliance by a voter with said portions of the 1963 Acts. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n379 \nU.S. 810\n.\n\nWe hold that 24-17.2 is repugnant to the Twenty-fourth Amendment and affirm the decision of the District \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n Court on that basis. We therefore find it unnecessary to determine whether that section violates Art. I, 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAt the outset, we are faced with the State's contention that the District Court should have stayed the proceedings until the courts of Virginia had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on underlying issues of state law and to construe the statutes involved. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction.\n\nIn applying the doctrine of abstention, a federal district court is vested with discretion to decline to exercise or to postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction in deference to state court resolution of underlying issues of state law. Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n.\n7\n Where resolution of the federal constitutional question is dependent upon, or may be materially altered by, the determination of an uncertain issue of state law, abstention may be proper in order to avoid unnecessary friction in federal-state relations, interference with important state functions, tentative decisions on questions of state law, and premature constitutional adjudication. E. g., Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., supra. The doctrine, however, contemplates that deference to state court adjudication only be made where the issue of state law is uncertain. Davis v. Mann, \n377 \nU.S. 678, 690\n; McNeese v. Board of Education, \n373 \nU.S. 668, 673\n-674; Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77, 84\n.\n8\n If the state statute \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 535]\n\u00a0\n in question, although never interpreted by a state tribunal, is not fairly subject to an interpretation which will render unnecessary or substantially modify the federal constitutional question, it is the duty of the federal court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction. Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 375\n-379. Thus, \"recognition of the role of state courts as the final expositors of state law implies no disregard for the primacy of the federal judiciary in deciding questions of federal law.\" England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411, 415\n-416.\n\nThe state statutes involved here are clear and unambiguous in all material respects.\n9\n While the State suggests that the Virginia tribunals are \"unquestionably far better equipped than the lower [federal] court to unravel the skeins of local law and administrative practices in which the Appellees' claims are entangled,\"\n10\n the State \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n does not point to any provision in the legislation which leaves \"reasonable room for a construction by the Virginia courts which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem.\" Harrison v. NAACP, \n360 \nU.S. 167, 177\n.\n\nIn spite of the clarity of the 1963 legislation, the State argues that the District Court should have abstained on the ground that if the certificate of residence requirement were found to be a qualification distinct from those specified in the Virginia Constitution, it would be invalid as a matter of Virginia law and \"a crucial federal constitutional issue would accordingly disappear from the case.\" We find little force in this argument. The section of the Virginia Constitution (Art. II, 18) on which the State relies expressly limits the franchise to citizens who have met certain residency requirements.\n11\n The statute in issue, 24-17.2, requires the voter to certify that he meets those residence requirements. It is thus difficult to envisage how 24-17.2 could be construed as setting forth a qualification not found in the Virginia Constitution.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 537]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the clarity of the Virginia statutes, support for the District court's refusal to stay the proceedings is found in the nature of the constitutional deprivation alleged and the probable consequences of abstaining. Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, \n377 \nU.S. 218, 229\n; Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 375\n-379. The District Court was faced with two class actions attacking a statutory scheme allegedly impairing the right to vote in violation of Art. I, 2, and the Fourteenth, Seventeenth and Twenty-fourth Amendments. As this Court has stressed on numerous occasions, \"[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.\" Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533, 555\n. The right is fundamental \"because preservative of all rights.\" Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 370\n. In appraising the motion to stay proceedings, the District Court was thus faced with a claimed impairment of the fundamental civil rights of a broad class of citizens. The motion was heard about two months prior to the deadline for meeting the statutory requirements and just eight months before the 1964 general elections. Given the importance and immediacy of the problem, and the delay inherent in referring questions of state law to state tribunals,\n13\n it is evident that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain. Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, \n377 \nU.S. 218, 229\n; Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 375\n-379.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nReaching the merits, it is important to emphasize that the question presented is not whether it would be within a State's power to abolish entirely the poll tax and require all voters - state and federal - to file annually a certificate of residence. Rather, the issue here is whether the State of Virginia may constitutionally confront the federal voter with a requirement that he either pay the customary poll taxes as required for state elections or file a certificate of residence. We conclude that this requirement constitutes an abridgment of the right to vote in federal elections in contravention of the Twenty-fourth Amendment.\n\nPrior to the proposal of the Twenty-fourth Amendment in 1962, federal legislation to eliminate poll taxes, either by constitutional amendment or statute, had been introduced in every Congress since 1939. The House of Representatives passed anti-poll tax bills on five occasions and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 539]\n\u00a0\n the Senate twice proposed constitutional amendments.\n15\n Even though in 1962 only five States retained the poll tax as a voting requirement, Congress reflected widespread national concern with the characteristics of the tax. Disenchantment with the poll tax was many-faceted.\n16\n One of the basic objections to the poll tax was that it exacted a price for the privilege of exercising the franchise. Congressional hearings and debates indicate a general repugnance to the disenfranchisement of the poor occasioned by failure to pay the tax.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n \"While it is true that the amount of poll tax now required to be paid in the several States is small and imposes only a slight economical obstacle for any citizen who desires to qualify in order to vote, nevertheless, it is significant that the voting in poll tax States is relatively low as compared to the overall population which would be eligible. . . . [T]he historical analysis . . . indicates that where the poll tax has been abandoned . . . voter participation increased.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1821, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.\n\n\n Another objection to the poll tax raised in the congressional hearings was that the tax usually had to be paid long before the election - at a time when political campaigns were still quiescent - which tended to eliminate from the franchise a substantial number of voters who did \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 540]\n\u00a0\n not plan so far ahead.\n18\n The poll tax was also attacked as a vehicle for fraud which could be manipulated by political machines by financing block payments of the tax.\n19\n In addition, and of primary concern to many, the poll tax was viewed as a requirement adopted with an eye to the disenfranchisement of Negroes and applied in a discriminatory manner.\n20\n It is against this background that Congress proposed, and three-fourths of the States ratified, the Twenty-fourth Amendment abolishing the poll tax as a requirement for voting in federal elections.\n\nUpon adoption of the Amendment, of course, no State could condition the federal franchise upon payment of a poll tax. The State of Virginia accordingly removed the poll tax as an absolute prerequisite to qualification for voting in federal elections, but in its stead substituted a provision whereby the federal voter could qualify either by paying the customary poll tax or by filing a certificate of residence six months before the election.\n\nIt has long been established that a State may not impose a penalty upon those who exercise a right guaranteed by the Constitution. Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of California, \n271 \nU.S. 583\n. \"Constitutional rights would be of little value if they could be . . . indirectly denied,\" Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649, 664\n, or \"manipulated out of existence.\" Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339, 345\n. Significantly, the Twenty-fourth Amendment does not merely insure that the franchise shall not be \"denied\" by reason of failure to pay the poll tax; it expressly guarantees that the right to vote shall not be \"denied or abridged\" for that reason. Thus, like the Fifteenth Amendment, the Twenty-fourth \"nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes\" of impairing \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 541]\n\u00a0\n the right guaranteed. Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268, 275\n. \"It hits onerous procedural requirements which effectively handicap exercise of the franchise\" by those claiming the constitutional immunity. Ibid.; cf. Gray v. Johnson, 234 F. Supp. 743 (D.C. S. D. Miss.).\n\nThus in order to demonstrate the invalidity of 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code, it need only be shown that it imposes a material requirement solely upon those who refuse to surrender their constitutional right to vote in federal elections without paying a poll tax. Section 24-17.2 unquestionably erects a real obstacle to voting in federal elections for those who assert their constitutional exemption from the poll tax. As previously indicated, the requirement for those who wish to participate in federal elections without paying the poll tax is that they file in each election year, within a stated interval ending six months before the election, a notarized or witnessed certificate attesting that they have been continuous residents of the State since the date of registration (which might have been many years before under Virginia's system of permanent registration) and that they do not presently intend to leave the city or county in which they reside prior to the forthcoming election. Unlike the poll tax bill which is sent to the voter's residence, it is not entirely clear how one obtains the necessary certificate. The statutes merely provide for the distribution of the forms to city and county court clerks, and for further distribution to local registrars and election officials. Va. Code Ann. 24-28.1 (1964 Supp.). Construing the statutes in the manner least burdensome to the voter, it would seem that the voter could either obtain the certificate of residence from local election officials or prepare personally \"a certificate in form substantially\" as set forth in the statute. The certificate must then be filed \"in person, or otherwise\" with the city or county treasurer. This is plainly a cumbersome procedure. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 542]\n\u00a0\n In effect, it amounts to annual re-registration which Virginia officials have sharply contrasted with the \"simple\" poll tax system.\n21\n For many, it would probably seem far preferable to mail in the poll tax payment upon receipt of the bill. In addition, the certificate must be filed six months before the election, thus perpetuating one of the disenfranchising characteristics of the poll tax which the Twenty-fourth Amendment was designed to eliminate. We are thus constrained to hold that the requirement imposed upon the voter who refuses to pay the poll tax constitutes an abridgment of his right to vote by reason of failure to pay the poll tax.\n\nThe requirement imposed upon those who reject the poll tax method of qualifying would not be saved even if it could be said that it is no more onerous, or even somewhat less onerous, than the poll tax. For federal elections, the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed. Any material requirement imposed upon the federal voter solely because of his refusal to waive the constitutional immunity subverts the effectiveness of the Twenty-fourth Amendment and must fall under its ban.\n\nNor may the statutory scheme be saved, as the State asserts, on the ground that the certificate is a necessary substitute method of proving residence, serving the same function as the poll tax. As this Court has held in analogous situations, constitutional deprivations may not be justified by some remote administrative benefit to the State. Carrington v. Rash, ante, pp. 89. 96; Oyama \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 543]\n\u00a0\n v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 633, 646\n-647. Moreover, in this case the State has not demonstrated that the alternative requirement is in any sense necessary to the proper administration of its election laws. The forty-six States which do not require the payment of poll taxes have apparently found no great administrative burden in insuring that the electorate is limited to bona fide residents. The availability of numerous devices to enforce valid residence requirements - such as registration, use of the criminal sanction, purging of registration lists, challenges and oaths, public scrutiny by candidates and other interested parties - demonstrates quite clearly the lack of necessity for imposing a requirement whereby persons desiring to vote in federal elections must either pay a poll tax or file a certificate of residence six months prior to the election.\n\nThe Virginia poll tax was born of a desire to disenfranchise the Negro.\n22\n At the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, the sponsor of the suffrage plan of which the poll tax was an integral part frankly expressed the purpose of the suffrage proposal:\n\n\"Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose; that, exactly, is what this Convention was elected for - to discriminate to the very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The poll tax was later characterized by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals as a device limiting \"the right of suffrage to those who took sufficient interest in the affairs of the State to qualify themselves to vote.\" Campbell v. Goode, 172 Va. 463, 466, 2 S. E. 2d 456, 457. Whether, as the State contends, the payment of the poll tax is also a reliable indicium of continuing residence need not be decided, for even if the poll tax has served such an evidentiary function, the confrontation of the federal voter with a requirement that he either continue to pay the customary poll tax or file a certificate of residence could not be sustained. For federal elections the poll tax, regardless of the services it performs, was abolished by the Twenty-fourth Amendment. That Amendment was also designed to absolve all requirements impairing the right to vote in federal elections by reason of failure to pay the poll tax. Section 24-17.2 of the Virginia Code falls within this proscription.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN agrees with this opinion insofar as it rests on the proposition that the Twenty-fourth Amendment forbids the use of a state poll tax for any purpose whatever in determining voter qualifications in all elections for federal office. He also agrees that this is not a case for application of the abstention doctrine.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Va. Code Ann. 24-17.2 (1964 Supp.) provides: \"Proof of residence required; how furnished. - \"(a) No person shall be deemed to have the qualifications of residence required by 18 of the Constitution of Virginia and 24-17 and 24-27.1 in any calendar year subsequent to that in which he registered \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n under either 24-67 or 24-67.1, and shall not be entitled to vote in any election held in this State during any such subsequent calendar year, unless he has offered proof of continuing residence by filing in person, or otherwise, a certificate of residence at the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, or, at his option, by personally paying to the proper officer, at least six months prior to any such election in which he offers to vote, all State poll taxes assessed or assessable against him for the three years next preceding that in which he offers to vote. Proof of continuing residence may only be established by either of such two methods. \"(b) Any person who shall offer proof of continuing residence by filing a certificate of residence as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, shall file with the treasurer of his county or city not earlier than the first of October of the year next preceding that in which he offers to vote and not later than six months prior to the election, a certificate in form substantially as follows: \"I do certify that I am now and have been a resident of Virginia since the date of my registration to vote under the laws of Virginia, that I am now a resident of .......................

Va. Code Ann. 24-23.1 (1950).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Va. Code Ann. 24-52 - 24-119 (1950). Registration, effected by filing an application showing that the statutory requirements had been met ( 24-68), was permanent. Thereafter, in order to qualify for subsequent elections, the voter merely had to pay the assessed poll taxes (unless, of course, his name had been removed from the registration lists for, inter alia, failure to meet the statutory and constitutional requirements ( 24-94 - 24-96).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Va.

Acts, 1963 Extra Sess., c. 2, 1 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted and for failure to set forth a justiciable controversy was directed solely at the complaint of appellee Henderson, who was registered and had already paid his poll tax. The District Court was patently correct in rejecting the State's argument that appellee Henderson lacked standing to maintain this action. Gray v. Sanders, \n372 \nU.S. 368, 374\n-376; Baker v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186, 204\n-208.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., \n377 \nU.S. 324, 328\n-329; Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 375\n; England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411, 415\n-416.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] To the same effect, see England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411, 415\n-416; United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co., \n369 \nU.S. 134, 135\n-136; Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101, 105\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The only ambiguity discussed in the briefs of the parties or developed during argument concerned the question whether 24-17.2 required the voter to secure a prepared certificate of residence from local election officials or whether he could personally prepare one \"in form substantially\" as set forth in the statute. We do not regard this as a material ambiguity having any effect on the constitutional question and accept, for the purposes of this decision, the State's assertion that the voter may secure such a form from local election officials or prepare one according to the statutory description. Infra, p. 541.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The state also argues that since the States are empowered by Art. I, 2, Art. II, 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment to create voter qualifications for federal elections, the question whether a state statutory enactment creates a voter qualification must initially be referred to the state tribunals. True, \"[t]he States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised.\" Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections, \n360 \nU.S. 45, 50\n; Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621, 633\n; Mason v. Missouri, \n179 \nU.S. 328, 335\n. The right to vote, however, is constitutionally protected, Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 663\n-665; Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649, 664\n; and the conditions imposed by the States upon that right must not contravene \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n any constitutional provision or congressional restriction enacted pursuant to constitutional power. Carrington v. Rash, ante, p. 89, 91; Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections, \n360 \nU.S. 45, 50\n-51; United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 315\n. The question presented in this case - whether the Virginia statute imposes a condition upon the franchise which violates the United States Constitution - is thus quite clearly a federal question. The precise nature of the condition imposed is, of course, a question of Virginia law. However, the statutory requirement is clear and unambiguous, and the sole question remaining is whether the state requirement is valid under the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Va. Const., Art. II, 18, sets forth as a qualification for voting: residency in the State for one year, in the city or county six months, and in the voting precinct thirty days.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Moreover, the State cites no Virginia decisions in support of its contention that the requirement might constitute an impermissible \"qualification\" according to Virginia Law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Baggett v. Bullitt, \n377 \nU.S. 360, 378\n-379; England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411, 425\n-426 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The State also asserts that the District Court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties. The argument is that the relief requested in the complaints was an injunction against the enforcement of all provisions of the 1963 legislation, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 528, 538]\n\u00a0\n which included a system for separate registration of state and federal voters. Va. Code Ann. 24-67, 24-67.1 (1964 Supp.). Since registration in Virginia is entrusted to local registrars, the State argues, their joinder was essential in order to effect the relief requested. Williams v. Fanning, \n332 \nU.S. 490, 493\n-494. While the State is correct in asserting that the complaints were phrased broadly enough to encompass all portions of the 1963 Acts, the District Court was certainly warranted in concluding that the basic aim of the complaints was to secure relief from the certificate of residence requirement. The named defendants were clearly capable of effecting this relief and hence the District Court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss. Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, \n352 \nU.S. 599, 603\n-604. Moreover, even accepting the State's broad construction of the complaints, it is apparent that, given the State Board of Elections' power to supervise and to insure \"legality\" in the election process (Va. Code Ann. 24-25, 24-26, 24-27 (1950)), the local registrars were not indispensable parties. See Louisiana v. United States, ante, pp. 145, 151, n. 10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] H. R. Rep.

UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 6\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a grand jury witness, refused on self-incrimination grounds to answer certain questions. He and the grand jury were brought before the District Judge, who advised petitioner that he would receive immunity from prosecution and ordered him to answer the questions before the grand jury, but petitioner refused again. He was brought before the court again and sworn and once more refused to answer on the ground of privilege. The District Judge thereupon adjudged petitioner guilty of criminal contempt and imposed a prison sentence under Rule 42 (a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides for summary punishment for criminal contempt committed in the court's presence. Held:\n\n 1. Summary punishment of criminal contempt under Rule 42 (a) is reserved for such acts of misconduct in the court's presence as threatening the judge or obstructing court proceedings and other exceptional circumstances requiring prompt vindication of the court's dignity and authority. P. 164.\n\n\n 2. A refusal to testify, such as the one here, not involving a serious threat to orderly procedure is punishable only after notice and hearing as provided by Rule 42 (b). Brown v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 41\n, overruled. Pp. 164-167.\n\n\n 334 F.2d 460, reversed and remanded.\n\nRonald L. Goldfarb argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were E. David Rosen and Jacob Kossman.\n\nRalph S. Spritzer argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Marshall, Assistant Attorney General Vinson, Nathan Lewin, Beatrice Rosenberg and Sidney M. Glazer.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case brings back to us a question resolved by a closely divided Court in Brown v. United States, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 163]\n\u00a0\n \n359 \nU.S. 41\n, concerning the respective scope of Rule 42 (a) and of Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Petitioner was a witness before a grand jury and refused to answer certain questions on the ground of self-incrimination. He and the grand jury were brought before the District Court which directed him to answer the questions propounded before the grand jury, stating that petitioner would receive immunity from prosecution. He refused again to give any answers to the grand jury. He was thereupon brought before the District Court and sworn. The District Court repeated the questions and directed petitioner to answer, but he refused on the ground of privilege. The prosecution at once requested that petitioner be found in contempt of court \"under Rule 42 (a).\" Counsel for petitioner protested and requested an adjournment and a public hearing where he would be permitted to call witnesses. The District Court denied the motion and thereupon adjudged petitioner guilty of criminal contempt, imposing a sentence of one year's imprisonment.\n1\n The Court of Appeals \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n affirmed, 334 F.2d 460. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 944\n.\n\nRule 42 (a) is entitled \"Summary Disposition\" and reads as follows:\n\n \"A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certified that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.\"\n\n\n Rule 42 (a) was reserved \"for exceptional circumstances,\" Brown v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 41, 54\n (dissenting opinion), such as acts threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing or obstructing court proceedings. Ibid. We reach that conclusion in light of \"the concern long demonstrated by both Congress and this Court over the possible abuse of the contempt power,\" ibid., and in light of the wording of the Rule. Summary contempt is for \"misbehavior\" (Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 314\n) in the \"actual presence of the court.\" Then speedy punishment may be necessary in order to achieve \"summary vindication of the court's dignity and authority.\" Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 534\n. But swiftness was not a prerequisite of justice here. Delay necessary for a hearing would not imperil the grand jury proceedings.\n\nCases of the kind involved here are foreign to Rule 42 (a). The real contempt, if such there was, was contempt before the grand jury - the refusal to answer to it when directed by the court. Swearing the witness and repeating the questions before the judge was an effort to have the refusal to testify \"committed in the actual presence of the court\" for the purposes of Rule \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n 42 (a). It served no other purpose, for the witness had been adamant and had made his position known. The appearance before the District Court was not a new and different proceeding, unrelated to the other. It was ancillary to the grand jury hearing and designed as an aid to it. Even though we assume arguendo that Rule 42 (a) may at times reach testimonial episodes, nothing in this case indicates that petitioner's refusal was such an open, serious threat to orderly procedure that instant and summary punishment, as distinguished from due and deliberate procedures (Cooke v. United States, supra, at 536), was necessary. Summary procedure, to use the words of Chief Justice Taft, was designed to fill \"the need for immediate penal vindication of the dignity of the court.\" Ibid. We start from the premise long ago stated in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231, that the limits of the power to punish for contempt are \"[t]he least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\"\n2\n In the instant case, the dignity of the court was not being affronted: no disturbance had to be quelled; no insolent tactics had to be stopped. The contempt here committed was far outside the narrow category envisioned by Rule 42 (a).\n3\n\u00a0\n\nRule 42 (b) provides the normal procedure. It reads:\n\n \"A criminal contempt except as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule shall be prosecuted on notice. The notice shall state the time and place of hearing, allowing a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense, and shall state the essential facts \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n constituting the criminal contempt charged and describe it as such. The notice shall be given orally by the judge in open court in the presence of the defendant or, on application of the United States attorney or of an attorney appointed by the court for that purpose, by an order to show cause or an order of arrest. The defendant is entitled to a trial by jury in any case in which an act of Congress so provides. He is entitled to admission to bail as provided in these rules. If the contempt charged involves disrespect to or criticism of a judge, that judge is disqualified from presiding at the trial or hearing except with the defendant's consent. Upon a verdict or finding of guilt the court shall enter an order fixing the punishment.\"\n\n\n Such notice and hearing serve important ends. What appears to be a brazen refusal to cooperate with the grand jury may indeed be a case of frightened silence. Refusal to answer may be due to fear - fear of reprisals on the witness or his family. Other extenuating circumstances may be present.\n4\n We do not suggest that there were circumstances of that nature here. We are wholly ignorant of the episode except for what the record shows and it reveals only the barebones of demand and refusal. If justice is to be done, a sentencing judge should know all the facts. We can imagine situations where the questions are so inconsequential to the grand jury but the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 167]\n\u00a0\n fear of reprisal so great that only nominal punishment, if any, is indicated. Our point is that a hearing and only a hearing will elucidate all the facts and assure a fair administration of justice. Then courts will not act on surmise or suspicion but will come to the sentencing stage of the proceeding with insight and understanding.\n\nWe are concerned solely with \"procedural regularity\" which, as Mr. Justice Brandies said in Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465, 477\n (dissenting), has been \"a large factor\" in the development of our liberty. Rule 42 (b) prescribes the \"procedural regularity\" for all contempts in the federal regime\n5\n except those unusual situations envisioned by Rule 42 (a) where instant action is necessary to protect the judicial institution itself.\n\nWe overrule Brown v. United States, supra, and reverse and remand this case for proceedings under Rule 42 (b).\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The Court: Anything further?\n\n\"Mr. Maloney: No, your Honor.\n\n\n\"I think the record speaks for itself, and I would ask your Honor to find this witness in contempt of court under Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n\n\"Mr. Polakoff: Your Honor, if this is a contempt proceeding I respectfully request an adjournment.

United States, \n350 \nU.S. 399, 404\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 42 (a) was described by the Advisory Committee as \"substantially a restatement of existing law. Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289\n; Cooke v. United States . . . .\" We have confirmed this on more than one occasion, e. g., Offutt v. United States. \n348 \nU.S. 11, 13\n-14; Brown v. United States, supra, at 51.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Chief Justice Taft said in Cooke v. United States, supra, at 537:\n\n\"Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F.2d 883; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F.2d 548; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F.2d 290; United States v. Pappadio, 346 F.2d 5. There is no indication that this procedure impeded the functioning of the grand jury.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.\n\nThe issue in this case is the procedure to be followed when a witness has refused to answer questions before a grand jury after he has been ordered to do so by a district court. This issue, involving Rule 42 (a) and Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, was, as the Court says, resolved in Brown v. United States, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 168]\n\u00a0\n \n359 \nU.S. 41\n.\n1\n That was six years ago. Since then this Court has made no changes in Rule 42 (a) or 42 (b).\n2\n But today Brown is overturned, and the question it \"resolved\" is now answered in the opposite way.\n\nThe particular question at issue here is of limited importance. But in this area the Court's duty is important, involving as it does the responsibility for clear and consistent guidance to the federal judiciary in the application of ground rules of our own making. We are not faithful to that duty, I think, when we overturn a settled construction of those rules for no better reasons than those the Court has offered in this case.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe limited scope of the question at issue is made clear by the present record. A grand jury in the Southern District of New York was investigating alleged violations of the Communications Act of 1934.\n4\n The petitioner appeared before this grand jury pursuant to a subpoena. He refused to answer a number of questions about an interstate telephone call upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. The petitioner was then \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 169]\n\u00a0\n granted immunity from any possible self-incrimination under 409 (1) of the Communications Act.\n5\n Only after giving the petitioner and his lawyer full opportunity to be heard did the District Judge rule that the petitioner was clothed with complete constitutional immunity from self-incrimination, and only then did he direct the petitioner to answer the grand jury's questions. The petitioner returned to the grand jury room and again refused to answer the questions, this time in direct and deliberate disobedience of the District Judge's order.\n\nIt is common ground, I suppose, that the petitioner was then and there in contempt of court.\n6\n Since the petitioner's refusal to obey the judge's order did not occur within the sight and hearing of the judge, a contempt proceeding could then have been initiated only under Rule 42 (b). Such a proceeding would have been fully consonant with our decision in Brown,\n7\n and a judge \"more intent upon punishing the witness than aiding the grand jury in its investigation might well have taken just such a course.\" \n359 \nU.S., at 50\n. In such a proceeding all that would have been required to prove the contempt \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 170]\n\u00a0\n would have been the testimony of the grand jury stenographer, and the judge could then have imposed sentence. Such a procedure is often followed.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nInstead, however, the District Judge in this case followed the alternative procedure approved in Brown. He made one last effort to aid the grand jury in its investigation and gave the petitioner a final chance to purge himself of contempt. The petitioner and his lawyer appeared before the judge in open court.\n9\n After the petitioner was sworn as a witness, the judge propounded the same questions which the petitioner had refused to answer before the grand jury. The petitioner again refused to answer. At the conclusion of the questioning the judge asked, \"Does anybody want to say anything further?\" The only response from the petitioner's counsel, then or later,\n10\n was a brief renewal of his attack upon the purpose of the grand jury investigation and the scope of the immunity which had been conferred upon the petitioner - legal questions which the judge had, after a complete hearing, fully determined before he had ordered the petitioner to answer the grand jury's questions in the first place.\n\nThe procedure followed by the District Court in this case was in precise conformity with Rule 42 (a) and with \n\n[382 \nU.S. 162, 171]\n\u00a0\n long-settled and consistently followed practice.\n11\n It is a procedure which, in this context, is at least as fair as a Rule 42 (b) proceeding. The petitioner, represented by counsel, was accorded an additional chance to purge himself of contempt; he and his counsel were accorded full opportunity to offer any explanation they might have had in extenuation of the contempt - to inform the \"sentencing judge of all the facts.\" And finally, there is no reason to assume that a sentence imposed for obduracy before a grand jury is likely to be more severe in a Rule 42 (a) proceeding than one imposed after a proceeding under Rule 42 (b). Indeed, the recent Rule 42 (b) cases in the Southern District of New York referred to by the Court indicate the contrary.\n12\n A sentence for contempt is reviewable on appeal in either case,\n13\n and there is nothing to suggest that in the exercise of this reviewing power an appellate court will have any more information to go on in the one case than in the other.\n\nFor these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Brown v. United States was reaffirmed and followed in Levine v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 610\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The proposed amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts, approved on September 22-23, 1965, by the Judicial Conference of the United States, make no changes in Rule 42 (a) or Rule 42 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] No argumentation or factual data are contained in the Court's opinion today which were not fully revealed in the dissenting opinion in Brown, \n359 \nU.S., at 53\n-63, passim, and considered by the Court there. Nor is it suggested that the Brown rule has proved to be unclear or difficult of application. The considerations attending the overruling of Brown are quite unlike those involved in the overruling that occurred in Swift & Co., Inc. v. Wickham, ante, p. 111, where the Court changed a procedural rule which it found unworkable in actual practice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 48 Stat. 1070 and 1100, 47 U.S.C. 203 (c) and 501 (1964 ed.), and 18 U.S.C. 1952 (1964 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 48 Stat. 1096, 47 U.S.C. 409 (l) (1964 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The prevailing opinion today says, \"The real contempt, if such there was, was contempt before the grand jury . . . .\" But a grand jury is without power itself to compel the testimony of witnesses. It is the court's process which summons the witness to attend and give testimony, and it is the court which must compel a witness to testify, if, after appearing, he refuses to do so.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"When upon his return to the grand jury room the petitioner again refused to answer the grand jury's questions, now in direct disobedience of the court's order, he was for the first time guilty of contempt. At that point a contempt proceeding could unquestionably and quite properly have been initiated. Since this disobedience of the order did not take place in the actual presence of the court, and thus could be made known to the court only by the taking of evidence, the proceeding would have been conducted upon notice and hearing in conformity with Rule 42 (b). See Carlson v. United States, 209 F.2d 209, 216 (C. A. 1st Cir.).\" \n359 \nU.S., at 50\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See cases cited in note 5 of the Court's opinion, ante, p. 167.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The record shows that the court was \"opened by proclamation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Before imposing sentence, the judge gave petitioner and his counsel still another opportunity to offer any explanation they might have of the petitioner's obduracy:\n\n\"The Court: I have already made my position perfectly clear, but I will say it again: I have directed you to answer these questions before the grand jury, and I have directed you to answer them here. It is my ruling that you cannot be prosecuted for any answer that you give under the circumstances of this case.

Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., \n270 \nU.S. 390\n, followed. Pp. 254-256.\n\n 119 U.S. App. D.C. 261, 340 F.2d 786, affirmed.\n\nLaurence B. Dodds argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was George R. Jones.\n\nJ. William Doolittle argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were Solicitor General Marshall, Assistant Attorney General Douglas and Lawrence R. Schneider.\n\nIrwin M. Aisenberg filed a brief, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe sole question presented here is whether an application for patent pending in the Patent Office at the time a second application is filed constitutes part of the \"prior art\" as that term is used in 35 U.S.C. 103 (1964 ed.). which reads in part:\n\n \"A patent may not be obtained . . . if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art . . . .\"\n\n\n The question arose in this way. On December 23, 1957, petitioner Robert Regis filed an application for a \n\n[382 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n patent on a new and useful improvement on a microwave switch. On June 24, 1959, the Patent Examiner denied Regis' application on the ground that the invention was not one which was new or unobvious in light of the prior art and thus did not meet the standards set forth in 103. The Examiner said that the invention was unpatentable because of the joint effect of the disclosures made by patents previously issued, one to Carlson (No. 2,491,644) and one to Wallace (No. 2,822,526). The Carlson patent had been issued on December 20, 1949, over eight years prior to Regis' application, and that patent is admittedly a part of the prior art insofar as Regis' invention is concerned. The Wallace patent, however, was pending in the Patent Office when the Regis application was filed. The Wallace application had been pending since March 24, 1954, nearly three years and nine months before Regis filed his application and the Wallace patent was issued on February 4, 1958, 43 days after Regis filed his application.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nAfter the Patent Examiner refused to issue the patent, Regis appealed to the Patent Office Board of Appeals on the ground that the Wallace patent could not be properly considered a part of the prior art because it had been a \"co-pending patent\" and its disclosures were secret and not known to the public. The Board of Appeals rejected this argument and affirmed the decision of the Patent Examiner. Regis and Hazeltine, which had an interest as assignee, then instituted the present action in the District Court pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 145 (1964 ed.) to compel the Commissioner to issue the patent. The District Court agreed with the Patent Office that the co-pending Wallace application was a part of the prior art \n\n[382 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n and directed that the complaint be dismissed. 226 F. Supp. 459. On appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed per curiam. 119 U.S. App. D.C. 261, 340 F.2d 786. We granted certiorari to decide the question of whether a co-pending application is included in the prior art, as that term is used in 35 U.S.C. 103. \n380 \nU.S. 960\n.\n\nPetitioners' primary contention is that the term \"prior art,\" as used in 103, really means only art previously publicly known. In support of this position they refer to a statement in the legislative history which indicates that prior art means \"what was known before as described in section 102.\"\n2\n They contend that the use of the word \"known\" indicates that Congress intended prior art to include only inventions or discoveries which were already publicly known at the time an invention was made.\n\nIf petitioners are correct in their interpretation of \"prior art,\" then the Wallace invention, which was not publicly known at the time the Regis application was filed, would not be prior art with regard to Regis' invention. This is true because at the time Regis filed his application the Wallace invention, although pending in the Patent Office, had never been made public and the Patent Office was forbidden by statute from disclosing to the public, except in special circumstances, anything contained in the application.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commissioner, relying chiefly on Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., \n270 \nU.S. 390\n, contends that when a patent is issued, the disclosures contained in the patent become a part of the prior art as \n\n[382 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n of the time the application was filed, not, as petitioners contend, at the time the patent is issued. In that case a patent was held invalid because, at the time it was applied for, there was already pending an application which completely and adequately described the invention. In holding that the issuance of a patent based on the first application barred the valid issuance of a patent based on the second application, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, said, \"The delays of the patent office ought not to cut down the effect of what has been done. . . . [The first applicant] had taken steps that would make it public as soon as the Patent Office did its work, although, of course, amendments might be required of him before the end could be reached. We see no reason in the words or policy of the law for allowing [the second applicant] to profit by the delay . . . .\" At p. 401.\n\nIn its revision of the patent laws in 1952, Congress showed its approval of the holding in Milburn by adopting 35 U.S.C. 102 (e) (1964 ed.) which provides that a person shall be entitled to a patent unless \"(e) the invention was described in a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.\" Petitioners suggest, however, that the question in this case is not answered by mere reference to 102 (e), because in Milburn, which gave rise to that section, the co-pending applications described the same identical invention. But here the Regis invention is not precisely the same as that contained in the Wallace patent, but is only made obvious by the Wallace patent in light of the Carlson patent. We agree with the Commissioner that this distinction is without significance here. While we think petitioners' argument with regard to 102 (e) is interesting, it provides no reason to depart from the plain holding and reasoning in the Milburn case. The basic reasoning \n\n[382 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n upon which the Court decided the Milburn case applies equally well here. When Wallace filed his application, he had done what he could to add his disclosures to the prior art. The rest was up to the Patent Office. Had the Patent Office acted faster, had it issued Wallace's patent two months earlier, there would have been no question here. As Justice Holmes said in Milburn, \"The delays of the patent office ought not to cut down the effect of what has been done.\" P. 401.\n\nTo adopt the result contended for by petitioners would create an area where patents are awarded for unpatentable advances in the art. We see no reason to read into 103 a restricted definition of \"prior art\" which would lower standards of patentability to such an extent that there might exist two patents where the Congress has plainly directed that there should be only one.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is not disputed that Regis' alleged invention, as well as his application, was made after Wallace's application was filed. There is, therefore, no question of priority of invention before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] H. R. Rep.

MISSISSIPPI(1965)\nNo. 6\nArgued: October 13, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The Mississippi Supreme Court, reviewing petitioner's appeal from a conviction for disturbing the peace, first filed an opinion which reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that petitioner's wife's consent to a search of his automobile did not waive his rights and, in the belief that petitioner had out-of-state counsel unfamiliar with local practice, reversed in spite of petitioner's failure to comply with the state requirement of contemporaneous objection to the introduction of illegal evidence. The court noted that petitioner moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State's case, assigning as one ground the use of the illegal evidence. After the State filed a Suggestion of Error, pointing out that petitioner was represented by local as well as out-of-state counsel, the court substituted another opinion, affirming the conviction and holding that mistakes of counsel, even if honest, are binding on the client. Held: The question whether the nonfederal procedural ground (the contemporaneous-objection requirement) is adequate to bar review - that is, whether its imposition in this case serves a legitimate state interest - is not decided, for the record indicates, but is insufficient to establish, that petitioner, personally or through counsel, may have knowingly forgone his opportunity to raise his federal claims. Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391, 439\n. The interests of sound judicial administration call for a remand to permit the State to establish whether or not there was a waiver. This may avoid the necessity for a decision by this Court on the adequacy of the state procedural ground, and it permits the State to determine the waiver question, which would otherwise be open on federal habeas corpus, even if the state ground were adequate. Pp. 449-453.\n\n 154 So.2d 289, reversed and remanded.\n\nBarbara A. Morris argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were Robert L. Carter, Jack H. Young, R. Jess Brown, Jr., and Alvin K. Hellerstein. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n\n\nG. Garland Lyell, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of Mississippi, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Joe T. Patterson, Attorney General of Mississippi.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was convicted of disturbing the peace, by indecent proposals to and offensive contact with an 18-year-old hitchhiker to whom he is said to have given a ride in his car. The trial judge charged the jury that \"you cannot find the defendant guilty on the unsupported and uncorroborated testimony of the complainant alone.\" The petitioner's federal claim derives from the admission of a police officer's testimony, introduced to corroborate the hitchhiker's testimony. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that the officer's testimony was improperly admitted as the fruit of \"an unlawful search and was in violation of 23, Miss. Constitution 1890.\" 154 So.2d 289, 294.\n1\n The tainted evidence tended to substantiate the hitchhiker's testimony by showing its accuracy in a detail which could have been seen only by one inside the car. In particular, it showed that the right-hand ashtray of the car in which the incident took place was full of Dentyne chewing gum wrappers, and that the cigarette lighter did not function. The police officer testified that after petitioner's arrest he had returned to the petitioner's home and obtained the permission of petitioner's \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n wife to look in petitioner's car. The wife provided the officer with the keys, with which the officer opened the car. He testified that he tried the lighter and it would not work, and also that the ashtray \"was filled with red dentyne chewing gum wrappers.\"\n\nThe Mississippi Supreme Court first filed an opinion which reversed petitioner's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the wife's consent to the search of the car did not waive petitioner's constitutional rights, and noted that the \"[t]estimony of the State's witness . . . is, in effect, uncorroborated without the evidence disclosed by the inspection of defendant's automobile.\" 154 So.2d, at 296 (advance sheet).\n2\n Acting in the belief that petitioner had been represented by nonresident counsel unfamiliar with local procedure, the court reversed despite petitioner's failure to comply with the Mississippi requirement that an objection to illegal evidence be made at the time it is introduced. The court noted that petitioner had moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State's case, assigning as one ground the use of illegally obtained evidence; it did not mention petitioner's renewal of his motion at the close of all evidence.\n\nAfter the first opinion was handed down, the State filed a Suggestion of Error, pointing out that petitioner was in fact represented at his trial by competent local counsel, as well as by out-of-state lawyers. Thereupon the Mississippi Supreme Court withdrew its first opinion and filed a new opinion in support of a judgment \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n affirming petitioner's conviction. The new opinion is identical with the first save for the result, the statement that petitioner had local counsel, and the discussion of the effect of failure for whatever reason to make timely objection to the evidence. \"In such circumstances, even if honest mistakes of counsel in respect to policy or strategy or otherwise occur, they are binding upon the client as a part of the hazards of courtroom battle.\" 154 So.2d, at 296 (bound volume). Moreover, the court reasoned, petitioner's cross-examination of the State's witness before the initial motion for directed verdict, and introduction of other evidence of the car's interior appearance afterward, \"cured\" the original error and estopped petitioner from complaining of the tainted evidence. We granted certiorari, \n376 \nU.S. 904\n. We vacate the judgment of conviction and remand for a hearing on the question whether the petitioner is to be deemed to have knowingly waived decision of his federal claim when timely objection was not made to the admission of the illegally seized evidence.\n\nIt is, of course, a familiar principle that this Court will decline to review state court judgments which rest on independent and adequate state grounds, even where those judgments also decide federal questions. The principle applies not only in cases involving state substantive grounds, Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, but also in cases involving state procedural grounds. Compare Herb v. Pitcairn, \n324 \nU.S. 117, 125\n-126, with Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22\n. But it is important to distinguish between state substantive grounds and state procedural grounds. Where the ground involved is substantive, the determination of the federal question cannot affect the disposition if the state court decision on the state law question is allowed to stand. Under the view taken in Murdock of the statutes conferring appellate jurisdiction \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n on this Court, we have no power to revise judgments on questions of state law. Thus, the adequate nonfederal ground doctrine is necessary to avoid advisory opinions.\n\nThese justifications have no application where the state ground is purely procedural. A procedural default which is held to bar challenge to a conviction in state courts, even on federal constitutional grounds, prevents implementation of the federal right. Accordingly, we have consistently held that the question of when and how defaults in compliance with state procedural rules can preclude our consideration of a federal question is itself a federal question. Cf. Lovell v. City of Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 450\n. As Mr. Justice Holmes said:\n\n \"When as here there is a plain assertion of federal rights in the lower court, local rules as to how far it shall be reviewed on appeal do not necessarily prevail. . . . Whether the right was denied or not given due recognition by the [state court] . . . is a question as to which the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke our judgment.\" Love v. Griffith, \n266 \nU.S. 32, 33\n-34.\n\n\n Only last Term, we reaffirmed this principle, holding that a state appellate court's refusal, on the ground of mootness, to consider a federal claim, did not preclude our independent determination of the question of mootness; that is itself a question of federal law which this Court must ultimately decide. Liner v. Jafco, Inc., \n375 \nU.S. 301\n. These cases settle the proposition that a litigant's procedural defaults in state proceedings do not prevent vindication of his federal rights unless the State's insistence on compliance with its procedural rule serves a legitimate state interest. In every case we must inquire whether the enforcement of a procedural forfeiture serves such a state interest. If it does not, the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 448]\n\u00a0\n state procedural rule ought not be permitted to bar vindication of important federal rights.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Mississippi rule requiring contemporaneous objection to the introduction of illegal evidence clearly does serve a legitimate state interest. By immediately apprising the trial judge of the objection, counsel gives the court the opportunity to conduct the trial without using the tainted evidence. If the objection is well taken the fruits of the illegal search may be excluded from jury consideration, and a reversal and new trial avoided. But on the record before us it appears that this purpose of the contemporaneous-objection rule may have been substantially served by petitioner's motion at the close of the State's evidence asking for a directed verdict because of the erroneous admission of the officer's testimony. For at this stage the trial judge could have called for elaboration of the search and seizure argument and, if persuaded, could have stricken the tainted testimony or have taken other appropriate corrective action. For example, if there was sufficient competent evidence without this testimony to go to the jury, the motion for a directed verdict might have been denied, and the case submitted to the jury with a properly worded appropriate cautionary instruction.\n4\n In these circumstances, the delay until the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n close of the State's case in presenting the objection cannot be said to have frustrated the State's interest in avoiding delay and waste of time in the disposition of the case. If this is so, and enforcement of the rule here would serve no substantial state interest, then settled principles would preclude treating the state ground as adequate; giving effect to the contemporaneous-objection rule for its own sake \"would be to force resort to an arid ritual of meaningless form.\" Staub v. City of Baxley, \n335 \nU.S. 313, 320\n; see also Wright v. Georgia, \n373 \nU.S. 284, 289\n-291.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWe have no reason, however, to decide that question now or to express any view on the merits of petitioner's substantial constitutional claim.\n6\n For even assuming \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 450]\n\u00a0\n that the making of the objection on the motion for a directed verdict satisfied the state interest served by the contemporaneous-objection rule, the record suggests a possibility that petitioner's counsel deliberately bypassed the opportunity to make timely objection in the state court, and thus that the petitioner should be deemed to have forfeited his state court remedies. Although the Mississippi Supreme Court characterized the failure to object as an \"honest mistake,\" 154 So.2d, at 296 (bound volume), the State, in the brief in support of its Suggestion of Error in the Supreme Court of Mississippi asserted its willingness to agree that its Suggestion of Error \"should not be sustained if either of the three counsel [for petitioner] participating in this trial would respond hereto with an affidavit that he did not know that at some point in a trial in criminal court in Mississippi that an objection to such testimony must have been made.\" The second opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court does not refer to the State's proposal and thus it appears that the Court did not believe that the issue was properly presented for decision. Another indication of possible waiver appears in an affidavit attached to the State's brief in this Court; there, the respondent asserted that one of petitioner's lawyers stood up as if to object to the officer's tainted testimony, and was pulled down by co-counsel. Again, this furnishes an insufficient basis for decision of the waiver questions at this time. But, together with the proposal in the Suggestion of Error, it is enough to justify an evidentiary hearing to determine whether petitioner \"after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures . . . .\" Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391, 439\n. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 451]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe evidence suggests reasons for a strategic move. Both the complaining witness and the police officer testified that the cigarette lighter in the car did not work. After denial of its motion for a directed verdict the defense called a mechanic who had repaired the cigarette lighter. The defense might have planned to allow the complaining witness and the officer to testify that the cigarette lighter did not work, and then, if the motion for directed verdict were not granted, to discredit both witnesses by showing that it did work, thereby persuading the jury to acquit. Or, by delaying objection to the evidence, the defense might have hoped to invite error and lay the foundation for a subsequent reversal. If either reason motivated the action of petitioner's counsel, and their plans backfired, counsel's deliberate choice of the strategy would amount to a waiver binding on petitioner and would preclude him from a decision on the merits of his federal claim either in the state courts or here.\n7\n Although trial strategy adopted by counsel without prior consultation with an accused will not, where the circumstances are exceptional, preclude the accused from asserting constitutional claims, see Whitus v. Balkcom, 333 F.2d 496 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1964), we think that the deliberate bypassing by counsel of the contemporaneous-objection \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 452]\n\u00a0\n rule as a part of trial strategy would have that effect in this case.\n\nOnly evidence extrinsic to the record before us can establish the fact of waiver, and the State should have an opportunity to establish that fact. In comparable cases arising in federal courts we have vacated the judgments of conviction and remanded for a hearing, suspending the determination of the validity of the conviction pending the outcome of the hearing. See United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., \n355 \nU.S. 233\n; Campbell v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 85\n. We recently adopted a similar procedure to determine an issue essential to the fairness of a state conviction. See Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368, 393\n-394; Boles v. Stevenson, \n379 \nU.S. 43\n. We think a similar course is particularly desirable here, since a dismissal on the basis of an adequate state ground would not end this case; petitioner might still pursue vindication of his federal claim in a federal habeas corpus proceeding in which the procedural default will not alone preclude consideration of his claim, at least unless it is shown that petitioner deliberately bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts. Fay v. Noia, supra, at 438.\n\nOf course, in so remanding we neither hold nor even remotely imply that the State must forgo insistence on its procedural requirements if it finds no waiver. Such a finding would only mean that petitioner could have a federal court apply settled principles to test the effectiveness of the procedural default to foreclose consideration of his constitutional claim. If it finds the procedural default ineffective, the federal court will itself decide the merits of his federal claim, at least so long as the state court does not wish to do so. By permitting the Mississippi courts to make an initial determination of waiver, we serve the causes of efficient administration of criminal justice, and of harmonious federal-state judicial relations. Such a disposition may make unnecessary the processing \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 453]\n\u00a0\n of the case through federal courts already laboring under congested dockets,\n8\n or it may make unnecessary the relitigation in a federal forum of certain issues. See Townsend v. Sain, \n372 \nU.S. 293, 312\n-319. The Court is not blind to the fact that the federal habeas corpus jurisdiction has been a source of irritation between the federal and state judiciaries. It has been suggested that this friction might be ameliorated if the States would look upon our decisions in Fay v. Noia, supra, and Townsend v. Sain, supra, as affording them an opportunity to provide state procedures, direct or collateral, for a full airing of federal claims.\n9\n That prospect is better served by a remand than by relegating petitioner to his federal habeas remedy. Therefore, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Mississippi Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Mississippi Supreme Court wrote two opinions. The first is reported in the July 11, 1963, issue of the Southern Reporter advance sheets, 154 So.2d 289. This was withdrawn when the court filed the second opinion, which appears at the same page in the bound volume of the Southern Reporter. Citations hereinafter will designate the bound volume or the advance sheet if the cited material appears in only one opinion. The material referred to at this point in the text appears in both opinions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The complaining witness also testified as to the last four digits of petitioner's license plate, and to the fact that the first three digits were obscured; these facts were independently substantiated. Since the license plate could be seen from outside the car, and petitioner denied that the complaining witness had ever been in his car, the Mississippi Supreme Court apparently accepted the officer's testimony concerning the Dentyne wrappers and cigarette lighter as the only cogent corroborative evidence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This will not lead inevitably to a plethora of attacks on the application of state procedural rules; where the state rule is a reasonable one and clearly announced to defendant and counsel, application of the waiver doctrine will yield the same result as that of the adequate nonfederal ground doctrine in the vast majority of cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The view of the Mississippi court in its first opinion seems to have been that there was insufficient evidence apart from the tainted testimony to support the conviction. Hence, appropriate corrective action as a matter of state law might have included granting petitioner's motion. We have not overlooked the fact that the first opinion remanded for a new trial, although the usual practice of the Mississippi Supreme Court where a motion for directed verdict, renewed at the close of all the evidence, is improperly denied is to \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 449]\n\u00a0\n dismiss the prosecution. See Lewis v. State, 198 Miss. 767, 23 So.2d 401; Adams v. State, 202 Miss. 68, 30 So.2d 593; Smith v. State, 205 Miss. 170, 38 So.2d 698. The opinion offers no explanation of the mandate; the answer is probably that the court refers only to the motion at the end of the State's case, 154 So.2d, at 294, 295, and overlooks the fact that it was renewed at the close of all the evidence, just as it overlooks the presence of local counsel. If the motion were not renewed, the appellate court could not dismiss the prosecution. See Smith v. State, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] We do not rely on the principle that our review is not precluded when the state court has failed to exercise discretion to disregard the procedural default. See Williams v. Georgia, \n349 \nU.S. 375\n. We read the second Mississippi Supreme Court opinion as holding that there is no such discretion where it appears that petitioner was represented by competent local counsel familiar with local procedure.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Thus, consistently with the policy of avoiding premature decision on the merits of constitutional questions, we intimate no view whether the pertinent controlling federal standard governing the legality of a search or seizure, see Ker v. California, \n374 \nU.S. 23\n, is the same as the Mississippi standard applied here, which holds that the wife's consent cannot validate a search as against her husband. Nor do we rule at this time on the question whether petitioner's cross-examination of the officer, before raising any objection, \"cured\" the effect of the inadmissible testimony; this Court has not yet ruled on the role of harmless error in search and seizure cases. Cf. Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368, 376\n. Of course, nothing occurring after the judge's refusal to honor petitioner's objection could have this curative effect.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The state court's holding that petitioner was estopped because his counsel brought up the question of the car's interior appearance on direct examination and cross-examination, see p. 446, supra, amounts to a holding that petitioner waived his federal right. In the absence of a showing that this was prompted by litigation strategy, the present record is insufficient to support such a holding. The cross-examination during the State's case, amounting to little more than a half-page in the printed record, adds little to petitioner's failure to make contemporaneous objection. The evidence brought in on direct examination was only after petitioner had moved for a directed verdict, pointing to the illegal evidence. This would scarcely support a finding of waiver.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners in federal district courts increased from 1,903 to 3,531, or 85.5%, from the 1963 to the 1964 fiscal year. Annual Report of the Director, Administrative Office of the United States Courts, p. 46 (1964); our own Miscellaneous Docket, where cases of state prisoners are primarily listed, continues to show substantial increases. The number has increased from 878 for the 1956 Term to 1,532 for the 1963 Term.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Meador, Accommodating State Criminal Procedure and Federal Postconviction Review, 50 A. B. A. J. 928 (October 1964). And see Brennan, Some Aspects of Federalism, 39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 945, 957-959 (1964).\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nPetitioner contends that his conviction was based in part on evidence obtained by an allegedly unlawful search in violation of the United States Constitution. I would decide this federal question here and now. I do not believe that the Mississippi procedural trial rule relied on by the State can shut off this Court's review, nor do I find a particle of support for the Court's suggestion that \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 454]\n\u00a0\n petitioner knowingly waived his right to have this constitutional question decided by the state trial court.\n\nAs far as the issue of waiver is concerned, I agree with the Mississippi Supreme Court, which considered the failure to object one of the \"honest mistakes\" which any lawyer might make,\n1\n since I believe that the record is completely barren of evidence to support a finding of a conscious and intentional waiver of petitioner's due process right to have the trial court decide whether evidence used against him had been unconstitutionally seized. Therefore I would not remand for a hearing by the State Supreme Court or the trial court on the issue of waiver.\n2\n And even if I considered that a real issue of waiver had been shown and was properly before us, I would decide it here. I cannot agree to the Court's judgment remanding the case to the state courts for a hearing on that issue alone, thereby giving the State a chance to supplement the trial record to save its conviction from constitutional challenge in a summary hearing before a court without a jury. This is the kind of piecemeal prosecution invented and used by this Court several years ago in United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., \n355 \nU.S. 233\n. I expressed my dissent from such an unjust, if not unconstitutional, fragmentizing technique in Shotwell, \n355 \nU.S., at 246\n-252, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 455]\n\u00a0\n and again last year when the Court again applied it in Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368\n, dissenting opinion at 401, 409-410. See also Boles v. Stevenson, \n379 \nU.S. 43\n, dissent noted at 46. I have the same objections to \"Shotwelling\" the present case. And I do not think this dangerous Shotwelling device should be expanded so that the State may invoke it merely by challenging petitioner's counsel here to deny knowledge of Mississippi's procedural rule.\n\nNor do I believe that Mississippi's procedural rule concerning the stage of a trial at which constitutional objections should be made is the kind of rule that we should accept as an independent, adequate ground for the State Supreme Court's refusal to decide the constitutional question raised by petitioner. In Williams v. Georgia, \n349 \nU.S. 375\n, this Court held that where a State allows constitutional questions \"to be raised at a late stage and be determined by its courts as a matter of discretion, we are not concluded from assuming jurisdiction and deciding whether the state court action in the particular circumstances is, in effect, an avoidance of the federal right.\"\n3\n No Mississippi court opinions or state statutes have been called to our attention that I read as denying power of the State Supreme Court, should that court wish to do so, to consider and determine constitutional questions presented at the time this one was. In fact, as I understand counsel for the State, the Supreme Court of Mississippi does have power in its discretion to consider such questions regardless of when they are presented.\n4\n As that court has said most persuasively:\n\n\"Constitutional rights in serious criminal cases rise above mere rules of procedure. . . . Errors affecting \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 456]\n\u00a0\n fundamental rights are exceptions to the rule that questions not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\" Brooks v. State, 209 Miss. 150, 155, 46 So.2d 94, 97.\n\n\n After stating this to be the rule it followed, and citing a number of its past decisions which stated and applied the same rule, the highest court of Mississippi, in the opinion quoted from, because of that rule reversed a conviction obtained through the use of unconstitutionally seized evidence, even though as in the present case there had been no objection made at the time the evidence was presented. The court noted that it had applied this same rule in other cases where proper objection had not been made at the trial, citing its holdings in Fisher v. State, 145 Miss. 116, 110 So. 361, and Carter v. State, 198 Miss. 523, 21 So.2d 404. In all of those cases the defendant appears to have been represented by local counsel. Yet this Court now apparently holds that the state court may, if it chooses to do so, depart from its prior cases and apply a new, stricter rule against this defendant and thereby prevent this Court from reviewing the case to see that his federal constitutional rights were safeguarded. I do not believe the cherished federal constitutional right of a defendant to object to unconstitutionally seized evidence \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 457]\n\u00a0\n offered against him can be cut off irrevocably by state-court discretionary rulings which might be different in particular undefined circumstances in other cases. I think such a procedural device for shutting off our review of questions involving constitutional rights is too dangerous to be tolerated.\n\nFor these reasons I dissent from the disposition of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 154 So.2d 289, 296 (bound volume).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] I think that the very \"evidence\" cited in the Court's opinion points up the fact that there was no evidence from which it can be inferred that a conscious waiver was made. I can find no support, as the Court does, from an affidavit filed for the first time as an appendix to the State's brief in this Court, stating that the district attorney who tried the case had seen one of petitioner's counsel start to rise from his chair when the evidence from the search was introduced, but that another of petitioner's counsel gave a \"jerk on the coat tail\" of the lawyer, \"returning him to his seat.\" It is hard for me to see how one could infer from this \"jerk on the coat tail\" even a suspicion that petitioner had consciously and knowingly waived his right to object to the evidence offered against him.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n349 \nU.S., at 383\n (footnote omitted).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The attorneys for the State of Mississippi have no doubt that the State Supreme Court has this power. When the case was argued \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 456]\n\u00a0\n before this Court, the following exchange took place between a Justice and counsel for the State:\n\n\"Q. Does that mean there is a discretion in the [state] court where it can waive [a failure to object] if it sees fit under the circumstances?\n\n\n\"A. It did so in that case I'm talking about [Brooks v. State, infra in text] where in several respects the defendant's rights were just completely trampled.\n\n\n\"Q. It means that it's not an absolutely rigid, unbreakable, irrevocable rule?\n\n\n\"A. That's right. That's right, your honor.\n\n\n\"Q. And that the court can waive it if the circumstances in its judgment justify?\n\n\n\"A. That's correct.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nFlying banners of federalism, the Court's opinion actually raises storm signals of a most disquieting nature. While purporting to recognize the traditional principle that an adequate procedural, as well as substantive, state ground of decision bars direct review here of any federal claim asserted in the state litigation, the Court, unless I wholly misconceive what is lurking in today's opinion, portends a severe dilution, if not complete abolition, of the concept of \"adequacy\" as pertaining to state procedural grounds.\n\nIn making these preliminary observations I do not believe I am seeing ghosts. For I cannot account for the remand of this case in the face of what is a demonstrably adequate state procedural ground of decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court except as an early step toward extending in one way or another the doctrine of Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391\n, to direct review. In that case, decided only two Terms ago, the Court turned its back on history (see dissenting opinion of this writer, at 448 et seq.), and did away with the adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas corpus proceedings.\n\nBelieving that any step toward extending Noia to direct review should be flushed out and challenged at its earliest appearance in an opinion of this Court, I respectfully dissent. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Mississippi Supreme Court did not base its ultimate decision upon petitioner's federal claim that his wife's consent could not validate an otherwise improper police search of the family car, but on the procedural ground that petitioner (who was represented by three experienced lawyers) had not objected at the time the fruits of this search were received in evidence. This Court now strongly implies, but does not decide (in view of its remand on the \"waiver\" issue) that enforcement of the State's \"contemporaneous-objection\" rule was inadequate as a state ground of decision because the petitioner's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal afforded the trial judge a satisfactory opportunity to take \"appropriate corrective action\" with reference to the allegedly inadmissible evidence. Thus, it is suggested, this may be a situation where \"giving effect to the contemporaneous-objection rule for its own sake `would be to force resort to an arid ritual of meaningless form.'\" (Ante, p. 449.)\n\nFrom the standpoint of the realities of the courtroom, I can only regard the Court's analysis as little short of fanciful. The petitioner's motion for a verdict could have provoked one of three courses of action by the trial judge, none of which can reasonably be considered as depriving the State's contemporaneous-objection rule of its capacity to serve as an adequate state ground.\n\n1. The trial judge might have granted the directed verdict. But had this action been appropriate, the Supreme Court of Mississippi, in its first opinion, would have ordered the prosecution dismissed. Since it did not, and the matter is entirely one of state law, further speculation by this Court should be foreclosed.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. The trial judge might have directed a mistrial. The State's interest in preventing mistrials through the contemporaneous-objection requirement is obvious.\n\n3. The remaining course of action is the example given by the Court; the trial judge could have denied the motion for a directed verdict, but, sua sponte, called for elaboration of the argument, determined that the search of the automobile was unconstitutional, and given cautionary instructions to the jury to disregard the inadmissible evidence when the case was submitted to it.\n\nThe practical difficulties with this approach are manifestly sufficient to show a substantial state interest in their avoidance, and thus to show an \"adequate\" basis for the State's adherence to the contemporaneous-objection rule. To make my point I must quote the motion for directed verdict in full.\n\n \"Atty Carter: We're going to make a motion, your Honor, for a directed verdict in this case. We are going to base our motion on several grounds. First, we think that this whole process by which this defendant was brought or attempted to be brought into the jurisdiction of this Court is illegal and void. There is nothing in the record in this case to show that the warrant that was issued against this defendant was based upon - it must be based in this State and any other State on an affidavit, on a proper affidavit or a proper complaint by any party. True, there is some testimony that some affidavit was made, and the complaining witness said so, but in the record \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 460]\n\u00a0\n in this case which is before the Court, no such affidavit is present and there is a verification from the Justice of the Peace that no such affidavit is present in this case; therefore, we contend that the warrant under which this defendant was subjected to arrest was illegal and without force and effect. Secondly, we contend that the warrant having been issued and the testimony of this Mr. Collins on the stand to the effect that after he had placed this man under arrest, he then proceeded to go and search his car, and clearly, this is a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, and it is unlawful search and seizure so the evidence that they have secured against this defendant is illegal and unlawful. Finally, we contend that on the basis of these facts that the affidavit under which the defendant was tried before the Justice of the Peace Court, as we contended yesterday, based upon the statement that was sworn to by the County Attorney, not on information and belief, but directly that this is void and defective and could give the Justice of the Peace no jurisdiction in this case. We contend under these circumstances that the State - that this is an illegal process; that this man's rights have been violated under the Fourteenth Amendment, and finally, we contend that the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to any extent to implicate this man in this case. Now, on these basis [sic] we contend that this whole process is illegal and void, and that it has permeated and contended [sic] the whole process insofar as the jurisdiction of this Court is concerned or jurisdiction over this individual is concerned; therefore, he should be released, and we move for a directed verdict.\n\n\n \"Court: Motion overruled. Bring the jury back.\" \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 461]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The motion was renewed at the completion of the defense in the following language:\n\n \"Atty Carter: Your Honor, at this time at the close of the case we want to make a motion for a directed verdict. We base it on the grounds and the reasons which we set forth in our motion for a directed verdict at the close of the State's case. We make it now at the close of the entire case on those grounds and on the grounds that the evidence has not shown beyond any reasonable doubt under the law that the defendant is guilty of the charge. We therefore make a motion for a directed verdict at this time.\n\n\n \"Court: Motion is overruled.\"\n\n\n The single sentence in the first motion (supra, p. 460) is the only direct reference to the search and seizure question from beginning to end of the trial.\n\nAs every trial lawyer of any experience knows, motions for directed verdicts are generally made as a matter of course at the close of the prosecution's case, and are generally denied without close consideration unless the case is clearly borderline. It is simply unrealistic in this context to have expected the trial judge to pick out the single vague sentence from the directed verdict motion and to have acted upon it with the refined imagination the Court would require of him. Henry's three lawyers apparently regarded the search and seizure claim as makeweight. They had not mentioned it earlier in the trial and gave no explanation for their laxity in raising it. And when they did mention it, they did so in a cursory and conclusional sentence placed in a secondary position in a directed verdict motion. The theory underlying the search and seizure argument - that a wife's freely given permission to search the family car is invalid - is subtle to say the very least, and as the matter \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 462]\n\u00a0\n was presented to the trial judge it would have been extraordinary had he caught it, or even realized that there was a serious problem to catch. But this is not all the Court would require of him. He must, in addition, realize that despite the inappropriateness of granting the directed verdict requested of him, he could partially serve the cause of the defense by taking it upon himself to frame and give cautionary instructions to the jury to disregard the evidence obtained as fruits of the search.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nContrast with this the situation presented by a contemporaneous objection. The objection must necessarily be directed to the single question of admissibility; the judge must inevitably focus on it; there would be no doubt as to the appropriate form of relief, and the effect of the trial judge's decision would be immediate rather than remote. Usually the proper timing of an objection will force an elaboration of it. Had objection been made in this case during the officer's testimony about the search, it would have called forth of its own force the specific answer that the wife had given her permission and, in turn, the assertion that the permission was ineffective. The issue, in short, would have been advertently \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 463]\n\u00a0\n faced by the trial judge and the likelihood of achieving a correct result maximized.\n\nThus the state interest which so powerfully supports the contemporaneous-objection rule is that of maximizing correct decisions and concomitantly minimizing errors requiring mistrials and retrials. The alternative for the State is to reverse a trial judge who, from a long motion, fails to pick out and act with remarkable imagination upon a single vague sentence relating to admissibility of evidence long since admitted. A trial judge is a decision-maker, not an advocate. To force him out of his proper role by requiring him to coax out the arguments and imaginatively reframe the requested remedies for the counsel before him is to place upon him more responsibility than a trial judge can be expected to discharge.\n\nThere was no \"appropriate corrective action\" that could have realistically satisfied the purposes of the contemporaneous-objection rule. Without question the State had an interest in maintaining the integrity of its procedure, and thus without doubt reliance on the rule in question is \"adequate\" to bar direct review of petitioner's federal claim by this Court.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe real reason for remanding this case emerges only in the closing pages of the Court's opinion. It is pointed out that even were the contemporaneous-objection rule considered to be an adequate state ground, this would not, under Fay v. Noia, preclude consideration of Henry's federal \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 464]\n\u00a0\n claim in federal habeas corpus unless it were made to appear that Henry had deliberately waived his federal claim in the state proceedings. It is then said that in the interest of \"efficient administration of criminal justice\" and \"harmonious\" relations between the federal and state judiciaries the Mississippi courts should be given the opportunity to pass, in the first instance, on the waiver issue; the prospect is entertained that such action on the part of this Court will encourage the States to grasp the \"opportunity\" afforded by Fay v. Noia and Townsend v. Sain by providing \"state procedures, direct or collateral, for a full airing of federal claims.\" It is \"suggested\" that were this to be done \"irritation\" and \"friction\" respecting the exercise of federal habeas corpus power vis-a-vis state convictions \"might be ameliorated.\"\n\nWhat does all this signify? The States are being invited to voluntarily obliterate all state procedures, however conducive they may be to the orderly conduct of litigation, which might thwart state-court consideration of federal claims. But what if the States do not accept the invitation? Despite the Court's soft-spoken assertion that \"settled principles\" will be applied in the future, I do not think the intimation will be missed by any discerning reader of the Court's opinion that at the least a substantial dilution of the adequate state-ground doctrine may be expected. A contrary prediction is belied by the implication of the opinion that under \"settled principles,\" the contemporaneous-objection rule relied upon in this case could be declared inadequate.\n\nTo me this would not be a move toward \"harmonious\" federalism; any further disrespect for state procedures, no longer cognizable at all in federal habeas corpus, would be the very antithesis of it. While some may say that, given Fay v. Noia, what the Court is attempting to do is justifiable as a means of promoting \"efficiency\" in the administration of criminal justice, it is the sort of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 465]\n\u00a0\n efficiency which, though perhaps appropriate in some watered-down form of federalism, is not congenial to the kind of federalism I had supposed was ours. I venture to say that to all who believe the federal system as we have known it to be a priceless aspect of our Constitutionalism, the spectre implicit in today's decision will be no less disturbing than what the Court has already done in Fay v. Noia.\n\nBelieving that the judgment below rests on an adequate independent state ground, I would dismiss the writ issued in this case as improvidently granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court, as a matter of state law, could have found (a) that there was sufficient corroborative evidence, (b) that none was necessary, or (c) that retrial was necessary to prevent defendants in criminal \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 459]\n\u00a0\n cases from hanging back until the completion of the State's case and then for the first time moving to strike a piece of evidence crucial to getting the case to the jury.\n\nThe Court's suggestion (ante, p. 449, n. 4) that we may proceed on the speculation that the Mississippi Supreme Court \"overlooked\" the renewal of the motion for directed verdict made at the completion of the case hardly requires comment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Furthermore, even if counsel had fully elaborated the argument and had made it in the context of a motion to strike rather than a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge could properly have exercised his discretion (as the Mississippi Supreme Court did) and denied any relief. This power is recognized in trial judges in the federal system in order to prevent the \"ambushing\" of a trial through the withholding of an objection that should have been made when questionable evidence was first introduced. Federalism is turned upside down if it is denied to judges in the state systems. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 41 (e) and 26; United States v. Milanovich, 303 F.2d 626, cert. denied, \n371 \nU.S. 876\n; Hollingsworth v. United States, 321 F.2d 342, 350; Isaacs v. United States, 301 F.2d 706, 734-735, cert. denied, \n371 \nU.S. 818\n; United States v. Murray, 297 F.2d 812, 818, cert. denied, \n369 \nU.S. 828\n; Metcalf v. United States, 195 F.2d 213, 216-217.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] As the first opinion by the Mississippi Supreme Court shows, there is discretion in certain circumstances to lower the procedural bar. It does not follow that this Court is completely free to exercise that discretion. Even in cases from lower federal courts we do so only if there has been an abuse. If, in order to insulate its decisions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip itself of the discretionary power to differentiate between different sets of circumstances, the rule operates in a most perverse way. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 443, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERALD PUBLISHING CO. v.

VIRGINIA(1965)\nNo. 464\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1965\n\n\n\n\n A state judge denied a motion of petitioner Dawley that the judge disqualify himself for bias from trying Dawley for contempt arising out of his conduct as a lawyer in handling a libel case pending in that judge's court. In arguing a subsequent change of venue motion which Dawley filed, another lawyer, petitioner Holt, read to the judge that motion, which charged the judge with \"acting as police officer, chief prosecution witness . . . grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge\" with respect to the contempt case against Dawley and with intimidating and harassing Holt in his efforts to defend Dawley. The judge then summarily adjudged both petitioners in contempt for the change of venue plea, which he denied, and for the supporting argument and later fined each $50. The State's highest court affirmed, holding that the language used in the motion violated a state statute authorizing summary contempt punishment for use of \"[v]ile, contemptuous or insulting language\" concerning a judge's official acts. Held: Petitioners were deprived of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for doing no more than exercising the constitutional right of an accused and his counsel to defend against the contempt charges made against them. Pp. 136-138.\n\n (a) A defendant charged with contempt such as this has the constitutional right to be heard and to be represented by counsel, who also has a constitutional right to present his client's case. P. 136.\n\n\n (b) The motion for change of venue to escape a biased tribunal raised a relevant issue. P. 136.\n\n\n (c) The assertedly \"insulting\" character of the charges in the motions was inherent in the issue of bias raised. P. 137.\n\n\n 205 Va. 332, 136 S. E. 2d 809, reversed and remanded.\n\nMarvin M. Karpatkin argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief were Melvin L. Wulf, Joseph A. Jordan and Leonard W. Holt. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrancis C. Lee argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Robert Y. Button, Attorney General of Virginia, and D. Gardiner Tyler, Assistant Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioners, both of whom are lawyers, were adjudged guilty and each was fined $50 for contempt of court by the Circuit Court of the City of Hopewell, Virginia. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contentions that their convictions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 205 Va. 332, 136 S. E. 2d 809. We granted certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 957\n.\n\nThe charges against petitioners came about in this way. Petitioner Dawley represented certain defendants in a libel suit pending before Circuit Judge Holladay. The libel case was dismissed by agreement of the parties. After the dismissal Judge Holladay had the court clerk and counsel, including the petitioner Dawley, come into the judge's chambers and there the judge asked Dawley three times if he had had anything to do with making the defendants in the libel case \"unavailable to be served with subpoenas.\" Dawley refused to answer and later, in court, again refused to answer. Judge Holladay then directed the Commonwealth's Attorney to prepare an order directing Dawley to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. Dawley thereafter filed a motion requesting Judge Holladay to disqualify himself from trying the contempt case. Judge Holladay denied this motion. Dawley then filed a motion for change of venue. Petitioner Holt appeared as counsel representing Dawley and read this motion to the judge as a part of his argument urging a change of venue. It is upon the allegations \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n about Judge Holladay in that motion and the reading of them by Holt that the present convictions for contempt are based.\n\nThe motion for change of venue charged, among other things, that because of local prejudice Dawley could not get a fair trial in Hopewell and, crucial to this contempt conviction,\n\n \"3. That the said Judge Carlton E. Holladay, who presided as Judge in said libel suit, and who fails and refuses to disqualify himself as Judge in the pending trial of the Defendant, E. A. Dawley, Jr., has, with respect to said contempt action and is now in effect and\/or in fact acting as police officer, chief prosecution witness, adverse witness for the defense, grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge.\n\n\n \"4. That in addition to the foregoing, said Judge Carlton E. Holladay did intimidate and harass and is intimidating and harassing the lawyer representing said E. A. Dawley, Jr., viz, Leonard W. Holt, Esq., the effect of which is to seriously hamper the efforts of said Leonard W. Holt in defending the said E. A. Dawley, Jr.; that said harassment and intimidation arises out of and is connected solely with said Leonard W. Holt's participating in the defense of said E. A. Dawley, Jr. in the contempt action; that part of said harassment and intimidation occurred at a hearing of this contempt action in the Hopewell Circuit Court on January 8, 1962, at which hearing the said Carlton E. Holladay revealed that he had been making an independent investigation and inquiry of Mr. Holt's conduct in this contempt defense, and said Judge at said place and time made the statement that he would `deal with' said Leonard W. Holt after he, the judge, had dealt with said E. A. Dawley, Jr.\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n After these charges were read to Judge Holladay by Holt, this colloquy took place:\n\n  \"The Court: On the motion for change of venue,  does that apply whether your client would be tried  before a jury or before the Court? Does it apply in  both cases?\n\n\n  \"Mr. Holt: We say it would apply.\n\n\n  \"The Court: Apply in both cases.\n\n\n  \"At this time I might say that I do not see how  that this Court can pass unnoticed the matters and  things that have been presented to the Court by  Mr. Dawley in a plea filed in the Court and presented  here in Court and by Mr. Holt as his counsel and  argued in court. I think that the plea is contemptuous,  I think the argument is contemptuous.\n\n\n  \"At this time both E. A. Dawley, Jr., and Leonard  W. Holt are held and adjudged summarily to be in  contempt of this Court.\n\n\n  \"I will take under advisement the punishment and  advise you of it during the day.\n\n\n  \"Court will adjourn for lunch.\n\n\n  \"Mr. Holt: Please, before the Court adjourns, may  we get the specificity on the part of the Court regarding  what is considered in the pleading, if anything,  contemptuous? I think under the laws of the Commonwealth  and United States we are in this position  - that if something has been said which is contemptuous,  there be elements of intent that should  be present, and if the element of intent be present,  and there are certain things which flow under it in  terms -\n\n\n  \"The Court: I don't think that you need any  specification or bill of particulars on that. I think  that you can read it, Mr. Dawley can read it, and I  think it is plain to the people who are in the courtroom \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n  that the remarks are contemptuous, and you  summarily have been held in contempt of Court.\n\n\n  \"And Court stands adjourned at this time for  lunch.\"\n\n\n Thereafter the judge denied the motion for change of venue and fined each petitioner $50.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, in affirming, held that the language used in the motion violated Va. Code Ann. 18.1-292 (1960 Repl. Vol.), which authorizes summary punishment of a person who misbehaves in the presence of the court so as to obstruct justice, or who uses \"[v]ile, contemptuous or insulting language\" to or about a judge in respect of his official acts.\n1\n Petitioners contend that their convictions through this application of the state law to them in several respects deny due process of law guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The view we take regarding one of these contentions makes it unnecessary for us to consider the others.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is not charged that petitioners here disobeyed any valid court order, talked loudly, acted boisterously, or attempted to prevent the judge or any other officer of the court from carrying on his court duties. Their convictions rest on nothing whatever except allegations made in motions for change of venue and disqualification of Judge Holladay because of alleged bias on his part. It is not claimed, and probably could not seriously be claimed, that petitioners, by filing their motions, violated any duty they owed the court. Dawley had been ordered by the judge to appear to defend himself against a charge of contempt and Holt appeared as his counsel. And it is settled that due process and the Sixth Amendment guarantee a defendant charged with contempt such as this \"an opportunity to be heard in his defense - a right to his day in court - . . . and to be represented by counsel.\" In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 273\n. See also Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n. The right to be heard must necessarily embody a right to file motions and pleadings essential to present claims and raise relevant issues. See Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, \n373 \nU.S. 96, 105\n. And since \"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process,\" In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133, 136\n, it necessarily follows that motions for change of venue to escape a biased tribunal raise constitutional issues both relevant and essential. Cf. Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717, 722\n; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n. Consequently, neither Dawley nor his counsel could consistently with due process be convicted for contempt for filing these motions unless it might be thought that there \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n is something about the language used which would justify the conviction.\n\nAs previously stated, the words used in the motions were plain English, in no way offensive in themselves, and wholly appropriate to charge bias in the community and bias of the presiding judge. The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia considered the motion for change of venue \"a vehicle to heap insults upon the court, a studied attempt to smear the judge.\" 205 Va., at 338, 136 S. E. 2d, at 814. But if the charges were \"insulting\" it was inherent in the issue of bias raised, an issue which we have seen had to be raised, according to the charges, to escape the probability of a constitutionally unfair trial. Virginia apparently contends here that the right to present a defense is not involved in this case either (1) because the motion for change of venue was not in the proper form and not authorized by state law in such circumstances, or (2) because the charges of bias were false. As to the first argument, assuming it could have any relevance where a defendant asserts a federally guaranteed right to a fair trial, the motion for change of venue was duly filed with the clerk, and the trial court without objection set it down for hearing, specifically invited argument on it, and decided the motion on the merits, without any intimation that a motion for change of venue was not proper in these circumstances. Nor can we accept Virginia's apparent contention that the contempt convictions should be sustained on the ground that petitioners' charges of bias were false. The issue of truth or falsity of these charges was not heard, the trial court choosing instead to convict and sentence petitioners for having done nothing more than make the charges. Even if failure to prove their allegations of bias could under any circumstances ever be made part of the basis of a contempt charge against petitioners, these convictions cannot rest on any such unproven assumption. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur conclusion is that these petitioners have been punished by Virginia for doing nothing more than exercising the constitutional right of an accused and his counsel in contempt cases such as this to defend against the charges made. The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The courts and judges may issue attachments for contempt, and punish them summarily, only in the cases following:\n\n\"(1) Misbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice;\n\n\n\"(2) Violence, or threats of violence, to a judge or officer of the court, or to a juror, witness or party going to, attending or returning from the court, for or in respect of any act or proceeding had or to be had in such court;\n\n\n\"(3) Vile, contemptuous or insulting language addressed to or published of a judge for or in respect of any act or proceeding had, or to be had, in such court, or like language used in his presence and intended for his hearing for or in respect of such act or proceeding;\n\n\n\"(4) Misbehavior of an officer of the court in his official character;\n\n\n\"(5) Disobedience or resistance of an officer of the court, juror, witness or other person to any lawful process, judgment, decree or order of the court.\" Va.

In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 277\n-278, whether summary conviction of Dawley was invalid because he committed no act in open court, and whether Judge Holladay was so personally embroiled and interested in the controversy that he should not have decided the contempt issue.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has in effect held that the manner in which petitioners presented their motion for a change of venue violated professional standards governing members of the Virginia Bar. This Court now sets aside the trivial disciplinary penalty imposed simply because in its view petitioners' conduct was not out of bounds. Believing that any differences over the professional propriety of petitioners' actions involve nothing of constitutional proportions, I would affirm the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] I do not think that any of the other contentions not reached by this Court can be said, on this record, to present a substantial federal question (ante, pp. 135-136, n. 2). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOURIHAN v.

JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nBoth of these cases, today affirmed summarily by the Court, raise serious problems concerning the scope of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 694, 695]\n\u00a0\n the discretion of a federal court to fashion interim relief in state reapportionment cases, matters not hitherto decided by this Court.\n\n    No. 623.\n\n\n The New York Constitution, Art. III, 2, provides that the State Legislature will be elected every two years, serving for two annual sessions. Between sessions the Legislature normally works in committee, conducting hearings and drafting reports to be submitted at the following session. In WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, \n377 \nU.S. 633\n, this Court held the New York legislative apportionment formula invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, and remanded the cause to the District Court for appropriate relief. Among other things, the Court authorized the District Court in its discretion to permit the November 1964 elections to proceed under the invalidated apportionment \"in order to give the New York Legislature an opportunity to fashion a constitutionally valid legislative apportionment plan . . . .\" \n377 \nU.S., at 655\n.\n\nThe District Court, on July 27, 1964, entered a decree permitting the November 1964 elections to be conducted under the invalidated plan, but limiting the term of the Legislature to one year. The decree also ordered that an election be held in November 1965 under a valid apportionment plan, to be enacted by the Legislature by April 1, 1965,\n**\n and that the Legislature elected in 1965 would also serve for only one year so that the November 1966 election would be held as scheduled by state law. As a result of this order New York will have to conduct three elections in as many years, and forgo the normal work of the Legislature between sessions. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 694, 696]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    No. 718.\n\n\n Virginia elects its lower house, the House of Delegates, every two years to serve for one biennial session of the General Assembly. The Senate is elected for four years to serve during two sessions of the General Assembly which are held each January following the election of the House of Delegates. In November 1962 the District Court held the Virginia apportionment of both houses unconstitutional, and enjoined any further elections under the invalidated plan. Pending appeal to this Court, THE CHIEF JUSTICE stayed the injunction of the District Court, and the 1963 elections were held under the invalidated plan. After the District Court was affirmed on the merits, Davis v. Mann, \n377 \nU.S. 678\n, that court entered a decree on September 18, 1964, directing the General Assembly to reapportion in time for the November 1965 election of the House of Delegates, and ordered further that a special election be held at the same time to elect a properly apportioned Senate to serve for two years. Thus the present Senate, elected in November 1963 to serve for four years, has been limited to a two-year term, and the Senate to be elected next November will also be so limited.\n\nThe orders of the District Courts entered in these two cases present for me important questions which deserve plenary consideration by this Court. I would note probable jurisdiction in both cases and set them for argument on the earliest practicable date at the next argument session of the Court commencing March 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote **\n] Such a plan, enacted by the New York Legislature, has recently been approved by the District Court.\n\n\n[379 \nU.S. 694, 1]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE RYAN(1965)\nNo. 748\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\n\nJoseph A.

UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 347\nArgued: March 9, 1965Decided: May 17, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The day before the six-year limitation period for a willful attempt to evade federal income taxes would have expired, the Government filed a complaint with a Commissioner charging petitioner with that offense. Section 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides for an extension of the limitation period for nine months from the filing of a complaint. The complaint, an Internal Revenue Service Agent, swore that he had investigated petitioner's liability for the taxable year by examining petitioner's returns, by interviewing persons with whom petitioner did business and those familiar with his financial condition, and by consulting records reflecting petitioner's income; and that based on such investigation the complainant had personal knowledge of petitioner's willful attempt to evade his taxes by understating his income in the amount stated. The Commissioner determined that the complaint showed probable cause for believing that petitioner had committed the offense and issued a summons for him to appear at a preliminary hearing, which was not held, the complaint having been superseded over a month later by an indictment with a count applicable to the offense charged in the complaint. Petitioner moved to dismiss that count as insufficient because it did not show probable cause for believing that he had committed the offense, a claim which both the trial court and the Court of Appeals rejected. Held:\n\n 1. To initiate the time extension authorized by 6531, it is not enough that the complaint state the essential facts of the offense of willful attempted tax evasion but the complaint must show that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed that offense; and all the other steps of the complaint procedure provided by Rules 3, 4 and 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must be satisfied. Pp. 217-221.\n\n\n  (a) The Commissioner's basic functions under the Rules are not just to receive a complaint such as the one here which states the essential facts of the offense but to determine that probable cause exists and to warn the defendant of his rights.

Howard and Norman Sepenuk.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe statute of limitations on the felony of willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes requires the Government to obtain an indictment for that offense within six years of the date of its commission, with the proviso:\n\n\". . . Where a complaint is instituted before a commissioner of the United States within the period above limited, the time shall be extended until the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n date which is 9 months after the date of the making of the complaint before the commissioner of the United States. . . .\" Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 6531.\n\n\n On April 15, 1963, the day before the six-year period was to expire, the Government filed a complaint against petitioner Jaben charging him with willfully filing a false return for the year 1956. The Commissioner determined that the complaint showed probable cause for believing that Jaben had committed the offense, and, at the Government's request, issued a summons ordering Jaben to appear at a preliminary hearing on May 15, 1963. On May 11, 1963, the preliminary hearing on the complaint was continued to May 22, 1963, at the request of the United States Attorney, and without objection by petitioner. The preliminary hearing was never held since, on May 17, 1963, the grand jury superseded the complaint procedure by returning an indictment against Jaben, one count of which covered the 1956 attempted evasion which the complaint had charged. The indictment was not returned within the normal six-year limitation period, but if the complaint filed with the Commissioner was valid for the purpose of bringing the nine-month extension into play, then the indictment was timely. Jaben moved to dismiss the count of the indictment pertaining to 1956, arguing that the complaint was insufficient because it did not show probable cause for believing that he had committed the offense. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected this claim, 333 F.2d 535. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 878\n, to resolve a conflict with United States v. Greenberg, 320 F.2d 467, decided by the Ninth Circuit, in which an identical claim, based on a virtually identical complaint, was accepted. For reasons that follow we agree with the Eighth Circuit and affirm its judgment. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nUnder the Government's interpretation of 6531, probable cause is not relevant to the complaint's ability to initiate the extension of the limitation period. Section 6531 provides that the nine-month extension is brought into play \"[w]here a complaint is instituted before a commissioner of the United States\" within the six-year period of limitations (supra, pp. 215-216). Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure defines a complaint as\n\n\". . . a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be made upon oath before a commissioner or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the United States.\"\n\n\n Since the Government's complaint stated the essential facts constituting the offense of attempted tax evasion and was made upon oath before a Commissioner, the Government contends that regardless of the complaint's adequacy for any other purposes, it was valid for the purpose of triggering the nine-month extension of the limitation period whether or not it showed probable cause. The Government would, thus, totally ignore the further steps in the complaint procedure required by Rules 4 and 5.\n1\n Indeed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n it follows from its position that once having filed a complaint, the Government need not further pursue the complaint procedure at all, and, in the event that the defendant pressed for a preliminary hearing and obtained a dismissal of the complaint, that the Government could nonetheless rely upon the complaint as having extended the limitation period.\n\nWe do not accept the Government's interpretation. Its effort to look solely to Rule 3 and ignore the requirements of the Rules that follow would deprive the institution of the complaint before the Commissioner of any independent meaning which might rationally have led Congress to fasten upon it as the method for initiating the nine-month extension. The Commissioner's function, on that view, would be merely to rubber-stamp the complaint. The Government seeks to give his role importance in its version of 6531 by pointing out that he would administer the oath, receive the complaint, and make sure that it stated facts constituting the offense (a requirement which would be met by a charge in the words of the statute); but surely these matters are essentially formalities. The argument ignores the fact that the Commissioner's basic functions under the Rules are to make the judgment that probable cause exists and to warn defendants of their rights. Furthermore, if we do not look beyond Rule 3, there is no provision for notifying the defendant that he has been charged and the period of limitations extended. (Indeed, it is not until we reach Rule 4 that we find a requirement that the complaint \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n must show who it was that committed the offense.) Notice to a criminal defendant is usually achieved by service upon him of the summons or arrest warrant provided for in Rule 4. Neither is appropriate absent a judgment by the Commissioner that the complaint shows probable cause, and no other form of notice is specified by the Rules.\n\nMore basically, the evident statutory purpose of the nine-month extension provision is to afford the Government an opportunity to indict criminal tax offenders in the event that a grand jury is not in session at the end of the normal limitation period. This is confirmed by the immediate precursor of the present section which provided for an extension \"until the discharge of the grand jury at its next session within the district.\" I. R. C. 1939, 3748 (a).\n2\n Clearly the statute was not meant to grant the Government greater time in which to make its case (a result which could have been accomplished simply by making the normal period of limitation six years and nine months), but rather was intended to deal with the situation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 220]\n\u00a0\n in which the Government has its case made within the normal limitation period but cannot obtain an indictment because of the grand jury schedule. The Government's interpretation does not reflect this statutory intention, for it provides no safeguard whatever to prevent the Government from filing a complaint at a time when it does not have its case made, and then using the nine-month period to make it.\n\nThe better view of 6531 is that the complaint, to initiate the time extension, must be adequate to begin effectively the criminal process prescribed by the Federal Criminal Rules. It must be sufficient to justify the next steps in the process - those of notifying the defendant and bringing him before the Commissioner for a preliminary hearing. To do so the complaint must satisfy the probable cause requirement of Rule 4. Furthermore, we think that the Government must proceed through the further steps of the complaint procedure by affording the defendant a preliminary hearing as required by Rule 5, unless before the preliminary hearing is held, the grand jury supersedes the complaint procedure by returning an indictment. This interpretation of the statute reflects its purpose by insuring that within a reasonable time following the filing of the complaint, either the Commissioner will decide whether there is sufficient cause to bind the defendant over for grand jury action, or the grand jury itself will have decided whether or not to indict. A dismissal of the complaint before the indictment is returned would vitiate the time extension.\n\nIn this case the Government obtained a superseding indictment before any preliminary hearing took place. Under the interpretation which we have adopted it follows that if the complaint satisfied the requirements of Rules 3 and 4, in particular the probable cause standard of Rule 4, then the nine-month extension had come into \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n play and had not been cut off by any later dismissal of the complaint.\n3\n We turn then to the question whether the complaint showed probable cause.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Jaben complaint read as follows:\n\n \"The undersigned complaint, being duly sworn, states:\n\n\n \"That he is a Special Agent of the Internal Revenue Service and, in the performance of the duties imposed on him by law, he has conducted an investigation of the Federal income tax liability of Max Jaben for the calendar year 1956, by examining the said taxpayer's tax return for the year 1956 and other years; by identifying and interviewing third parties with whom the said taxpayer did business; by consulting public and private records reflecting the said taxpayer's income; and by interviewing third \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 222]\n\u00a0\n persons having knowledge of the said taxpayer's financial condition.\n\n\n \"That based on the aforesaid investigation, the complainant has personal knowledge that on or about the 16th day of April, 1957, at Kansas City, Missouri, in the Western District of Missouri, Max Jaben did unlawfully and wilfully attempt to evade and defeat the income taxes due and owing by him to the United States of America for the calendar year 1956, by filing and causing to be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Kansas City, Missouri, at Kansas City, Missouri, a false and fraudulent income tax return, wherein he stated that his taxable income for the calendar year 1956 was $17,665.31, and that the amount of tax due and owing thereon was the sum of $6,017.32, when in fact his taxable income for the said calendar year was the sum of $40,001.76 upon which said taxable income he owed to the United States of America an income tax of $14,562.99.\n\n\n  \"[Signed] David A. Thompson   \"Special Agent    \"Internal Revenue Service    \"Kansas City, Missouri.\"\n\n\n Petitioner argues that the complaint is basically indistinguishable from that which the Court found wanting in Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480\n. The Giordenello complaint read in relevant part:\n\n\"The undersigned complaint being duly sworn states: That on or about January 26, 1956, at Houston. Texas in the Southern District of Texas, Veto Giordenello did receive, conceal, etc., narcotic drugs, to-wit: heroin hydrochloride with knowledge of unlawful importation; in violation of Section 174, Title 21, United States Code. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"And the complainant further states that he believes that ___________ ____________\n4\n are material witnesses in relation to this charge.\"\n\n\n The complaints there and here are materially distinguishable. Information in a complaint alleging the commission of a crime falls into two categories: (1) that information which, if true, would directly indicate commission of the crime charged, and (2) that which relates to the source of the directly incriminating information. The Giordenello complaint gave no source information whatsoever. Its directly incriminating information consisted merely of an allegation in the words of the statute, and even then incomplete, supplemented by \"on or about January 26, 1956, at Houston.\" If the Jaben complaint were as barren, it would have stated simply that \"on or about April 16, 1957, at Kansas City, Missouri, Jaben willfully filed a false income tax return.\" In fact, it gave dollars-and-cents figures for the amounts which allegedly should have been returned and the amounts actually returned. As to sources, the affiant indicated that he, in his official capacity, had personally conducted an investigation in the course of which he had examined the taxpayer's returns for 1956 and other years, interviewed third persons with whom the taxpayer did business and others having knowledge of his financial condition, and consulted public and private records reflecting the taxpayer's income; and that the conclusion that Jaben had committed the offense was based upon this investigation.\n\nBeyond the substance of the complaint there is a material distinction in the nature of the offense charged. Some offenses are subject to putative establishment by blunt and concise factual allegations, e. g., \"A saw narcotics in B's possession,\" whereas \"A saw B file a false tax return\" does not mean very much in a tax evasion case. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 224]\n\u00a0\n Establishment of grounds for belief that the offense of tax evasion has been committed often requires a reconstruction of the taxpayer's income from many individually unrevealing facts which are not susceptible of a concise statement in a complaint. Furthermore, unlike narcotics informants, for example, whose credibility may often be suspect, the sources in this tax evasion case are much less likely to produce false or untrustworthy information. Thus, whereas some supporting information concerning the credibility of informants in narcotics cases or other common garden varieties of crime may be required, such information is not so necessary in the context of the case before us.\n\nGiordenello v. United States, supra, and Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108\n, established that a magistrate is intended to make a neutral judgment that resort to further criminal process is justified. A complaint must provide a foundation for that judgment. It must provide the affiant's answer to the magistrate's hypothetical question, \"What makes you think that the defendant committed the offense charged?\" This does not reflect a requirement that the Commissioner ignore the credibility of the complaining witness. There is a difference between dis-believing the affiant and requiring him to indicate some basis for his allegations. Obviously any reliance upon factual allegations necessarily entails some degree of reliance upon the credibility of the source. See, e. g., Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 13\n. Nor does it indicate that each factual allegation which the affiant puts forth must be independently documented, or that each and every fact which contributed to his conclusions be spelled out in the complaint. Compare United States v. Ventresca, \n380 \nU.S. 102\n. It simply requires that enough information be presented to the Commissioner to enable him to make the judgment that the charges are not \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 225]\n\u00a0\n capricious and are sufficiently supported to justify bringing into play the further steps of the criminal process.\n\nIn this instance the issue of probable cause comes down to the adequacy of the basis given for the allegation that petitioner's income was $40,001.76 instead of the $17,665.31 he had reported. This is not the type of fact that can be physically observed. The amount of petitioner's income could only be determined by examining records and interviewing third persons familiar with petitioner's financial condition. Compare Holland v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 121\n. Here the affiant, a Special Agent of the Internal Revenue Service, swore that he had conducted just such an investigation and thereafter swore that he had personal knowledge as to petitioner's actual income. In such circumstances, the magistrate would be justified in accepting the agent's judgment of what he \"saw\" without requiring him to bring the records and persons to court, to list and total the items of unreported income or to otherwise explain how petitioner's actual income was calculated.\n\nWe conclude that the challenged count of this indictment is not time-barred.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 4 (a) provides:\n\n\"If it appears from the complaint that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it. Upon the request of the attorney for the government a summons instead of a warrant shall issue. . . . If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant shall issue.\"\n\n\n Rule 5 (c) provides:\n\n\". . . If the defendant waives preliminary examination, the commissioner shall forthwith hold him to answer in the district court. If the defendant does not waive examination, the commissioner shall \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n hear the evidence within a reasonable time. The defendant may cross-examine witnesses against him and may introduce evidence in his own behalf. If from the evidence it appears to the commissioner that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, the commissioner shall forthwith hold him to answer in the district court; otherwise the commissioner shall discharge him. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This provision was introduced into the tax laws in 1884 by way of an amendment to a bill providing for a limitation period. In proposing the amendment on the floor of the Senate, Senator Hoar stated:\n\n\"As has already been said, this limitation which purports to be a limitation of two years is in point of fact in many districts but a limitation of one year, because the indictment must be found by a grand jury within two years within the commission of the offense. If the offense be concealed, or if it be discovered a year before the grand jury meet, it would be too late to make the prosecution. I move this amendment:\n\n\n\"`Provided, That where a complaint shall be instituted before a commissioner of the United States within the period above limited, the period shall be extended until the discharge of the grand jury at its next session within the district.'\n\n\n\"I think there will be no objection to that.\" 15 Cong. Rec. 5771. The time for which the period was extended was changed to nine months in 1954.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] A dissenting opinion accepts our interpretation of the statute, but, likening petitioner's position to one who is incarcerated awaiting a preliminary hearing, argues that petitioner was not scheduled to have a preliminary hearing within the \"reasonable time\" required by Rule 5 (c). We reject this view of the case. (1) Although the statute should be interpreted to reflect its intent, it greatly overplays that intent to invest the procedure required to effectuate it with the same sense of urgency which might be thought to attend a preliminary hearing for an incarcerated prisoner. (2) A defendant can fully protect himself from unreasonable delay by moving for advancement of the preliminary hearing date and by objecting to any postponements. Petitioner made no such motion or objection, and at no point in the trial or appellate review of this case has he objected to the scheduling of the preliminary hearing.\n\nMallory v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 449\n, did not deal with preliminary hearings under Rule 5 (c), but with the requirement of Rule 5 (a) that a person who is arrested must be taken \"without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner\" so that he can be apprised of his rights.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] So in original.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\nThe Court rejects the contention of the Government that the filing of a complaint fulfilling the requirements of Rule 3 suffices to trigger the provisions of 6531 extending the period of limitations. The Court holds that the complaint must also satisfy the probable-cause requirement of Rule 4 and that the Government must proceed with the preliminary hearing under Rule 5. Section 6531 provides that \"[w]here a complaint is instituted\" the time shall be extended. Assuming that the \"complaint\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 226]\n\u00a0\n specified in this provision is one satisfying Rule 4 as well as Rule 3, the statute affords no basis whatever for the Court's holding that the Government must proceed with the preliminary hearing and that \"dismissal of the complaint before the indictment is returned would vitiate the time extension,\" ante, at 220, even though an indictment were obtained thereafter within the nine-month period. The statute is unequivocal that the period is extended when the complaint is instituted and, in my view, requires nothing further of the Government.\n\nBecause I agree with the Court that the complaint supplied an adequate foundation for the Commissioner's determination that probable cause existed, I deem it unnecessary to consider whether 6531 contemplates a complaint establishing probable cause or merely compliance with Rule 3.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nI agree with the Court that the purpose of the tolling provision in the statute of limitations before us, as evidenced by its language and its legislative history, is to avoid penalizing the Government when a criminal defendant cannot be indicted merely because no grand jury is sitting at the time the limitation period expires. In keeping with this purpose, the Government ought to be allowed to present a case prepared before the expiration of the limitation period to the grand jury when it next convenes, but it ought not to be allowed to take advantage of a nine-month extension to prepare a case which was not ready for submission before the end of the statutory period. I believe that the Court, therefore, is quite correct in rejecting the Government's argument that the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 227]\n\u00a0\n filing of any complaint which meets the formal requirements of Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. The Government's argument would, in effect, allow it an additional nine months in every case. Rather, the view that I would accept as correct is that the only complaint that tolls the statute is one that begins effectively the criminal process prescribed by the Federal Rules.\n\nI further agree with the Court that a complaint has effectively begun the criminal process only when all of the pre-indictment steps detailed in Rules 3, 4, and 5 have been taken. Only when it has been determined in the preliminary hearing required by Rule 5 that probable cause exists \"to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it\" can we say with any assurance that the complaint was not filed merely to extend the limitation period, but that it was a complaint which does what a complaint normally does, namely, starts the criminal procedure in motion. A speedy determination by a disinterested magistrate - the United States Commissioner - that probable cause exists also provides assurance that the Government in fact had a case ready for presentation to the grand jury before the limitation period expired. Thus I join the Court's opinion insofar as it holds that only those complaints toll the statute of limitations which also start the criminal machinery in motion by leading to a preliminary hearing in compliance with Rules 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe facts of this case lead me to conclude, however, that the procedure outlined in Rule 5 was not followed, for a preliminary hearing was not scheduled within a reasonable time as the Rule requires. A person who is arrested must be taken before a Commissioner immediately and informed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 228]\n\u00a0\n of his rights, and a preliminary examination to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that an offense has been committed and that he committed it must be held at that time or promptly thereafter. See Mallory v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 449, 454\n. This preliminary examination must be held promptly because it normally determines whether holding a defendant in custody pending action by the grand jury is warranted. Even when a defendant is not actually in custody but is free on bond a speedy hearing is still necessary, for he should not be required to maintain bond unless it has been determined by a disinterested Commissioner that probable cause exists. While normally when a summons is issued, rather than an arrest warrant, the period of time within which a preliminary examination must be held may be longer than when a defendant has been arrested, for he is not in custody nor need he post bond, in the special circumstances present here involving a statutory period of repose, it is important that the preliminary hearing be held with expedition similar to that necessary when the defendant is in custody or free on bond. A prompt preliminary hearing in this type of case serves as a check to prevent the Government from beginning a prosecution when a case is not ready for submission to the grand jury before the limitation period expires. I should think that, in view of this purpose, it would be sound practice, consistent with the statutory policy of repose, to hold the preliminary hearing and secure a magistrate's determination of probable cause before the statutory period expires. Only then can it be certain that the Government has evidence showing probable cause at hand before the end of the limitation period. And, in an exceptional case, such as the one before us, where the complaint is filed so late that the hearing cannot be held within the limitation period, surely, in order to serve the statutory purpose, the hearing must be held with the same promptness as when \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 229]\n\u00a0\n a defendant is in custody or on bond, even though a summons, rather than an arrest warrant, was issued.\n\nIn this case the complaint was filed the day before the limitation period expired. In accordance with the Government's wishes, the summons was made returnable 30 days later, and, at the Government's subsequent request, the hearing date was postponed an additional week. In my view, to schedule a hearing to be held 36 days after the limitation period expires, when that hearing normally should have been held before the end of the statutory time for prosecution, is not to schedule it within the \"reasonable time\" which the Court itself says is required. Nor can it be said under the circumstances here present that the petitioner waived the right to have the probable cause determination made promptly. Whatever the burden on a defendant may be under other circumstances to move to accelerate a date fixed by a Commissioner upon an ex parte application of the Government, it would be unjust to apply any waiver concept here. Until the holding today there was no authoritative construction that the statute, read in conjunction with the Federal Criminal Rules, entitles the charged defendant to a hearing after issuance of a summons. There is no basis, therefore, for concluding that petitioner, by being silent under these circumstances, knowingly and consciously waived his right to a speedy hearing and determination of whether probable cause existed.\n\nI would conclude that a preliminary hearing, which was to determine whether probable cause existed, was not held within a \"reasonable time\" as Rule 5 requires, and that since the Government did not fulfill all the requirements of this Rule, the complaint did not serve to institute the proper pre-indictment criminal procedure. It therefore, in my view, was not the type of complaint that tolls the statute of limitations under Internal Revenue Code 6531, and petitioner's prosecution should be barred. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWhile it is not necessary, under my view of this case, to determine whether the complaint showed probable cause, since the Court reaches that issue, I believe it appropriate to express my disagreement with its conclusion. If the Court means that the standard of probable cause required for the issuance of a summons directing the defendant to appear for a preliminary hearing is the same as the standard required for issuance of a search warrant or an arrest warrant, which will place the defendant under immediate physical restraint, the complaint before us fails to demonstrate probable cause, for it clearly fails to meet the standards laid down in Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480\n, and Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108\n.\n\nThis Court in Giordenello held that a finding of \"probable cause\" must be made by a \"neutral and detached\" magistrate who \"assess[es] independently the probability that . . . [an accused] committed the crime charged.\" Giordenello v. United States, supra, at 486-487. (Emphasis added.) The Court also stated,\n\n\"The purpose of the complaint . . . is to enable the appropriate magistrate . . . to determine whether the `probable cause' required to support a warrant exists. The Commissioner must judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on by a complaining officer to show probable cause. He should not accept without question the complainant's mere conclusion that the person whose arrest is sought has committed a crime.\" Id., at 486.\n\n\n In order to make an independent determination that probable cause exists, the magistrate must be presented with more than the fact that the affiant or his sources are reliable and the affiant's conclusion that the accused is believed to have committed a crime. As we stated in \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 231]\n\u00a0\n Aguilar v. Texas, supra, at 114, the magistrate or commissioner must also \"be informed of some of the underlying circumstances\" supporting the affiant's belief that the accused has committed a crime. This statement was recently reaffirmed in United States v. Ventresca, \n380 \nU.S. 102, 108\n. To allow a magistrate to find probable cause when a reliable affiant does no more than swear, as the agent did here, that his investigations led him to conclude that petitioner understated his income, is to remove the function of making an independent determination of probable cause from the hands of the magistrate and to place it in the hands of the agent.\n\nThe affidavit presented by the revenue agent in this case does no more than list the agent's sources of information - examination of public and private records and interviews with third persons - and concludes that the petitioner understated his income. Without the slightest indication of what the agent's examinations and interviews revealed, it is impossible for a \"neutral and detached magistrate\" to determine for himself whether probable cause existed. The agent need not set out all the information obtained, but, as we held in Aguilar, some of the underlying facts must be indicated.\n\nI cannot accept the Court's view that the nature of the offense charged in this case excuses the Government from setting out any of the facts underlying the conclusion that the petitioner understated his income. Surely, defendants in criminal tax cases - whether based upon a net worth theory or otherwise - are as entitled to a magistrate's independent determination of \"probable cause\" as any other defendants. Furthermore, I do not believe it impossible, or even very difficult, for the Government to give some indication of the type of information obtained through its perusal of petitioner's books and its interviews with third persons. But I do believe that it is impossible for a magistrate or commissioner to determine \n\n[381 \nU.S. 214, 232]\n\u00a0\n whether probable cause exists without some indication of the facts which led the affiant to his conclusion.\n\nIt is as true of the complaint before us as of the affidavit in Giordenello that \"it is difficult to understand how the Commissioner could be expected to assess independently the probability that petitioner committed the crime charged.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 486\n-487. In my view, Giordenello and Aguilar require that the complaint not only state the ultimate conclusion that petitioner understated his income and set out the sources of information leading to that conclusion, but that it also set out some of the underlying facts upon which that conclusion is based.

Held:\n\n 1. In holding that the ordinance effected a taking of respondent's property right in the airspace above its land without compensation, the State Supreme Court rested its decision upon independent and adequate state grounds, even though it also relied on similar federal grounds, and this Court is therefore deprived of jurisdiction to review the state court judgment.

Tighe, Jr., for the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers; and by John E. Stephen and George S. Laphan, Jr., for the Air Transport Association.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPursuant to a 20-year lease with the City of Gary, Indiana, petitioners are the operators of Gary Municipal Airport, one of the airports included in the National Airport Plan. They seek review of a decision invalidating the city's airport zoning ordinance, which, with regard to buildings and other structures in the immediate vicinity of the airport, prescribes height limitations based upon a 40-to-1 glide angle for approaching aircraft (i. e., at a distance of 40 feet from the end of the planned runway, structures may not exceed one foot in height). After passage of the ordinance, respondent, the Indiana Toll Road Commission, constructed a toll road parallel to the south side of the airport and 443 feet from the end of the planned runway. Contending that at that location the ordinance prescribes a maximum height of 18.08 feet above the surrounding land and that respondent's toll road (which is raised 29.8 feet above the surrounding land surface) violates the ordinance, petitioners brought suit in the Indiana courts for injunctive relief and damages. Although it refused to grant an injunction, the trial court awarded petitioners damages of $164,000 and costs. That judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n Indiana, which concluded that \"the ordinance purported to authorize an unlawful and unconstitutional appropriation of property rights without payment of compensation.\" 244 Ind. 574, 584, 193 N. E. 2d 237, 242. Because it appeared that the case involved the validity of airport zoning regulations under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and therefore presented important questions affecting the National Airport Plan not previously considered by this Court, we granted certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 942\n.\n\nRespondent suggests, however, that we are without jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana because that judgment was based on an independent and adequate state ground. It is undoubtedly\n\n\"`the settled rule that where the judgment of a state court rests upon two grounds, one of which is federal and the other non-federal in character, our jurisdiction fails if the non-federal ground is independent of the federal ground and adequate to support the judgment.' Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207, 210\n.\" Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, \n368 \nU.S. 278, 281\n.\n\n\n As we have concluded that respondent is correct in its contention that the judgment sought to be reviewed is supported by an independent and adequate state ground, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\nIn the Indiana Supreme Court respondent relied on the just compensation requirement of the Indiana Constitution as well as on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Indiana Supreme Court stated the issue for decision as whether \"the ordinance purport[s] to effect a taking of private property for public use in violation of the provisions of Article 1, 21 of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n the Indiana Constitution\n1\n and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\" 244 Ind., at 577, 193 N. E. 2d, at 238. In resolving that issue, however, the Indiana Supreme Court, quite understandably, did not analyze separately the effect of the two provisions but considered them together. From that fact petitioners would have us conclude that the state ground of decision - invalidity of the zoning ordinance under Art. 1, 21, of the Indiana Constitution - \"is so interwoven with the other as not to be an independent matter . . . .\" Enterprise Irrig. District v. Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n (dictum). (Emphasis added.) We cannot agree.\n\nQuoting both Art. 1, 21, of the Indiana Constitution and 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and citing both a decision of this Court, Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393\n, and one of its own decisions, General Outdoor Advertising Co. v. City of Indianapolis, 202 Ind. 85, 172 N. E. 309 (1930), the Indiana Supreme Court began its analysis with the proposition that private property may not be taken for public use without compensation. Two issues were singled out as determinative of whether the ordinance under consideration violated that constitutional protection: \"(1) Whether air space above land is a constitutionally protected property right, and (2) whether in the instant case there has been a constitutionally proscribed taking.\" 244 Ind., at 578, 193 N. E. 2d, at 239.\n\nIn holding that landowners did have a protected property interest in the airspace above their land, the court first discussed an Indiana statute, Acts 1927, c. 43, 3, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n Burns Ind. Stat. Ann. 14-103 (1950 Repl.) (\"The ownership of the space above the lands and waters of this state is declared to be vested in the several owners of the surface beneath, . . .\"), and a prior interpretation of state law, Capitol Airways, Inc. v. Indianapolis P. & L. Co., 215 Ind. 462, 466, 18 N. E. 2d 776, 778 (1939) (airport operator has no right to damages from public utility whose power line obstructs flight into and out of airport). In addition, the Indiana Supreme Court cited and discussed two cases of this Court holding low altitude overflights to constitute a taking of an air easement requiring just compensation under the United States Constitution. Griggs v. Allegheny County, \n369 \nU.S. 84\n; United States v. Causby, \n328 \nU.S. 256\n. But nothing in the court's opinion suggests that its conclusion that \"[i]n the light of the above authorities . . . the reasonable and ordinary use of air space above land is a property right which cannot be taken without the payment of compensation,\" 244 Ind., at 581, 193 N. E. 2d, at 240, flows from a federal rather than a state source. Indeed, the organization and language of the opinion indicates that, at the least, state law is an equal ground of decision.\n\nThe discussion of the second question - whether the ordinance effects a proscribed taking, as opposed to a reasonable regulation under the police power - similarly interlaces Indiana and federal decisions, as well as decisions of other state courts. Again there is no intimation that the conclusion that the ordinance entails \"an unlawful and unconstitutional appropriation of property rights without payment of compensation,\" 244 Ind., at 584, 193 N. E. 2d, at 242, is based less forcefully on the Indiana Constitution than on the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn such circumstances, even though a state court's opinion relies on similar provisions in both the State and Federal Constitutions, the state constitutional provision has been held to provide an independent and adequate \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n ground of decision depriving this Court of jurisdiction to review the state judgment. New York City v. Central Savings Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 661\n, explained in Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551, 556\n-557; Lynch v. New York ex rel. Pierson, \n293 \nU.S. 52\n. This is not a case like those cited by petitioners where the lower court opinion as a whole \"leaves the impression that the court probably felt constrained to rule as it did because of [decisions applying the Fourteenth Amendment],\" Minnesota v. National Tea Co., supra, at 554-555, or \"because it felt under compulsion of federal law as enunciated by this Court so to hold,\" Missouri ex rel. Southern R. Co. v. Mayfield, \n340 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, with the result that the state and federal grounds are \"so interwoven that we are unable to conclude that the judgment rests upon an independent interpretation of the state law,\" State Tax Comm'n v. Van Cott, \n306 \nU.S. 511, 514\n. See also Perkins v. Benguet Mining Co., \n342 \nU.S. 437, 443\n, 448-449; Enterprise Irrig. District v. Canal Co., supra. Under our settled decisions the state ground in this case must be regarded as an independent and adequate ground of decision, and we so hold.\n\nPetitioners nevertheless contend that the state ground of decision is not adequate because it is inconsistent with the policy of the Federal Airport Act, 60 Stat. 170, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. (1958 ed. and Supp. V), and therefore founders on the Supremacy Clause.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n The premises underlying petitioners' argument are that the Federal Airport Act is predicated on a determination by Congress that airport zoning is essential to assure compatible land use in the vicinity of airports without prohibitive cost and that the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court in this case signifies the total nullification of airport zoning. We think the second premise is unfounded. The Indiana Supreme Court had before it a case in which the effect of the ordinance was to establish a maximum height of 18 feet for structures on respondent's land. Although it recognized that zoning regulations may be upheld as a reasonable exercise of the police power \"where the owner of property is merely restricted in the use and enjoyment of his property,\" 244 Ind., at 581, 193 N. E. 2d, at 240-241, the court held that a taking requiring compensation - rather than mere regulation - was effected here because \"the City of Gary has attempted, by the passage of the ordinance under consideration, to take and appropriate to its own use the ordinarily usable air space of property adjacent to the Gary Airport . . . .\" 244 Ind., at 582, 193 N. E. 2d, at 241. (Emphasis added.) As we read the opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court, it certainly does not portend the wholesale invalidation of all airport zoning laws. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n And no substantial claim can be made that Congress intended to preclude such an application of state law as is involved in the present case. On March 11 of last year Congress did indicate its interest in furthering airport zoning when it amended 11 of the Federal Airport Act to require as an additional condition of approval of an airport project seeking federal aid that:\n\n \"(4) appropriate action, including the adoption of zoning laws, has been or will be taken, to the extent reasonable, to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and take-off of aircraft.\" P. L. 88-280, 1964 U.S. Code Cong. & Adm. News 514. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n That requirement, however, is presently implemented by the Federal Aviation Agency by obtaining an assurance from the project sponsor that he will prevent the construction of obstructions to air navigation \"either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations.\" Form FAA-1624, Part III 7, Sponsor Assurances. And amounts expended to acquire \"land or interests therein or easements through or other interests in air space\" are among \"the allowable project costs\" that may be recompensed under 13 of the Federal Airport Act, 60 Stat. 177, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1112 (a) (2) (1958 ed., Supp. V). Appearing as amicus curiae, the United States affirms that \"[t]here is no basis for a contention that federal law removes State law restrictions on the exercise of the zoning power or defeats any State law right to compensation.\" We conclude that the decision of the Supreme \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 495]\n\u00a0\n Court of Indiana in this case is compatible with the congressional policy embodied in the Federal Airport Act.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Art. 1, 21, Ind. Const.:\n\n\"No man's particular services shall be demanded, without just compensation. No man's property shall be taken by law, without just compensation; nor, except in case of the State, without such compensation first assessed and tendered.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioners' pre-emption argument is not pressed in their petition for certiorari as a separate issue for review but only as bearing on the adequacy of the state ground of decision. Nor have petitioners demonstrated that this issue was presented to the Indiana Supreme Court. In this regard petitioners quote that court's statement that \"[t]he federal government has recognized the requirement that easements for the glide angle needed for landing and take-off must be acquired by condemnation proceedings and payment of just compensation,\" 244 Ind., at 584, 193 N. E. 2d, at 242, but that conclusion \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n was based on two cases condemning easements over property adjoining federal bases that were decided several years before the recent amendment to the Federal Airport Act, United States v. 48.10 Acres of Land, 144 F. Supp. 258 (D.C. S. D. N. Y. 1956); United States v. 4.43 Acres of Land, 137 F. Supp. 567 (D.C. N. D. Tex. 1956), not on any assessment of the policy of that Act. These circumstances of course bar petitioners from seeking reversal of the judgment below on the basis of their pre-emption claim, and it is therefore questionable whether petitioners may advance the same argument under the guise of an attack on the adequacy of the state ground of decision. We need not consider this problem further, however, because, as is explained in the text, infra, the pre-emption claim is insubstantial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Needless to say, we express no opinion in this case regarding the validity under the United States Constitution of the city's airport zoning ordinance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\nAlthough the opinion of the Supreme Court of Indiana relies on state and federal precedents, I can find nowhere in its opinion any clear indication of whether that court's ultimate conclusion is based upon the Federal Constitution, the Constitution of Indiana, or both. Therefore, I think the posture of this case is identical to that presented in Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551\n, and that we should, as the Court did there, vacate the judgment of the State Supreme Court and remand the cause for further proceedings.\n\n\"It is important that this Court not indulge in needless dissertations on constitutional law. It is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions. But it is equally important that ambiguous or obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers to a determination by this Court of the validity under the federal constitution of state action. Intelligent exercise of our appellate powers compels us to ask for the elimination of the obscurities and ambiguities from the opinions in such cases. Only then can we ascertain whether or not our jurisdiction to review should be invoked. Only by that procedure can the responsibility for striking down or upholding state legislation be fairly placed. For no other course \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 496]\n\u00a0\n assures that important federal issues, such as have been argued here, will reach this Court for adjudication; that state courts will not be the final arbiters of important issues under the federal constitution; and that we will not encroach on the constitutional jurisdiction of the states. This is not a mere technical rule nor a rule for our convenience. It touches the division of authority between state courts and this Court and is of equal importance to each. Only by such explicitness can the highest courts of the states and this Court keep within the bounds of their respective jurisdictions.\" \n309 \nU.S., at 557\n. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 487, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJENKINS v.

The Solicitor General in his brief in this Court stated:\n\n\"Of course, if this Court should conclude that the judge's statement had the coercive effect attributed to it, the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial; the principle that jurors may not be coerced into surrendering views conscientiously held is so clear as to require no elaboration.\"\n\n\n Upon review of the record, we conclude that in its context and under all the circumstances the judge's statement had the coercive effect attributed to it.

JUSTICE STEWART join, concurring.\n\nThe California Constitution reserves to the people of the State the initiative power to propose constitutional amendments by filing a petition with the Secretary of State.\n1\n If the petition is signed by 8% of the persons who voted in the preceding gubernatorial election, the proposed amendment will be submitted to the people at the next general election, and only a bare majority vote of the people is required in order to pass the amendment.\n\nPrior to 1926 the California Constitution, Art. IV, 6, provided that both houses of the legislature would be apportioned on the basis of population.\n2\n In 1926 an \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n initiative measure, known as Proposition 28, was submitted to the voters which deleted the requirement that the Senate be apportioned on a strict population basis, leaving the method of apportioning the Assembly unaffected.\n3\n The statements accompanying the measure, which were distributed to all voters, described the proposition as an attempt to provide a federal-type plan for California, similar to the apportionment of the United States Congress, and summarized the arguments pro and con the proposal.\n4\n Proposition 28 was approved by a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n popular vote of 437,003 to 363,208 in the November 1926 election, and the following year the legislature adopted apportionment statutes to effectuate the constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n amendment. This legislation was submitted to the people as required by state law, and was approved by them in the 1928 election.\n5\n The amendment provided that the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n Senate would be composed of 40 members, to be elected from senatorial districts; the districts would be based on population, but no county could contain more than one district, and no district could consist of more than three counties.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nSince the adoption of these changes, various initiative measures have been submitted to the voters on more than one occasion in an attempt to change this apportionment system for the Senate. In 1948 such a proposition was defeated by a vote of 2,250,937 to 1,069,899.\n7\n In 1960 such a proposition was defeated by a vote of 3,408,090 to 1,876,185.\n8\n And in 1962 another such proposition was defeated by a vote of 2,495,440 to 2,181,758.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court today summarily affirms the decree of the District Court holding this senatorial apportionment, consistently approved by a majority of the people of California voting in general elections, to be invalid under the decisions of this Court in Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, and companion cases. Were I able to detect in any of those cases the slightest basis for optimism that the Court might consider last Term's reapportionment pronouncements to leave room for the people of a State to choose for themselves the kind of legislative structure they wish to have - at least when the democratic processes employed are as straightforward and flexible as those of California - I would vote to \"Note\" and hear this case. Finding, however, that the judgment of the District Court is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n squarely required by Lucas v. Forty-fourth General Assembly, \n377 \nU.S. 713\n,\n10\n I reluctantly acquiesce in the Court's summary affirmance.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Calif. Const., Art. IV, 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"For the purpose of choosing members of the legislature, the state shall be divided into forty senatorial and eighty assembly districts, as nearly equal in population as may be, and composed of contiguous \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n territory, to be called senatorial and assembly districts.\" Calif.

Laws 1927, p. lxxxv.\n\nAnother measure, Proposition 20, was also submitted to the voters in the 1926 election, which would have preserved the apportionment of both houses on a strict population basis. This proposition was defeated by a vote of 492,923 to 319,456. Record 37.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Argument in Favor of Legislative Reapportionment Initiative     Measure.\n\n    \"`FEDERAL PLAN.'\n\n\n\"This proposed constitutional amendment will take the place of section 6, article 4, of the constitution of California, which now provides that the state shall be divided into forty senatorial districts and eighty assembly districts `as nearly equal in population as may be, and composed of contiguous territory.'\n\n\n\"The growth of city population in California, and particularly the unprecedented development of the two great urban regions of the state, will have the effect, if representation is reapportioned according to present law, of consolidating political power in the inhabitants of 3 per cent of the area of the state to the prejudice of the representative \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n rights of the balance of the population who inhabit 97 per cent of the area of the state. The state legislature, foreseeing disadvantages to the general interests of the state, has repeatedly declined, since the publication of the last federal census, to reapportion representation on the basis of the existing law.\n\n\n\"The present amendment would alter the constitution so as to enable the legislature to find a solution to the difficulty that will protect the right of the great bulk of the state to fair representation.\n\n\n\"The plan is called the `Federal Plan' because its provisions resemble those of the federal constitution with respect to representation in the United States congress. It rests upon a principle widely recognized in American government and other governments that representation in a public assembly is equitably apportioned not according to population alone but according to two factors - population and territory.\n\n\n\"The measure will preserve to rural California and the great agricultural producing areas which comprise it, the control of one house of the state legislature, namely: the senate. The measure makes no change in assembly districts. It does not increase the members of the legislature. It can not, in any way, add to state expense.\n\n\n\"Under this plan no county or city and county has more than one senator. The small counties are grouped, but are given at least one senator to each three counties. There are fifty-eight counties in the state and forty senators. To illustrate the working of the plan, twenty-seven of these counties might, by reason of superior population, each elect one senator; sixteen counties grouped in twos might elect eight; and fifteen counties grouped in threes might elect five. Every large homogeneous geographical area of the state is assured one representative in the senate.\n\n\n\"Twenty-nine states of the Union have based their legislative representation in some form upon this principle, and these states include, among others, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Iowa, and Ohio. The principle was submitted to a popular election in Ohio in 1903, and was overwhelmingly adopted by 731,000 votes for it and only 26,479 votes against the principle. This amendment is sponsored by the California Farm Bureau Federation, the State Grange, the Farmers Union, and the Agricultural Legislative Committee. But it is also supported by chambers of commerce, women's clubs, and civic organizations generally throughout the state. It will \n\n[381 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n create a well-balanced legislature in which neither the cities nor the countryside may predominate. It is a just and wholesome provision. It will give the state a better legislature than is possible under present law, and will be a fair determination of a controversy disturbing to the best interests of California.\n\n\n\"Vote YES on this amendment.\n\n      \"DAVID P. BARROWS.\n\n\n\n\"Argument Against Legislative Reapportionment Initiative    Measure.\n\n\n\"The proposed amendment is unfair and impractical so far as it relates to senatorial districts.\n\n\n\"The provision that no county or city and county shall contain more than one senatorial district would limit Alameda, Los Angeles and San Francisco to one senator each. These three combined have 200,000 more than half of the population of the state, so the result would be that the majority would have only three senators, and the minority would be represented by thirty-seven senators. There is no good reason for the discrimination.\n\n\n\"The agricultural and commercial interests are so closely allied and interwoven that neither one as such should have the greater power in legislation. The only fair way is to base the representation on population, in accordance with the fundamental principles of our government that the majority shall rule.\n\n\n\"The amendment prescribes no method of determining how the senatorial districts shall be formed. It merely provides that counties of small population shall be grouped in districts of not more than three counties in one district. It is left to the legislature or reapportionment commission to determine arbitrarily and without restriction how it shall be done. Many of the counties of small population are contiguous, so it will follow that sparsely settled districts must be formed, and even the agricultural sections will not have equal representation in the senate as among themselves.\n\n\n\"The populous counties pay the greater share of taxes, and should have the controlling voice in the expenditure of the state's funds.\n\n\n\"If the citizens of these centers should vote for this amendment they would help to disfranchise themselves.\n\n\n\"Vote NO and preserve American principles.\n\n      \"DANA R. WELLER.\" Record 54.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Record 37. The vote was 692, 347 in favor, and 570,120 opposed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Calif. Const., Art. IV, 6. The present effect of this apportionment is that Los Angeles County, with a population of over 6,000,000, has one Senator, and the three smallest counties, which together have a population of 14,294, also have one Senator. There is no claim made, however, that the Assembly is not apportioned solely on the basis of population.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Proposition 13 on the 1948 ballot.

BROWN(1965)\nNo. 37\nArgued: January 19, 1965Decided: March 29, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondents were members of a multiemployer bargaining group with a history of successful bargaining. After the union struck another member of the group, which continued operations using temporary replacements, respondents locked out their employees and utilized temporary replacements to continue business operations. The National Labor Relations Board found that, while the use of temporary replacements by the struck employer was lawful, the lockout of regular employees and their temporary replacement by respondents violated 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The Court of Appeals disagreed and refused to enforce the Board's order. Held:\n\n 1. Although the Board need not inquire into employer motivation to support a finding of an unfair labor practice where the employer's conduct is demonstrably destructive of employee rights and is not justified by the service of significant or important business ends, respondents' lockout and subsequent operations with temporary help in the face of the struck employer's continued operations during the whipsaw strike do not constitute such conduct. Pp. 282-286.\n\n\n  (a) Since the struck employer continued to operate, respondents might reasonably have been concerned that the integrity of the employer group was threatened unless they managed to stay open during the lockout. P. 284.\n\n\n  (b) Respondents' continued operations with the use of temporary employees after the lockout was wholly consistent with a legitimate business purpose. P. 285.\n\n\n  (c) Respondents' use of temporary replacements rather than some of their regular employees does not justify an inference of hostile motivation; to limit the respondents to the use of regular employees under the circumstances here present would be to render largely illusory the right of lockout recognized by Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n. P. 285. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 279]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (d) Absent evidentiary findings of hostile motive there is no support for a conclusion that respondents violated 8 (a) (1) of the Act. P. 286.\n\n\n 2. Indispensable to a violation of 8 (a) (3) is a determination that the employer's actions were motivated by an unlawful intent, and while no specific evidence of this unlawful intent is necessary when an employer practice is inherently destructive of employee rights and is not justified by legitimate business reasons, where as here, the tendency to discourage membership is comparatively slight, and the employer's conduct is reasonably adapted to achieve legitimate business ends, the improper intent of the employer must be established by independent evidence. Not only is the record devoid of any evidence that respondents acted with an improper intent, but it contains positive evidence of their good faith. Pp. 286-290.\n\n\n 3. While courts should be slow to overturn an administrative decision, they are not left to sheer acceptance of the Board's conclusions, and must set aside a Board decision which rests on an erroneous legal foundation.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondents, who are members of a multiemployer bargaining group, locked out their employees in response \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n to a whipsaw strike against another member of the group. They and the struck employer continued operations with temporary replacements. The National Labor Relations Board found that the struck employer's use of temporary replacements was lawful under Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, but that the respondents had violated 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act\n1\n by locking out their regular employees and using temporary replacements to carry on business. 137 N. L. R. B. 73. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit disagreed and refused to enforce the Board's order. 319 F.2d 7. We granted certiorari, \n375 \nU.S. 962\n. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\n\nFive operators of six retail food stores in Carlsbad, New Mexico, make up the employer group. The stores had bargained successfully on a group basis for many years with Local 462 of the Retail Clerks International Association. Negotiations for a new collective-bargaining agreement to replace the expiring one began in January 1960. Agreement was reached by mid-February on all \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n terms except the amount and effective date of a wage increase. Bargaining continued without result, and on March 2 the Local informed the employers that a strike had been authorized. The employers responded that a strike against any member of the employer group would be regarded as a strike against all. On March 16, the union struck Food Jet, Inc., one of the group. The four respondents, operating five stores, immediately locked out all employees represented by the Local, telling them and the Local that they would be recalled to work when the strike against Food Jet ended. The stores, including Food Jet, continued to carry on business by using management personnel, relatives of such personnel, and a few temporary employees; all of the temporary replacements were expressly told that the arrangement would be discontinued when the whipsaw strike ended.\n2\n Bargaining continued until April 22 when an agreement was reached. The employers immediately released the temporary replacements and restored the strikers and the locked-out employees to their jobs.\n\nThe Board and the Court of Appeals agreed that the case was to be decided in light of our decision in the so-called Buffalo Linen case, Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n. There we sustained the Board's finding that, in the absence of specific proof of unlawful motivation, the use of a lockout by members of a multiemployer bargaining unit in response to a whipsaw strike did \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n not violate either 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3). We held that, although the lockout tended to impair the effectiveness of the whipsaw strike, the right to strike \"is not so absolute as to deny self-help by employers when legitimate interests of employees and employers collide. . . . The ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 96\n. We concluded that the Board correctly balanced those interests in upholding the lockout, since it found that the nonstruck employers resorted to the lockout to preserve the multiemployer bargaining unit from the disintegration threatened by the whipsaw strike. But in the present case the Board held, two members dissenting, that the respondents' continued operations with temporary replacements constituted a \"critical difference\" from Buffalo Linen - where all members of the employer group shut down operations - and that in this circumstance it was reasonable to infer that the respondents did not act to protect the multiemployer group, but \"for the purpose of inhibiting a lawful strike.\" 137 N. L. R. B., at 76. Thus the respondents' act was both a coercive practice condemned by 8 (a) (1) and discriminatory conduct in violation of 8 (a) (3).\n\nThe Board's decision does not rest upon independent evidence that the respondents acted either out of hostility toward the Local or in reprisal for the whipsaw strike. It rests upon the Board's appraisal that the respondents' conduct carried its own indicia of unlawful intent, thereby establishing, without more, that the conduct constituted an unfair labor practice. It was disagreement with this appraisal, which we share, that led the Court of Appeals to refuse to enforce the Board's order.\n\nIt is true that the Board need not inquire into employer motivation to support a finding of an unfair labor practice where the employer conduct is demonstrably destructive of employee rights and is not justified by the service of significant or important business ends. See, e. g., Labor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n; Labor Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., \n379 \nU.S. 21\n. We agree with the Court of Appeals that, in the setting of this whipsaw strike and Food Jet's continued operations, the respondents' lockout and their continued operations with the use of temporary replacements, viewed separately or as a single act, do not constitute such conduct.\n\nWe begin with the proposition that the Act does not constitute the Board as an \"arbiter of the sort of economic weapons the parties can use in seeking to gain acceptance of their bargaining demands.\" Labor Board v. Insurance Agents, \n361 \nU.S. 477, 497\n. In the absence of proof of unlawful motivation, there are many economic weapons which an employer may use that either interfere in some measure with concerted employee activities, or which are in some degree discriminatory and discourage union membership, and yet the use of such economic weapons does not constitute conduct that is within the prohibition of either 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3). See, e. g., Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., supra; Labor Board v. Dalton Brick & Tile Corp., 301 F.2d 886, 896. Even the Board concedes that an employer may legitimately blunt the effectiveness of an anticipated strike by stockpiling inventories, readjusting contract schedules, or transferring work from one plant to another, even if he thereby makes himself \"virtually strikeproof.\"\n3\n As a general matter he may completely liquidate his business without violating either 8 (a) (1) or 8 (a) (3), whatever the impact of his action on concerted employee activities. Texile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., Nos. 37 and 41, decided today, ante, p. 263. Specifically, he may in various circumstances use the lockout as a legitimate economic weapon. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Truck \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 284]\n\u00a0\n Drivers Union, supra; Labor Board v. Dalton Brick & Tile Corp., supra; Leonard v. Labor Board, 205 F.2d 355; Betts Cadillac Olds, Inc., 96 N. L. R. B. 268; International Shoe Co., 93 N. L. R. B. 907; Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., 72 N. L. R. B. 601, 602; Duluth Bottling Assn., 48 N. L. R. B. 1335; Link-Belt Co., 26 N. L. R. B. 227. And in American Ship Building Co. v. Labor Board, No. 255, decided today, post, p. 300, we hold that a lockout is not an unfair labor practice simply because used by an employer to bring pressure to bear in support of his bargaining position after an impasse in bargaining negotiations has been reached.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, we do not see how the continued operations of respondents and their use of temporary replacements imply hostile motivation any more than the lockout itself; nor do we see how they are inherently more destructive of employee rights. Rather, the compelling inference is that this was all part and parcel of respondents' defensive measure to preserve the multiemployer group in the face of the whipsaw strike. Since Food Jet legitimately continued business operations, it is only reasonable to regard respondents' action as evincing concern that the integrity of the employer group was threatened unless they also managed to stay open for business during the lockout. For with Food Jet open for business and respondents' stores closed, the prospect that the whipsaw strike would succeed in breaking up the employer association was not at all fanciful. The retail food industry is very competitive and repetitive patronage is highly important. Faced with the prospect of a loss of patronage to Food Jet, it is logical that respondents should have been concerned that one or more of their number might bolt the group and come to terms with the Local, thus destroying the common front essential to multiemployer bargaining. The Court of Appeals correctly pictured the respondents' dilemma in saying, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 285]\n\u00a0\n \"If . . . the struck employer does choose to operate with replacements and the other employers cannot replace after lockout, the economic advantage passes to the struck member, the non-struck members are deterred in exercising the defensive lockout, and the whipsaw strike . . . enjoys an almost inescapable prospect of success.\" 319 F.2d, at 11. Clearly respondents' continued operations with the use of temporary replacements following the lockout were wholly consistent with a legitimate business purpose.\n\nNor are we persuaded by the Board's argument that justification for the inference of hostile motivation appears in the respondents' use of temporary employees rather than some of the regular employees. It is not commonsense, we think, to say that the regular employees were \"willing to work at the employers' terms.\" 137 N. L. R. B., at 76. It seems probable that this \"willingness\" was motivated as much by their understandable desire to further the objective of the whipsaw strike - to break through the employers' united front by forcing Food Jet to accept the Local's terms - as it was by a desire to work for the employers under the existing unacceptable terms. As the Board's dissenting members put it, \"These employees are willing only to receive wages while their brethren in the rest of the associationwide unit are exerting whipsaw pressure on one employer to gain benefits that will ultimately accrue to all employees in the associationwide unit, including those here locked out.\" 137 N. L. R. B., at 78. Moreover, the course of action to which the Board would limit the respondents would force them into the position of aiding and abetting the success of the whipsaw strike and consequently would render \"largely illusory,\" 137 N. L. R. B., at 78-79, the right of lockout recognized by Buffalo Linen; the right would be meaningless if barred to nonstruck stores that find it necessary to operate because the struck store does so. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Board's finding of a 8 (a) (1) violation emphasized the impact of respondents' conduct upon the effectiveness of the whipsaw strike. It is no doubt true that the collective strength of the stores to resist that strike is maintained, and even increased, when all stores stay open with temporary replacements. The pressures on the employees are necessarily greater when none of the union employees is working and the stores remain open. But these pressures are no more than the result of the Local's inability to make effective use of the whipsaw tactic. Moreover, these effects are no different from those that result from the legitimate use of any economic weapon by an employer. Continued operations with the use of temporary replacements may result in the failure of the whipsaw strike, but this does not mean that the employers' conduct is demonstrably so destructive of employee rights and so devoid of significant service to any legitimate business end that it cannot be tolerated consistently with the Act. Certainly then, in the absence of evidentiary findings of hostile motive, there is no support for the conclusion that respondents violated 8 (a) (1).\n\nNor does the record show any basis for concluding that respondents violated 8 (a) (3). Under that section both discrimination and a resulting discouragement of union membership are necessary, but the added element of unlawful intent is also required. In Buffalo Linen itself the employers treated the locked-out employees less favorably because of their union membership, and this may have tended to discourage continued membership, but we rejected the notion that the use of the lockout violated the statute. The discriminatory act is not by itself unlawful unless intended to prejudice the employees' position because of their membership in the union; some element of antiunion animus is necessary. See Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17, 42\n-44; Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 287]\n\u00a0\n \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, at 46. We have determined that the \"real motive\" of the employer in an alleged 8 (a) (3) violation is decisive, Associated Press v. Labor Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103, 132\n; if any doubt still persisted, we laid it to rest in Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, supra, where we reviewed the legislative history of the provision and concluded that Congress clearly intended the employer's purpose in discriminating to be controlling. Id., at 44. See also Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., ante, at 275, 276; American Ship Building Co. v. Labor Board, post, at 311-313; Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Labor Board, \n365 \nU.S. 667, 674\n-676.\n\nWe recognize that, analogous to the determination of unfair practices under 8 (a) (1), when an employer practice is inherently destructive of employee rights and is not justified by the service of important business ends, no specific evidence of intent to discourage union membership is necessary to establish a violation of 8 (a) (3). This principle, we have said, is \"but an application of the common-law rule that a man is held to intend the foreseeable consequences of his conduct.\" Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, supra, at 45. For example, in Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, we held that an employer's action in awarding superseniority to employees who worked during a strike was discriminatory conduct that carried with it its own indicia of improper intent. The only reasonable inference that could be drawn by the Board from the award of superseniority - balancing the prejudicial effect upon the employees against any asserted business purpose - was that it was directed against the striking employees because of their union membership; conduct so inherently destructive of employee interests could not be saved from illegality by an asserted overriding business purpose pursued in good faith. But where, as here, the tendency to discourage union membership is comparatively slight, and the employers' \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 288]\n\u00a0\n conduct is reasonably adapted to achieve legitimate business ends or to deal with business exigencies, we enter into an area where the improper motivation of the employers must be established by independent evidence. When so established, antiunion motivation will convert an otherwise ordinary business act into an unfair labor practice. Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, at 227, and cases there cited.\n\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that respondents' conduct here clearly fits into the latter category, where actual subjective intent is determinative, and where the Board must find from evidence independent of the mere conduct involved that the conduct was primarily motivated by an antiunion animus. While the use of temporary nonunion personnel in preference to the locked-out union members is discriminatory, we think that any resulting tendency to discourage union membership is comparatively remote, and that this use of temporary personnel constitutes a measure reasonably adapted to the effectuation of a legitimate business end. Here discontent on the part of the Local's membership in all likelihood is attributable largely to the fact that the membership was locked out as the result of the Local's whipsaw stratagem. But the lockout itself is concededly within the rule of Buffalo Linen. We think that the added dissatisfaction, with its resultant pressure on membership, attributable to the fact that the nonstruck employers remain in business with temporary replacements is comparatively insubstantial. First, the replacements were expressly used for the duration of the labor dispute only; thus, the displaced employees could not have looked upon the replacements as threatening their jobs. At most the union would be forced to capitulate and return its members to work on terms which, while not as desirable as hoped for, were still better than under the old contract. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 289]\n\u00a0\n Second, the membership, through its control of union policy, could end the dispute and terminate the lockout at any time simply by agreeing to the employers' terms and returning to work on a regular basis. Third, in light of the union-shop provision that had been carried forward into the new contract from the old collective-bargaining agreement, it would appear that a union member would have nothing to gain, and much to lose, by quitting the union. Under all these circumstances, we cannot say that the employers' conduct had any great tendency to discourage union membership. Not only was the prospect of discouragement of membership comparatively remote, but the respondents' attempt to remain open for business with the help of temporary replacements was a measure reasonably adapted to the achievement of a legitimate end - preserving the integrity of the multi-employer bargaining unit.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the resulting harm to employee rights is thus comparatively slight, and a substantial and legitimate business end is served, the employers' conduct is prima facie lawful. Under these circumstances the finding of an unfair labor practice under 8 (a) (3) requires a showing of improper subjective intent. Here, there is no assertion by either the union or the Board that the respondents were motivated by antiunion animus, nor is there any evidence that this was the case. On the contrary, the background of the employer association's relations with the union and all the circumstances of the respondents' behavior during the dispute tend to support the contrary conclusion: the history of labor relations between the employers and the Local divulges that the relationship has always been more than amicable; \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 290]\n\u00a0\n union-shop provisions have been incorporated in the collective-bargaining agreement between the Local and the employers for many years; in these very negotiations, the employers' association waived the failure of the Local to give timely notice of its desire to bargain over new terms of employment and consented to hear the Local's claims at the bargaining table; the record contains undisputed testimony by the store owners that they had no bone to pick with the Local, that on the contrary they thought that unions were a good thing, but felt forced to take action in order to preserve the multiemployer group from disintegration and to save their considerable stock of perishable food produce. Even the struck member of the association did not resort to permanent replacements for the striking workers, though it could have under Mackay; rather it sought to ride out the dispute with temporary replacements to avoid depriving the regular employees of their jobs. Thus, not only is there absent in the record any independent evidence of improper motive, but the record contains positive evidence of the employers' good faith. In sum, the Court of Appeals was required to conclude that there was not sufficient evidence gathered from the record as a whole to support the Board's finding that respondents' conduct violates 8 (a) (3). See Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n.\n\nIt is argued, finally, that the Board's decision is within the area of its expert judgment and that, in setting it aside, the Court of Appeals exceeded the authorized scope of judicial review. This proposition rests upon our statement in Buffalo Linen that in reconciling the conflicting interests of labor and management the Board's determination is to be subjected to \"limited judicial review.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 96\n. When we used the phrase \"limited judicial review\" we did not mean that the balance struck by the Board is immune from judicial examination and reversal \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 291]\n\u00a0\n in proper cases.\n5\n Courts are expressly empowered to enforce, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, the Board's orders, except that the findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 10 (e), (f), 29 U.S.C. 160 (e), (f) (1958 ed.). Courts should be \"slow to overturn an administrative decision,\" Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., \n351 \nU.S. 105, 112\n, but they are not left \"to `sheer acceptance' of the Board's conclusions,\" Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793, 803\n. Reviewing courts are not obliged to stand aside and rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute. Such review is always properly within the judicial province, and courts would abdicate their \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 292]\n\u00a0\n responsibility if they did not fully review such administrative decisions. Of course due deference is to be rendered to agency determinations of fact, so long as there is substantial evidence to be found in the record as a whole. But where, as here, the review is not of a question of fact, but of a judgment as to the proper balance to be struck between conflicting interests, \"[t]he deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia which results in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress.\" American Ship Building Co. v. Labor Board, post, at 318.\n\nCourts must, of course, set aside Board decisions which rest on an \"erroneous legal foundation.\" Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., supra, at 112-113. Congress has not given the Board untrammelled authority to catalogue which economic devices shall be deemed freighted with indicia of unlawful intent. Labor Board v. Insurance Agents, supra, at 498. In determining here that the respondents' conduct carried its own badge of improper motive, the Board's decision, for the reasons stated, misapplied the criteria governing the application of 8 (a) (1) and (3). Since the order therefore rested on an erroneous legal foundation, the Court of Appeals properly refused to enforce it.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 8 (a), 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1958 ed.) provides: \"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer - \"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title; .   .   .   .   . \"(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization . . . .\" National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 7, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 157 (1958 ed.) provides: \"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Food Jet used supervisory personnel and hired some \"sack boys\"; respondent Safeway Stores, which operated two stores in Carlsbad, closed one and transferred its managerial personnel to the other; respondent Thrifty Way Food Stores used management personnel and their wives and also hired some part-time \"box boys\"; respondent Brown Food Store relied on management personnel and their relatives, and a \"sack boy\" transferred from an out-of-town branch store; respondent Cashway Food Stores also relied on management personnel and their relatives and some transferees from out-of-town branches.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See brief for the National Labor Relations Board in American Ship Building Co. v.

In Labor Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., \n351 \nU.S. 105\n, we set aside, as resting on an erroneous legal foundation, a Board decision finding that the employer's refusal to allow distribution of union literature on a company-owned parking lot violated 8 (a) (1). In Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n, we sustained the Board's decision but emphasized that judicial review is contemplated by 29 U.S.C. 160 (e), (f), \n324 \nU.S., at 799\n. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177\n, involved a question of remedy as to which the statute expressly grants the Board broad authority, 29 U.S.C. 160 (c). Since Buffalo Linen numerous Board orders have been set aside as outside of the Board's statutory authority. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Insurance Agents, \n361 \nU.S. 477\n; Labor Board v. Drivers Local Union, \n362 \nU.S. 274\n; Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Labor Board, \n365 \nU.S. 667\n; Labor Board v. Fruit Packers, \n377 \nU.S. 58\n. Even where the Board is sustained, its analysis in support of its conclusion is subjected to full, independent judicial review. See Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] We do not here decide whether the case would be the same had the struck employer exercised its prerogative to hire permanent replacements for the strikers under our rule in Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, and the nonstruck employers had then hired permanent replacements for their locked-out employees.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\nI agree with the Court that, given the Buffalo Linen case, Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 293]\n\u00a0\n and applying it in light of the actualities of industrial relations, the employers' conduct here is shown to be justified and necessary to preserve the integrity of the employers' bargaining unit. After the union attempted a whipsaw strike against one member of the multiemployer bargaining unit, the other members locked out their employees. The struck employer attempted to carry on business by using management personnel, relatives of such personnel, and a few temporary employees. To avoid the whipsaw effect of the strike, the nonstruck employers then did the same. During the period of the lockout, all of the employers, struck as well as nonstruck, bargained with the union and, when agreement was reached, in all cases the temporary employees were dismissed and the union employees returned to their jobs.\n\nAs the Court seems to recognize, ante, p. 292, n. 6, this would be an entirely different case had the nonstruck employers locked out their employees and hired permanent replacements even if the struck employer had exercised his right to hire permanent replacements under the doctrine of Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n. If the Labor Board determined in such a case that the interference with employee rights was not justified by the legitimate economic interests of the employer, the Labor Board determination might well be controlling. See my concurring opinion in American Ship Building Co. v. Labor Board, post, at 327. Cf. Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n. There would be grave doubts as to whether the act of locking out employees and hiring permanent replacements is justified by any legitimate interest of the nonstruck employers, for Buffalo Linen makes clear that the test in such a situation is not whether parity is achieved between struck and nonstruck employers, but, rather, whether the nonstruck employers' actions are necessary to counteract the whipsaw effects of the strike and to preserve the employer \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 294]\n\u00a0\n bargaining unit. Since in this case the nonstruck employers did nothing more than hire temporary replacements, an activity necessary to counter whipsawing by the union and to preserve the bargaining unit, I agree that, applying Buffalo Linen, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.\n\nI cannot agree with the severe restrictions which the Court imposes on the Board's role in determining the employer conduct banned by 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the NLRA. This Court has long recognized that \"[a] statute expressive of such large public policy as that on which the National Labor Relations Board is based must be broadly phrased and necessarily carries with it the task of administrative application,\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 194\n, and has repeatedly held that the Board may find some conduct sufficiently destructive of concerted activities and union membership as to fall within the broad language of 8 (a) (1) and (3) notwithstanding that the employer has a business justification for his actions. Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n; Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n (Buffalo Linen); Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221\n; Labor Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., \n379 \nU.S. 21\n. The Board holds that a lockout together with the hiring of replacements by the nonstruck employers of a multiemployer bargaining unit violates 8 (a) (1) and (3). The Court decides that this holding is an \"unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress,\" ante, at 292, and that the \"proper balance to be struck between conflicting interests\" requires affirmance of the denial of enforcement of the Board's order. This decision represents a departure from the many decisions of this Court holding that the Board has primary responsibility to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 295]\n\u00a0\n weigh the interest of employees in concerted activities against that of the employer in operating his business, Phelps Dodge, \n313 \nU.S. 177\n; Buffalo Linen, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 95\n; Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S. 221\n; Burnup & Sims, \n379 \nU.S. 21\n. The Board's discretion under these sections is not without substantial limits imposed by the policy of the Act and the requirement that the Board \"disclose the basis of its order\" and \"give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.\" Phelps Dodge, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n; cf. Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 156, 168\n. But in my view the Board has set out the basis and requisite findings for its order in this case and has not exceeded its power in finding the lockout and replacement of union employees an unfair labor practice.\n\nThe Court reasons that Buffalo Linen gave the non-struck employer in a multiemployer unit a \"right\" to lock out whenever a member of the unit is struck so that a parity of economic advantage or disadvantage between the struck and nonstruck employers can be maintained. In order to maintain parity where the struck employer hires replacements, the nonstruck employers must also be free to hire replacements, lest the right to lock out to protect the unit be illusory. And they need not offer these jobs to the locked-out employees desiring to work, lest the parity between the struck and nonstruck employers be lost and the right to lock out be meaningless. If this reasoning is sound, the nonstruck employers can not only lock out employees who belong to the union because of their union membership but also hire permanent as well as temporary nonunion replacements whenever the struck employer hires such replacements, for parity may well so require. But I cannot accept this reasoning.\n\nOne, Buffalo Linen established no unqualified \"right\" of employers in a multiemployer unit to lock out. Rather it held that the Board was well within the policy and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 296]\n\u00a0\n language of the Act in finding no unfair labor practice in the nonstruck members' ceasing operations after the union had successfully shut down the operations of one of the employers. Although a departure from the Board's general ban on lockouts because of their severe effect on protected employee rights, the Board found such a lockout justified by the union-imposed pressure on the employer unit where one employer could not operate and the others maintained full operations. The Board decided that the Act did not require the employers to contribute to this pressure by maintaining full operations.\n\nTwo, the threat to the integrity of the multiemployer unit, the consideration that was decisive in Buffalo Linen, is obviously very different where the struck employer continues operations with replacements; it certainly cannot be assumed that the struck employer operating with replacements is at the same disadvantage vis-a-vis the nonstruck employers as the employer in Buffalo Linen whose operations were totally shut down by the union. Indeed, there was no showing here that the struck employer was substantially disadvantaged at all, and the Board found that there was \"no economic necessity . . . for the other members shutting down.\" 137 N. L. R. B. 73, at 77. The Court makes irrelevant the consideration that justified the lockout in Buffalo Linen - the effect of the single employer strike on the unit - on the faulty premise that Buffalo Linen established the nonstruck members' right to lock out. Neither the Board nor this Court said the right to lock out ineluctably follows from a single employer strike.\n\nThree, the disparity between the struck employer who resumes operations and the nonstruck employers who choose to lock out to maintain a united front is caused by the unilateral action of one of the employer members of the unit and not by the union's whipsawing tactic. The integrity of the multiemployer unit may be important, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 297]\n\u00a0\n but surely that consideration cannot justify employer tandem action destructive of concerted activity.\n\nFour, the Court asserts that the right of nonstruck employers to hire temporary replacements, and to refuse to hire union men, is but a concomitant of the right to lock out to preserve the multiemployer group. This sanctification of the multiemployer unit ignores the fundamental rule that an employer may not displace union members with nonunion members solely on account of union membership, the prototype of discrimination under 8 (a) (3), Labor Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, and may not maintain operations and refuse to retain or hire nonstriking union members, notwithstanding that most of the union members and most of the workers at that very plant are on strike. The struck employer need not continue operations, but if he does, he may not give a preference to employees not affiliated with the striking union, any more than he may do so after the strike, for 7 explicitly and unequivocally protects the right of employees to engage and not to engage in a concerted activity and 8 (a) (3) clearly prohibits discrimination which discourages union membership. See Firth Carpet Co. v. Labor Board, 129 F.2d 633 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Labor Board v. Shenandoah-Dives Mining Co., 145 F.2d 542 (C. A. 10th Cir.); Labor Board v. Clausen, 188 F.2d 439 (C. A. 3d Cir.), cert. denied, \n342 \nU.S. 868\n; Labor Board v. Anchor Rome Mills, 228 F.2d 775, 780 (C. A. 5th Cir.); Labor Board v. Robinson, 251 F.2d 639 (C. A. 6th Cir.). If dismissing and replacing nonstriking union members at a struck plant discourages union membership and interferes with concerted activities, I fail to understand how this same conduct at a nonstruck plant, even if in the name of multiemployer parity and unity, has a different effect on employee rights. The employees are not on strike, and desire to work, for whatever reasons, and nothing in the right to lock out can alter these facts. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 298]\n\u00a0\n The Court finds it unnecessary to explain how they are removed from the explicit protections of the Act, except to say they belong to the union or the unit the union represents and to assume conclusively they share its whipsawing purpose. Membership has never quite meant this before. The Court's justification for this invasion of employee rights by a member of a multiemployer unit is the employer's right to burden the union strike fund with all its members to bring economic pressure to bear on the union. Unfortunately, this reasoning has equal, if not greater, force in the single employer partial strike situation.\n\nFinally, I cannot agree with the Court's fundamental premise on which its balance of rights is founded: that a lockout followed by the hiring of nonunion men to operate the plant has but a \"slight\" tendency to discourage union membership, which includes participation in union activities, Radio Officers' Union v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17\n, and to impinge on concerted activity generally. This proposition overturns the Board's long-held views on the effect of lockouts and dismissal of union members. Moreover, it is difficult to fathom the logic or industrial experience which on the one hand dictates that a guarantee to strike replacements that they will not be laid off after a strike is \"inherently destructive of employee interests,\" although based on a legitimate and important business justification, Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S. 221\n, and yet at the same time dictates that the dismissal of and refusal to hire nonstriking union members, who desire to work, because other union members working for a different employer have struck, have but a slight unimportant inhibiting effect on the affiliation with the union and on concerted activities. I think the Board's finding that this activity substantially burdens concerted activities and discourages union membership is far more consistent with Erie Resistor and industrial realities. Hence the Board \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 299]\n\u00a0\n was well within its authority in opting for explicitly protected statutory rights of employees as against a limited employer privilege allowable only in exceptional circumstances under an unbroken line of Board decisions since the inception of the Act.\n\n \"Although the Act protects the right of the employees to strike in support of their demands, this protection is not so absolute as to deny self-help by employers when legitimate interests of employees and employers collide. Conflict may arise, for example, between the right to strike and the interest of small employers in preserving multi-employer bargaining . . . . The ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\" Buffalo Linen, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 96\n.\n\n\n This is especially so where integrity of a multiemployer bargaining unit is the principal factor to be considered, since \"the compelling conclusion is that Congress . . . `intended to leave to the Board's specialized judgment the inevitable questions concerning multi-employer bargaining bound to arise in the future.'\" Ibid. I think the Court now repudiates this decision and assumes for itself the \"delicate task . . . of weighing the interests of employees in concerted activity against the interest of the employer in operating his business in a particular manner.\" Erie Resistor, \n373 \nU.S. 221, 229\n. I would adhere to our prior cases and affirm the decision of the Board. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 278, 300]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLABOR BOARD v. METROPOLITAN INS. CO.(1965)\nNo. 98\nArgued: January 21, 1965Decided: April 5, 1965\n\n\n\n\n A union over the protest of respondent company was certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act as the bargaining representative of all debit insurance agents at respondent's district office in Woonsocket, R. I. Following respondent's refusal to bargain with the certified unit, the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB, which, adhering to its determination, directed respondent to bargain with the union. The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the NLRB order, having concluded that, contrary to 9 (c) (5), the NLRB had regarded as controlling the extent to which the employees had organized. This conclusion was based on the NLRB's failure to articulate reasons for the unit determination in this case; its apparently inconsistent determinations of appropriate units of respondent's employees in other areas; its failure to evaluate the factor there of the extent of union organization; and its consistent certification of the unit requested by the union. Held:\n\n 1. Under 9 (c) (5) the extent of union organization may be considered as one factor, but not as the controlling factor, in determining the appropriate bargaining unit. Pp. 441-442.\n\n\n 2. The considerations relied upon by the Court of Appeals did not compel the conclusion that the NLRB had violated 9 (c) (5). P. 442.\n\n\n 3. The NLRB has, however, failed to articulate reasons for decision in and distinctions among this and other cases in this area. Pp. 442-443.\n\n\n 4. The integrity of the administrative process requires that courts may not accept appellate counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency action. Pp. 443-444.\n\n\n 5. Because of the failure of the NLRB to state the basis of its decision in this and other cases in this area, its action cannot be properly reviewed and thus the judgment of the Court of Appeals \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 439]\n\u00a0\n must be vacated and the case remanded to that court with instructions to remand it to the NLRB. P. 444.\n\n\n 327 F.2d 906, vacated and remanded.\n\nDaniel M. Friedman argued the cause for petitioner. On the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Arnold Ordman, Dominick L. Manoli, Norton J. Come and Warren M. Davison.\n\nBurton A. Zorn argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were George G. Gallantz, Thomas F. Delaney and Marvin Dicker.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn petition of Insurance Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, and over the protest of respondent, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, as to the appropriateness of the bargaining unit, the National Labor Relations Board, in a proceeding under 9 (c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 453, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 159 (c) (1958 ed.), certified the union as the bargaining representative of all debit insurance agents, including all canvassing regular and office account agents, at respondent's district office in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.\n1\n Respondent deliberately refused to bargain with the union in order to challenge the appropriateness of the employee unit certified by the Board. See Pittsburgh Glass Co. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 146\n. The union thereupon filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board. The Board, adhering to its prior unit determination, held that respondent violated 8 (a) (1) and (5) of the Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1) and (5) (1958 ed.), and directed respondent to bargain with the union. 142 N. L. R. B. 491. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit refused to enforce the order on \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n the grounds that in light of the \"Board's failure to articulate specific reasons for its unit determination,\" 327 F.2d 906, 909, the Board's apparently inconsistent determinations of appropriate units of respondent's employees in other cities or regions, see 138 N. L. R. B. 565 (Delaware); 138 N. L. R. B. 734 (Sioux City); 144 N. L. R. B. 149 (Chicago); 138 N. L. R. B. 512 (Cleveland),\n2\n its failure to discuss in these cases what weight, if any, it gave to the factor of the extent of union organization, and the fact that in these cases the Board consistently certified the unit requested by the union, the Court of Appeals could \"only conclude that the . . . Board . . . has indeed . . . [regarded] the extent of union organization as controlling in violation of 9 (c) (5) of the Act.\" 327 F.2d, at 911. We granted certiorari because \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n of an apparent conflict between this decision and the decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board, 328 F.2d 820, petition for certiorari pending, No. 56 this Term, which sustained the Board's determination in the Delaware case, 138 N. L. R. B. 565, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board, 330 F.2d 62, petition for certiorari pending, No. 229 this Term, which sustained the Board's determination in the Cleveland case, 138 N. L. R. B. 512. See also Labor Board v. Western & Southern Life Ins. Co., 328 F.2d 891 (C. A. 3d Cir.), petition for certiorari pending, No. 91 this Term.\n\nSection 9 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 453, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 159 (b) (1958 ed.) provides:\n\n  \"The Board shall decide in each case whether, in order to assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this subchapter, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof . . . .\"\n\n\n This broad delegation of authority, see Pittsburgh Glass Co. v. Labor Board, supra, was limited in 1947 by the enactment of 9 (c) (5) of the Act, 61 Stat. 144, 29 U.S.C. 159 (c) (5) (1958 ed.), which provides that \"[i]n determining whether a unit is appropriate for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section the extent to which the employees have organized shall not be controlling.\"\n\nAlthough it is clear that in passing this amendment Congress intended to overrule Board decisions where the unit determined could only be supported on the basis of the extent of organization, both the language and legislative \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n history\n3\n of 9 (c) (5) demonstrate that the provision was not intended to prohibit the Board from considering the extent of organization as one factor, though not the controlling factor, in its unit determination.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals here properly recognized this effect of 9 (c) (5), but held, in light of the unarticulated bases of decision, and what appeared to it to be inconsistent determinations approving units requested by the union, that the only conclusion that it could reach was that the Board has made the extent of organization the controlling factor, in violation of the congressional mandate. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the enforcing court should not overlook or ignore an evasion of the 9 (c) (5) command. We further agree that in determining whether or not there has been such an evasion, the results in other recent decisions of the Board are relevant. We cannot, however, agree that the only possible conclusion here is that the Board has violated 9 (c) (5). Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board (Cleveland), supra; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Labor Board (Delaware), supra.\n\nOn the other hand, due to the Board's lack of articulated reasons for the decisions in and distinctions among these cases,\n5\n the Board's action here cannot be properly \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n reviewed. When the Board so exercises the discretion given to it by Congress, it must \"disclose the basis of its order\" and \"give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.\"\n6\n Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n. See Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 156, 167\n-169; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. J-T Transport Co., \n368 \nU.S. 81, 93\n. Although Board counsel in his brief and argument before this Court has rationalized the different unit determinations in the variant factual \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n situations of these cases on criteria other than a controlling effect being given to the extent of organization, the integrity of the administrative process requires that \"courts may not accept appellate counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency action . . . .\" Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, supra, at 168; see Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 196\n. For reviewing courts to substitute counsel's rationale or their discretion for that of the Board is incompatible with the orderly function of the process of judicial review. Such action would not vindicate, but would deprecate the administrative process for it would \"propel the court into the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.\" Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., supra, at 196.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded to that court with instructions to remand it to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Decision and Direction of Election issued by the Board on October 24, 1962, is unreported.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the Delaware case the Board certified as a unit two of respondent's three district offices in the State; in the Sioux City case the unit certified was respondent's single district office in Sioux City, Iowa, together with two detached offices under its administrative control in Fargo, North Dakota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, 284 and 120 miles distant, respectively, from Sioux City; in the Chicago case the unit certified was that of all of the district offices within the city limits of Chicago, although some of the city offices had territories extending into the suburbs and some of the suburban offices' territories extended into the city; in the Cleveland case the certified unit consisted of respondent's six offices in the city as well as three offices in the suburbs; finally, in the instant case the unit certified was respondent's single district office in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, out of the eight offices in the State and the 75 offices in respondent's \"New England Territory.\" In addition to the instant case and the Sioux City case, the Board has certified single district offices in Western & Southern Life Ins.

The nearest district office is located 12 miles away in Pawtucket. In the prior proceeding in Case No. 4-RC-4865, based on the same record incorporated by reference herein, we found that each of Employer's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n individual district offices was in effect a separate administrative entity through which the Employer conducted its business operations, and therefore was inherently appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining. See Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 138 NLRB . . . . 565.. Applying the tests set forth therein, we find that, since there is no recent history of collective bargaining, no union seeking a larger unit, and the district office sought is located in a separate and distinct geographical area, the employees located at the Woonsocket district office constitute an appropriate unit. See also Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, . . . 138. NLRB . . . 734..\" The cases cited are the Board's decisions in the Delaware and Sioux City cases discussed supra. They do not appear, because of their variant factual circumstances, to be direct authority for decision in this case. Moreover, the Board made no attempt to distinguish other cases, particularly the Chicago and Cleveland cases discussed supra, in which it certified different types of units. The unfair labor practice proceeding added nothing to the analysis, as the trial examiner did not review the issue, as he felt \"bound by the Board's ruling in the representation proceeding,\" 142 N. L. R. B., at 492, and the Board affirmed the trial examiner's ruling without discussion, id., at 491.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Of course, the Board may articulate the basis of its order by reference to other decisions or its general policies laid down in its rules and its annual reports, reflecting its \"cumulative experience,\" Labor Board v.

How stale this record may be we do not know. Neither of the parties asks for a remand.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese appeals present the same question: is 305 (a) of the Postal Service and Federal Employees Salary Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 840, constitutional as construed and applied? The statute provides in part:\n\n \"Mail matter, except sealed letters, which originates or which is printed or otherwise prepared in a foreign country and which is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to rules and regulations to be promulgated by him to be `communist political propaganda,' shall be detained by the Postmaster General upon its arrival for delivery in the United States, or upon its subsequent deposit in the United States domestic mails, and the addressee shall be notified that such matter has been received and will be delivered only upon the addressee's request, except that such detention shall not be required in the case of any matter which is furnished pursuant to subscription or which is otherwise ascertained by the Postmaster General to be desired by the addressee.\" 39 U.S.C. 4008 (a).\n\n\n The statute defines \"communist political propaganda\" as political propaganda (as that term is defined in 1 (j) of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938\n1\n) which is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 303]\n\u00a0\n issued by or on behalf of any country with respect to which there is in effect a suspension or withdrawal of tariff concessions or from which foreign assistance is withheld pursuant to certain specified statutes. 39 U.S.C. 4008 (b). The statute contains an exemption from its provisions for mail addressed to government agencies and educational institutions, or officials thereof, and for mail sent pursuant to a reciprocal cultural international agreement. 39 U.S.C. 4008 (c).\n\nTo implement the statute the Post Office maintains 10 or 11 screening points through which is routed all unsealed mail from the designated foreign countries. At these points the nonexempt mail is examined by Customs authorities. When it is determined that a piece of mail is \"communist political propaganda,\" the addressee is mailed a notice identifying the mail being detained and advising that it will be destroyed unless the addressee requests delivery by returning an attached reply card within 20 days.\n\nPrior to March 1, 1965, the reply card contained a space in which the addressee could request delivery of any \"similar publication\" in the future. A list of the persons thus manifesting a desire to receive \"communist political propaganda\" was maintained by the Post Office. The Government in its brief informs us that the keeping of this list was terminated, effective March 15, 1965. Thus, under the new practice, a notice is sent and must be returned for each individual piece of mail desired. The only standing instruction which it is now possible to leave with the Post Office is not to deliver any \"communist political \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 304]\n\u00a0\n propaganda.\"\n2\n And the Solicitor General advises us that the Post Office Department \"intends to retain its assumption that those who do not return the card want neither the identified publication nor any similar one arriving subsequently.\"\n\nNo. 491 arose out of the Post Office's detention in 1963 of a copy of the Peking Review # 12 addressed to appellant, Dr. Corliss Lamont, who is engaged in the publishing and distributing of pamphlets. Lamont did not respond to the notice of detention which was sent to him but instead instituted this suit to enjoin enforcement of the statute, alleging that it infringed his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. The Post Office thereupon notified Lamont that it considered his institution of the suit to be an expression of his desire to receive \"communist political propaganda\" and therefore none of his mail would be detained. Lamont amended his complaint to challenge on constitutional grounds the placement of his name on the list of those desiring to receive \"communist political propaganda.\" The majority of the three-judge District Court nonetheless dismissed the complaint as moot, 229 F. Supp. 913, because Lamont would now receive his mail unimpeded. Insofar as the list was concerned, the majority thought that any legally significant harm to Lamont as a result of being listed was merely a speculative possibility, and so on this score the controversy was not yet ripe for adjudication. Lamont appealed from the dismissal, and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n379 \nU.S. 926\n.\n\nLike Lamont, appellee Heilberg in No. 848, when his mail was detained, refused to return the reply card and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 305]\n\u00a0\n instead filed a complaint in the District Court for an injunction against enforcement of the statute. The Post Office reacted to this complaint in the same manner as it had to Lamont's complaint, but the District Court declined to hold that Heilberg's action was thereby mooted. Instead the District Court reached the merits and unanimously held that the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. 236 F. Supp. 405. The Government appealed and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n379 \nU.S. 997\n.\n\nThere is no longer even a colorable question of mootness in these cases, for the new procedure, as described above, requires the postal authorities to send a separate notice for each item as it is received and the addressee to make a separate request for each item. Under the new system, we are told, there can be no list of persons who have manifested a desire to receive \"communist political propaganda\" and whose mail will therefore go through relatively unimpeded. The Government concedes that the changed procedure entirely precludes any claim of mootness and leaves for our consideration the sole question of the constitutionality of the statute.\n\nWe conclude that the Act as construed and applied is unconstitutional because it requires an official act (viz., returning the reply card) as a limitation on the unfettered exercise of the addressee's First Amendment rights. As stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in Milwaukee Pub. Co. v. Burleson, \n255 \nU.S. 407, 437\n (dissenting): \"The United States may give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues . . . .\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe struck down in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, a flat license tax on the exercise of First Amendment rights. A registration requirement imposed on a labor union organizer before making a speech met the same fate in Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516\n. A municipal licensing system for those distributing literature was held invalid in Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n. We recently reviewed in Harman v. Forssenius, \n380 \nU.S. 528\n, an attempt by a State to impose a burden on the exercise of a right under the Twenty-fourth Amendment. There, a registration was required by all federal electors who did not pay the state poll tax. We stated:\n\n\"For federal elections, the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed. Any material requirement imposed upon the federal voter solely because of his refusal to waive the constitutional immunity subverts the effectiveness of the Twenty-fourth Amendment and must fall under its ban.\" Id., p. 542.\n\n\n Here the Congress - expressly restrained by the First Amendment from \"abridging\" freedom of speech and of press - is the actor. The Act sets administrative officials astride the flow of mail to inspect it, appraise it, write the addressee about it, and await a response before dispatching the mail. Just as the licensing or taxing authorities in the Lovell, Thomas, and Murdock cases sought to control the flow of ideas to the public, so here federal agencies regulate the flow of mail. We do not have here, any more than we had in Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., \n327 \nU.S. 146\n, any question concerning the extent to which Congress may \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 307]\n\u00a0\n classify the mail and fix the charges for its carriage. Nor do we reach the question whether the standard here applied could pass constitutional muster. Nor do we deal with the right of Customs to inspect material from abroad for contraband. We rest on the narrow ground that the addressee in order to receive his mail must request in writing that it be delivered. This amounts in our judgment to an unconstitutional abridgment of the addressee's First Amendment rights. The addressee carries an affirmative obligation which we do not think the Government may impose on him. This requirement is almost certain to have a deterrent effect, especially as respects those who have sensitive positions. Their livelihood may be dependent on a security clearance. Public officials, like schoolteachers who have no tenure, might think they would invite disaster if they read what the Federal Government says contains the seeds of treason. Apart from them, any addressee is likely to feel some inhibition in sending for literature which federal officials have condemned as \"communist political propaganda.\" The regime of this Act is at war with the \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\" debate and discussion that are contemplated by the First Amendment. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, \n376 \nU.S. 254, 270\n.\n\nWe reverse the judgment in No. 491 and affirm that in No. 848.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The term `political propaganda' includes any oral, visual, graphic, written, pictorial, or other communication or expression by any person (1) which is reasonably adapted to, or which the person disseminating the same believes will, or which he intends to, prevail upon, indoctrinate, convert, induce, or in any other way influence a recipient or any section of the public within the United States with reference to the political or public interests, policies, or relations of a government of a foreign country or a foreign political party or with reference to the foreign policies of the United States or promote in the United States racial, religious, or social dissensions, or (2) which advocates, advises, instigates, or promotes any racial, social, political, or religious \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 303]\n\u00a0\n disorder, civil riot, or other conflict involving the use of force or violence in any other American republic or the overthrow of any government or political subdivision of any other American republic by any means involving the use of force or violence.\" 22 U.S.C. 611 (j).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A Post Office regulation permits a patron to refuse delivery of any piece of mail (39 CFR 44.1 (a)) or to request in writing a withholding from delivery for a period not to exceed two years of specifically described items of certain mail, including \"foreign printed matter.\" Ibid.

Rev. 805, 847.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"Whatever may have been the voluntary nature of the postal system in the period of its establishment, it is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal affairs of the people are conducted and upon which depends in a greater degree than upon \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 306]\n\u00a0\n any other activity of government the promotion of the general welfare.\" Pike v. Walker, 73 App. D.C. 289, 291, 121 F.2d 37, 39. And see Gellhorn, Individual Freedom and Governmental Restraints, p. 88 et seq. (1956).\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG joins, concurring.\n\nThese might be troublesome cases if the addressees predicated their claim for relief upon the First Amendment rights of the senders. To succeed, the addressees \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 308]\n\u00a0\n would then have to establish their standing to vindicate the senders' constitutional rights, cf. Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S. 479, 486\n, as well as First Amendment protection for political propaganda prepared and printed abroad by or on behalf of a foreign government, cf. Johnson v. Eisentrager, \n339 \nU.S. 763, 781\n-785. However, those questions are not before us, since the addressees assert First Amendment claims in their own right: they contend that the Government is powerless to interfere with the delivery of the material because the First Amendment \"necessarily protects the right to receive it.\" Martin v. City of Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141, 143\n. Since the decisions today uphold this contention, I join the Court's opinion.\n\nIt is true that the First Amendment contains no specific guarantee of access to publications. However, the protection of the Bill of Rights goes beyond the specific guarantees to protect from congressional abridgment those equally fundamental personal rights necessary to make the express guarantees fully meaningful. See, e. g., Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 \nU.S. 497\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n. I think the right to receive publications is such a fundamental right. The dissemination of ideas can accomplish nothing if otherwise willing addressees are not free to receive and consider them. It would be a barren marketplace of ideas that had only sellers and no buyers.\n\nEven if we were to accept the characterization of this statute as a regulation not intended to control the content of speech, but only incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, see Zemel v. Rusk, \n381 \nU.S. 1, 16\n-17, we \"have consistently held that only a compelling [governmental] interest in the regulation of a subject within [governmental] constitutional power to regulate can justify \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 309]\n\u00a0\n limiting First Amendment freedoms.\" NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415, 438\n. The Government's brief expressly disavows any support for this statute \"in large public interests such as would be needed to justify a true restriction upon freedom of expression or inquiry.\" Rather the Government argues that, since an addressee taking the trouble to return the card can receive the publication named in it, only inconvenience and not an abridgment is involved. But inhibition as well as prohibition against the exercise of precious First Amendment rights is a power denied to government. See, e. g., Freedman v. Maryland, \n380 \nU.S. 51\n; Garrison v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 64\n; Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513\n. The registration requirement which was struck down in Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516\n, was not appreciably more burdensome. Moreover, the addressee's failure to return this form results in nondelivery not only of the particular publication but also of all similar publications or material. Thus, although the addressee may be content not to receive the particular publication, and hence does not return the card, the consequence is a denial of access to like publications which he may desire to receive. In any event, we cannot sustain an intrusion on First Amendment rights on the ground that the intrusion is only a minor one. As the Court said in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n:\n\n\"It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 310]\n\u00a0\n It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\"\n\n\n The Government asserts that Congress enacted the statute in the awareness that Communist political propaganda mailed to addressees in the United States on behalf of foreign governments was often offensive to the recipients and constituted a subsidy to the very governments which bar the dissemination of publications from the United States. But the sensibilities of the unwilling recipient are fully safeguarded by 39 CFR 44.1 (a) (Supp. 1965) under which the Post Office will honor his request to stop delivery; the statute under consideration, on the other hand, impedes delivery even to a willing addressee. In the area of First Amendment freedoms, government has the duty to confine itself to the least intrusive regulations which are adequate for the purpose. Cf. Butler v. Michigan, \n352 \nU.S. 380\n. The argument that the statute is justified by the object of avoiding the subsidization of propaganda of foreign governments which bar American propaganda needs little comment. If the Government wishes to withdraw a subsidy or a privilege, it must do so by means and on terms which do not endanger First Amendment rights. Cf. Speiser v. Randall, supra. That the governments which originate this propaganda themselves have no equivalent guarantees only highlights the cherished values of our constitutional framework; it can never justify emulating the practice of restrictive regimes in the name of expediency.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the judgment of the Court on the grounds set forth in this concurring opinion. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 301, 311]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEH v. GENERAL PETROLEUM CORP.(1965)\nNo. 11584\nArgued: October 11, 1965Decided: November 8, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners' private antitrust suit against seven gasoline producers was dismissed as untimely and not entitled to the benefit of 5 (b) of the Clayton Act, which provides for tolling the statute of limitations during the pendency of an antitrust suit brought by the United States where the private action is \"based in whole or in part on any matter complained of\" in the government suit. The Court of Appeals, upholding the District Court, held that the statute of limitations was not suspended because there were different overt acts charged, and different conspiracies, occurring at different times between different parties. Held:\n\n 1. Petitioners' action here was based in part on matters complained of in the government suit and the 5 (b) tolling provision was therefore applicable. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., \n381 \nU.S. 311\n, followed.

P. 64.\n\n\n 2. In general, the applicability of 5 (b) is determined by a comparison of the two complaints on their face, and is not based on proof of the allegations made therein. Pp. 65-66.\n\n\n 330 F.2d 288, reversed.\n\nRichard G. Harris argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was Maxwell Keith.\n\nFrancis R. Kirkham argued the cause for respondents.

Jansen.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn September 28, 1956, petitioners, a partnership engaged in wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products and one of the partners, filed in the Southern District of California a treble-damage action charging violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2 (1964 ed.), against seven companies engaged in producing, refining, and marketing gasoline and other hydrocarbon substances in interstate commerce. Defendants contended that the action was barred by the California one-year statute of limitations applicable to suits for statutory penalties or forfeitures, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 340 (1). Plaintiffs conceded that their cause of action accrued no later than February 1954, and that the four-year limitation provision added to the Clayton Act in 1955, Clayton Act 4B, 69 Stat. 283, 15 U.S.C. 15b (1964 ed.), was not applicable to a right of action accruing in 1954. But plaintiffs contended that the governing provision was the California three-years statute of limitations respecting actions on a statutory liability other than a penalty, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 338 (1), and that in any event the running of the statute of limitations was tolled by 5 (b) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b) (1964 ed.), because of a civil antitrust proceeding that was commenced by the United States in 1950 and was still pending when plaintiffs filed their complaint. Section 5 (b) provides that during the pendency of a civil or criminal proceeding instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws, the running of the statute of limitations shall be suspended in respect of every private right of action \"based in whole or in part on any matter \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n complained of in said proceeding.\"\n1\n The lower courts upheld the defense of limitations and dismissed the complaint, holding that the one-year statute governed and that plaintiffs were not entitled to the benefit of 5 (b). 208 F. Supp. 289 (D.C. S. D. Cal. 1962), aff'd, 330 F.2d 288 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1964). We granted certiorari limited to the question of the applicability of 5 (b), \n379 \nU.S. 877\n, because of an apparent conflict between this case and Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley, 300 F.2d 561 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1962), dismissed under Rule 60 sub nom. Wade v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., \n371 \nU.S. 801\n, concerning interpretation of the statutory requirement that the private action for which the benefit of the tolling provision is sought be \"based in whole or in part on any matter complained of\" in the government proceeding. We conclude that the lower courts misapplied 5 (b), and we reverse the judgment below.\n\nPrior to the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had declared a restrictive interpretation of 5 (b). In Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., 232 F.2d 190 (1956), that court ruled that the scope of 5 (b) was determined by the principles of collateral estoppel applicable under 5 (a) of the Clayton Act, as amended, 69 Stat. 283, 15 U.S.C. 16 (a) (1964 ed.), which provides that a final judgment or decree \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 57]\n\u00a0\n rendered in a suit by the United States and holding a defendant in violation of the antitrust laws shall be prima facie evidence in a private antitrust action against such defendant \"as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto.\"\n2\n Accordingly, the court declared in Steiner that \"[a] greater similarity is needed than that the same conspiracies are alleged. The same means must be used to achieve the same objectives of the same conspiracies by the same defendants.\" 232 F.2d ___, at 196. In the present case the Court of Appeals purported to follow Steiner and concluded that the running of the statute of limitations was not suspended because here, in the court's opinion, \"there were not only different overt acts charged, but different conspiracies, occurring at different times, between different parties.\" 330 F.2d, at 301; see also 208 F. Supp., at 294-295. Conflicting with Steiner and the present case is Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley, supra, which held that the evidentiary rules of estoppel are not determinative and that the running of the period of limitations is tolled by 5 (b) if there is \"substantial identity of subject matter.\" 300 F.2d, at 570. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMinnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., \n381 \nU.S. 311\n, which was decided in the interim between the granting of certiorari and oral argument in the present case, establishes certain basic principles for the construction of 5 (b) that are to be followed here. The questions presented for decision in Minnesota Mining were whether proceedings by the Federal Trade Commission under 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18 (1964 ed.), activate 5 (b) to the same extent as judicial proceedings and, if so, whether the claim of New Jersey Wood, the private plaintiff, was based on \"any matter complained of\" in the Commission action. One of the arguments advanced with respect to the first question was that Commission proceedings did not suspend the running of limitations because, it was asserted, any Commission order that might issue would not be admissible under 5 (a). We rejected this contention that 5 (a) and 5 (b) were coextensive.\n\n \"It may be . . . that when it was enacted the tolling provision was a logical backstop for the prima facie evidence clause of 5 (a). But even though  5 (b) complements 5 (a) in this respect by permitting a litigant to await the outcome of government proceedings and use any judgment or decree rendered therein . . . it is certainly not restricted to that effect. As we have pointed out, the textual distinctions as well as the policy basis of 5 (b) indicate that it was to serve a more comprehensive function in the congressional scheme of things. The Government's initial action may aid the private litigant in a number of other ways. The pleadings, transcripts of testimony, exhibits and documents are available to him in most instances. . . . Moreover, difficult questions of law may be tested and definitively \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 59]\n\u00a0\n resolved before the private litigant enters the fray. The greater resources and expertise of the Commission and its staff render the private suitor a tremendous benefit aside from any value he may derive from a judgment or decree. Indeed, so useful is this service that government proceedings are recognized as a major source of evidence for private parties.\" \n381 \nU.S., at 319\n.\n\n\n Minnesota Mining sweeps away much of the foundation for the Steiner view of the scope of 5 (b). The private plaintiff is not required to allege that the same means were used to achieve the same objectives of the same conspiracies by the same defendants. Rather, effect must be given to the broad terms of the statute itself - \"based in whole or in part on any matter complained of\" (emphasis added) - read in light of Congress' \"belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.\" \n381 \nU.S., at 318\n. Doubtlessly, care must be exercised to insure that reliance upon the government proceeding is not mere sham and that the matters complained of in the government suit bear a real relation to the private plaintiff's claim for relief. But the courts must not allow a legitimate concern that invocation of 5 (b) be made in good faith to lead them into a niggardly construction of the statutory language here in question. With those matters in mind we now turn to a comparison of plaintiff's complaint with the complaint in the government proceedings on which plaintiffs rely, United States v. Standard Oil Co. of California, Civil No. 11584-C, D.C. S. D. Cal.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 60]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe complaint of the United States charged that seven petroleum companies and the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers had conspired together to restrain and to monopolize interstate commerce in the Pacific States area in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, beginning in or about the year 1936, and continuing up to and including the date suit was filed in 1950. The complaint divided the conspiracy into two principal branches: (1) agreement by the defendants to eliminate competition among themselves in the Pacific States area and (2) agreement by the defendants to utilize their control of the production, transportation, refining, and marketing of crude oil and refined petroleum products to restrict and to eliminate the competition of independent producers, refiners and marketers in the Pacific States area. In furtherance of the first branch of the conspiracy, the complaint further charged, defendants had conspired to do and had actually accomplished the following things, among others: sharing wholesale and retail markets with each other by selling gasoline and other refined petroleum products at identical prices, thus confining effective competition among themselves to the advertising of brand names and to the offering of free services in their retail outlets; fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices for the sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products at wholesale and at retail; refusing to sell their petroleum products to any wholesale or retail distributor who failed or refused to follow the prices fixed by them; and refusing to sell their petroleum products to any wholesale distributor, jobber, or retail dealer except on a \"full-requirements\" or \"exclusive-dealer\" basis. Among acts and agreements charged as having been accomplished in furtherance of the second branch of the conspiracy were the following: coercing independent producers into limiting production of crude oil through production quotas established \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 61]\n\u00a0\n by the defendant Conservation Committee; limiting the supply of crude oil available to independent refiners and refusing to sell crude oil to such refiners; acquiring control of independent refiners; inducing independent refiners to shut down their productive capacity or to dismantle their refining facilities in return for an agreement to furnish such independent refiners with their full requirements of gasoline and other refined petroleum products; foreclosing independent wholesale and retail markets otherwise available to the independent refiners by requiring independent jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers to handle exclusively the refined petroleum products of defendants.\n\nPlaintiffs' amended complaint in the present case also charged a conspiracy to violate 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The period of the conspiracy of which plaintiffs complained varied somewhat from that charged in the government action, plaintiffs alleging that the conspiracy herein commenced in or about the year 1948 (the year in which plaintiffs commenced business) and continued until the date of the filing of the complaint in 1956. The defendants were the same as those in the government proceeding, except that Shell Oil Company and the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers were named as defendants in the government suit and were not defendants here, and Olympic Oil Company was named as a defendant here and was not a defendant in the government proceeding.\n4\n The complaint charged that defendants had agreed to restrain and to monopolize the wholesale and retail distribution of refined gasoline throughout the southern California area by excluding independent jobbers from such distribution and by eliminating the jobbers' customers, i. e., retail outlets, and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 62]\n\u00a0\n preventing those customers from competing with retail outlets owned and operated by defendants. In particular, defendants were alleged to have accomplished their unlawful purposes by the following acts: controlling the sale and distribution of refined gasoline in the southern California area; denying independent jobbers access to a source of supply of refined gasoline; preventing independent jobbers from obtaining refined gasoline from other sources; preventing the customers of independent jobbers from obtaining gasoline with which to compete with retail service stations and outlets operated or controlled by defendants; maintaining fixed, artificial, and noncompetitive prices for the wholesale and retail sale of refined gasoline in the southern California area and fixing the price at which gasoline would be sold, if at all, to independent dealers and jobbers; and generally controlling the sources of refined gasoline in the southern California area and preventing and precluding independent jobbers from obtaining a source of supply. Plaintiffs claimed injury to their independent jobber business through a loss of profits resulting from price-fixing and from the destruction of their business because of the termination of their source of supply.\n\nThe lower courts found that plaintiffs' complaint was not based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in the government proceeding principally because of the differences in the defendants named in the two suits and in the period of the conspiracies alleged. See 330 F.2d, at 301; 208 F. Supp., at 294-295. We cannot agree that these differences bar resort to the tolling provision in this case.\n\nHere too we may find guidance in Minnesota Mining. In that case, the plaintiff, a manufacturer of electrical insulation materials, brought suit against Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company and the Essex Wire Corporation, the complaint alleging violations of 7 of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 63]\n\u00a0\n the Clayton Act and 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The substance of the complaint concerned the acquisition by Minnesota Mining from Essex of Insulation and Wires, Inc., which thereafter ceased to distribute plaintiff's products, and an alleged conspiracy between Minnesota Mining and Essex to restrain trade in electrical insulation products. The action upon which plaintiff relied as suspending the running of limitations was a Federal Trade Commission proceeding under 7 against Minnesota Mining but not against Essex. Essex was not a party to the interlocutory appeal in the private action and no contention was made here that the difference in parties prevented tolling of limitations as to Minnesota Mining. Minnesota Mining did argue that because of the greater burden of proof under the Sherman Act, plaintiff's Sherman Act claims could not be held to be based in part on any matter complained of in the Clayton Act proceeding before the Commission. This Court found that \"both suits set up substantially the same claims,\" \n381 \nU.S., at 323\n, and rejected Minnesota Mining's argument.\n\nJust as in Minnesota Mining the differences between Sherman Act and Clayton Act proceedings were held not to require the conclusion that the private action under the Sherman Act was not based in part on any matter complained of in the Government's 7 suit, so here we cannot conclude that a private claimant may invoke 5 (b) only if the conspiracy of which he complains has the same breadth and scope in time and participants as the conspiracy described in the government action on which he relies. Here there is substantial identity of parties, six of the seven defendants in this case being defendants in the government suit as well. In suits of this kind, the absence of complete identity of defendants may be explained on several grounds unrelated to the question of whether the private claimant's suit is based on matters \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 64]\n\u00a0\n of which the Government complained. In the interim between the filing of the two actions it may have become apparent that a party named as a defendant by the Government was in fact not a party to the antitrust violation alleged. Or the private plaintiff may prefer to limit his suit to the defendants named by the Government whose activities contributed most directly to the injury of which he complains. On the other hand, some of the conspirators whose activities injured the private claimant may have been too low in the conspiracy to be selected as named defendants or co-conspirators in the Government's necessarily broader net. The overlap in the time periods of the two conspiracies is less complete, but this disparity is equally without significance. That plaintiffs alleged a conspiracy corresponding in time to the period during which they were in business obviously does not mean that this conspiracy is not based in part on matters complained of by the Government. Nor can that conclusion be drawn from the fact that plaintiffs focus on the southern California area, which is only a part of the Pacific States area with which the Government was concerned.\n\nIt is obvious from a comparison of the two complaints that plaintiffs' suit is based in part on matters of which the Government complained. The Government charged that defendants had conspired to eliminate the competition of independent marketers; plaintiffs charged a conspiracy to eliminate independent jobbers and retailers. Both the plaintiffs and the Government alleged that defendants had fixed prices at wholesale and at retail. The Government alleged that defendants had conspired to eliminate the competition of independent refiners by acquiring such refiners, limiting the supply of crude oil available to them, and inducing them to shut down their refining facilities; plaintiffs complained that defendants had denied them a source of supply and prevented them \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 65]\n\u00a0\n from obtaining gasoline from other sources. To require more detailed duplication of claims would be to resurrect the collateral estoppel approach declared in Steiner and rejected by this Court in Minnesota Mining.\n\nDefendants contend, however, that during the extensive discovery proceedings that preceded the ruling on the motion to dismiss, plaintiffs made certain concessions establishing that, whatever the complaint may allege, plaintiffs' claim in fact is not based at all on any matter complained of by the Government in Standard Oil. Plaintiffs' real claim, defendants say, is that they had an arrangement with Olympic Refining Company under which they were to be supplied with gasoline as long as Olympic was in turn supplied by defendant General Petroleum Corporation, that defendant Standard Oil Company of California replaced General Petroleum Corporation as Olympic's supplier in February 1954, and that plaintiffs' supply was thereby terminated. The attorney for plaintiffs stated in a hearing before the trial court that General Petroleum Corporation had the absolute right to terminate its supply to Olympic at any time and that if General had in this case done so unilaterally plaintiffs would not be in court. But plaintiffs contended that defendants conspired together to effect the termination of General's supplier relationship with Olympic. Defendants argue that this conspiracy to terminate a particular supply contract is far removed from the matters with which the government complaint was concerned.\n\nIn general, consideration of the applicability of 5 (b) must be limited to a comparison of the two complaints on their face. Obviously suspension of the running of the statute of limitations pending resolution of the government action may not be made to turn on whether the United States is successful in proving the allegations of its complaint. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. New \n\n[382 \nU.S. 54, 66]\n\u00a0\n Jersey Wood Finishing Co., \n381 \nU.S. 311, 316\n. Equally, the availability of 5 (b) to the private claimant may not be made dependent on his ability to prove his case, however fatal failure may prove to his hopes of success on the merits.\n\nMoreover, defendants' argument contains a basic flaw in that it does not take account of all that plaintiffs' counsel said. The relationship between plaintiffs and General was one of subdistributorship, and there were accordingly two levels in the chain of distribution between General and the ultimate retail outlet. Plaintiffs claimed, counsel said, that pressure was exerted to terminate the relationship between General and Olympic, and thereby between Olympic and plaintiffs, as the result of an industry commitment to do away with subdistributorship operations \"because the sub-distributorship could not be controlled. The gasoline could be controlled, obviously, when General Petroleum sold it directly at retail. The gasoline could be controlled if you had a good company as opposed to a bad company, which was acting as a distributor. But the gasoline could not be controlled when it went to the sub-distributorship level.\" Clearly this is a claim that in order to obtain and to maintain control of distribution and retail marketing, including the control and fixing of uniform wholesale and retail prices of which the government action complained, defendants agreed to tighten control of the chain of distribution through elimination of independent jobbers acting as subdistributors. Counsel's statements simply filled out the details of the general allegations of the complaint.\n\nAs we have concluded that the running of the statute of limitations was suspended, the judgment must be\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN and MR.

WALKER(1965)\nNo. 95\nArgued: March 11, 1965Decided: June 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted of burglary by a Louisiana court and his conviction was affirmed by the highest state court. Thereafter, in Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n, this Court held that evidence illegally seized is inadmissible in a state criminal trial, and petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The writ was denied by the federal District Court and by the Court of Appeals, which found the searches of petitioner's person and property illegal but held that the Mapp exclusionary rule was not retrospective. Held: The exclusionary rule announced in Mapp does not apply to state court convictions which had become final before its rendition. Pp. 622-640.\n\n (a) The effect of a subsequent ruling of invalidity on prior final judgments when collaterally attacked is not automatic retroactive invalidity but depends upon a consideration of particular relations and conduct, or rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality, and of public policy in the light of the nature of the statute and its previous application. Chicot Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, \n308 \nU.S. 371\n. P. 627.\n\n\n (b) No distinction is drawn between civil and criminal litigation. P. 627.\n\n\n (c) The Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retroactive effect and in each case the Court determines whether retroactive or prospective application is appropriate. This approach is particularly correct with reference to the unreasonable search and seizure proscription of the Fourth Amendment. P. 629.\n\n\n (d) The primary purpose of Mapp v. Ohio was the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment through the inclusion of the exclusionary rule within its rights, and this purpose would not be advanced by making the rule retroactive. Pp. 636-637.\n\n\n (e) Other areas in which rules have been applied retrospectively concerned the fairness of the trial, which is not under attack here. P. 639. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 619]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (f) The date of the seizure in Mapp (which preceded that here) is of no legal significance; the crucial date is the date of the Mapp judgment which changed the rule.

Richard Uviller and Michael Juviler filed a supplementary memorandum on behalf of the National District Attorneys' Association, as amicus curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n (1961), we held that the exclusion of evidence seized in violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment was required of the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In so doing we overruled Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n (1949), to the extent that it failed to apply the exclusionary rule to the States.\n1\n This case presents the question of whether this requirement operates retrospectively upon cases finally decided in the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 620]\n\u00a0\n period prior to Mapp. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that it did not, 323 F.2d 11, and we granted certiorari in order to settle what has become a most troublesome question in the administration of justice.\n2\n\u00a0\n377 \nU.S. 930\n. We agree with the Court of Appeals. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 621]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner was convicted in a Louisiana District Court on May 28, 1959, of \"simple burglary.\" At the time of his arrest he had been under surveillance for two days as a suspect in connection with another burglary. He was taken to the police station, searched, and keys were taken from his person. After he was booked and placed in jail, other officers took his keys, entered and searched his home, and seized certain property and papers. Later his place of business was entered and searched and seizures were effected. These intrusions were made without a warrant. The State District Court held that the arresting officers had reasonable cause for the arrest under Louisiana law and finding probable cause to search as an incident to arrest it held the seizures valid. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed in February 1960.\n\nOn June 19, 1961, Mapp was announced. Immediately thereafter petitioner filed an application for habeas corpus in the state court on the basis of Mapp. The writ being denied in the Louisiana courts, he then filed a like application in the United States District Court. After denial there he appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed. It found the searches too remote from the arrest and therefore illegal but held that the constitutional requirement of exclusion of the evidence under Mapp was not retrospective. Petitioner has two points: (1) that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Mapp was not retrospective; and (2) that even though Mapp be held not to operate retrospectively, the search in his case was subsequent to that in Mapp, and while his final conviction was long prior to our disposition of it, his case should nevertheless be governed by Mapp.\n\nInitially we must consider the term \"retrospective\" for the purposes of our opinion. A ruling which is purely prospective does not apply even to the parties before the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 622]\n\u00a0\n court.\n3\n See, e. g., England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411\n (1964). See also Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358\n (1932). However, we are not here concerned with pure prospectively since we applied the rule announced in Mapp to reverse Miss Mapp's conviction. That decision has also been applied to cases still pending on direct review at the time it was rendered.\n4\n Therefore, in this case, we are concerned only with whether the exclusionary principle enunciated in Mapp applies to state court convictions which had become final\n5\n before rendition of our opinion.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWhile to some it may seem \"academic\" it might be helpful to others for us to briefly outline the history and theory of the problem presented.\n\nAt common law there was no authority for the proposition that judicial decisions made law only for the future.\n6\n Blackstone stated the rule that the duty of the court was not to \"pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 623]\n\u00a0\n the old one.\" 1 Blackstone, Commentaries 69 (15th ed. 1809).\n7\n This Court followed that rule in Norton v. Shelby County, \n118 \nU.S. 425\n (1886),\n8\n holding that unconstitutional action \"confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.\" At 442. The judge rather than being the creator of the law was but its discoverer. Gray, Nature and Sources of the Law 222 (1st ed. 1909). In the case of the overruled decision, Wolf v. Colorado, supra, here, it was thought to be only a failure at true discovery and was consequently never the law; while the overruling one. Mapp, was not \"new law but an application of what is, and therefore had been, the true law.\" Shulman, Retroactive Legislation, 13 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 355, 356 (1934).\n\nOn the other hand, Austin maintained that judges do in fact do something more than discover law: they make \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 624]\n\u00a0\n it interstitially by filling in with judicial interpretation the vague, indefinite, or generic statutory or common-law terms that alone are but the empty crevices of the law. Implicit in such an approach is the admission when a case is overruled that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. However, rather than being erased by the later overruling decision it is considered as an existing juridical fact until overruled, and intermediate cases finally decided under it are not to be disturbed.\n\nThe Blackstonian view ruled English jurisprudence and cast its shadow over our own as evidenced by Norton v. Shelby County, supra. However, some legal philosophers continued to insist that such a rule was out of tune with actuality largely because judicial repeal of time did \"work hardship to those who [had] trusted to its existence.\" Cardozo, Address to the N. Y. Bar Assn., 55 Rep. N. Y. State Bar Assn. 263, 296-297 (1932). The Austinian view gained some acceptance over a hundred years ago when it was decided that although legislative divorces were illegal and void, those previously granted were immunized by a prospective application of the rule of the case. Bingham v. Miller, 17 Ohio 445 (1848). And as early as 1863 this Court drew on the same concept in Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175 (1863). The Supreme Court of Iowa had repeatedly held that the Iowa Legislature had the power to authorize municipalities to issue bonds to aid in the construction of railroads. After the City of Dubuque had issued such bonds, the Iowa Supreme Court reversed itself and held that the legislature lacked such power. In Gelpcke, which arose after the overruling decision, this Court held that the bonds issued under the apparent authority granted by the legislature were collectible. \"However we may regard the late [overruling] case in Iowa as affecting the future, it can have no effect upon the past.\" At 206. The theory was, as Mr. Justice Holmes stated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 625]\n\u00a0\n 371 (1910), \"that a change of judicial decision after a contract has been made on the faith of an earlier one the other way is a change of the law.\" And in 1932 Mr. Justice Cardozo in Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358\n, applied the Austinian approach in denying a federal constitutional due process attack on the prospective application of a decision of the Montana Supreme Court. He said that a State \"may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.\" At 364. Mr. Justice Cardozo based the rule on the avoidance of \"injustice or hardship\" citing a long list of state and federal cases supporting the principle that the courts had the power to say that decisions though later overruled \"are law none the less for intermediate transactions.\" At 364. Eight years later Chief Justice Hughes in Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, \n308 \nU.S. 371\n (1940), in discussing the problem made it clear that the board statements of Norton, supra, \"must be taken with qualifications.\" He reasoned that the actual existence of the law prior to the determination of unconstitutionality \"is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.\" He laid down the rule that the \"effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects.\" At 374.\n\nOne form of limited retraction which differs somewhat from the type discussed above is that which was established in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801). There, a schooner had been seized under an order of the President which commanded that any armed French vessel found on the high seas be captured. An order of condemnation was entered on September 23, 1800. However, while the case was pending before this Court the United States signed an agreement with France providing that any property captured and not \"definitively \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 626]\n\u00a0\n condemned\" should be restored. Chief Justice Marshall said:\n\n \"It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied . . . [and] where individual rights . . . are sacrificed for national purposes . . . the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment . . . which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside.\" At 110.\n\n\n This same approach was subsequently applied in instances where a statutory change intervened, Carpenter v. Wabash R. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 23\n (1940); where a constitutional amendment was adopted, United States v. Chambers, \n291 \nU.S. 217\n (1934);\n9\n and where judicial decision altered or overruled earlier case law, Vandenbark v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n311 \nU.S. 538\n (1941).\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 627]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder our cases it appears (1) that a change in law will be given effect while a case is on direct review, Schooner Peggy, supra,\n11\n and (2) that the effect of the subsequent ruling of invalidity on prior final judgments when collaterally attacked is subject to no set \"principle of absolute retroactive invalidity\" but depends upon a consideration of \"particular relations . . . and particular conduct . . . of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality\"; and \"of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application.\" Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, supra, at 374.\n\nThat no distinction was drawn between civil and criminal litigation is shown by the language used not only in Schooner Peggy, supra, and Chicot County, supra, but also in such cases as State v. Jones, 44 N. M. 623, 107 P.2d 324 (1940) and James v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 213\n (1961). In the latter case, this Court laid down a prospective principle in overruling Commissioner v. Wilcox, \n327 \nU.S. 404\n (1946), \"in a manner that will not prejudice those who might have relied on it.\"\n12\n At 221. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 628]\n\u00a0\n Thus, the accepted rule today is that in appropriate cases the Court may in the interest of justice make the rule prospective. And \"there is much to be said in favor of such a rule for cases arising in the future.\" Mosser v. Darrow, \n341 \nU.S. 267\n, at 276 (dissenting opinion of BLACK, J.).\n\nWhile the cases discussed above deal with the invalidity of statutes or the effect of a decision overturning long-established common-law rules, there seems to be no impediment - constitutional or philosophical - to the use of the same rule in the constitutional area where the exigencies of the situation require such an application. It is true that heretofore, without discussion, we have applied new constitutional rules to cases finalized before the promulgation of the rule.\n13\n Petitioner contends that our \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 629]\n\u00a0\n method of resolving those prior cases demonstrates that an absolute rule of retroaction prevails in the area of constitutional adjudication. However, we believe that the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect. As Justice Cardozo said, \"We think the federal constitution has no voice upon the subject.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\nOnce the premise is accepted that we are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively, we must then weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation. We believe that this approach is particularly correct with reference to the Fourth Amendment's prohibitions as to unreasonable searches and seizures. Rather than \"disparaging\" the Amendment we but apply the wisdom of Justice Holmes that \"[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\" Holmes, The Common Law 5 (Howe ed. 1963).\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\nSince Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n (1914), this Court has adhered to the rule that evidence seized by federal officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 630]\n\u00a0\n is not admissible at trial in a federal court. In 1949 in Wolf v. Colorado, supra, the Court decided that while the right to privacy - \"the core of the Fourth Amendment\" - was such a basic right as to be implicit in \"the concept of ordered liberty\" and thus enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, \"the ways of enforcing such a basic right raise questions of a different order. How such arbitrary conduct should be checked, what remedies against it should be afforded, the means by which the right should be made effective, are all questions that are not to be so dogmatically answered as to preclude the varying solutions which spring from an allowable range of judgment on issues not susceptible of quantitative solution.\" At 27-28.\n\nThe Court went on to say that the federal exclusionary rule was not \"derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment . . . . The decision was a matter of judicial implication.\" At 28. Since \"we find that in fact most of the English-speaking world does not regard as vital to such protection the exclusion of evidence thus obtained, we must hesitate to treat this remedy as an essential ingredient of the right.\"\n16\n At 29. While granting that \"in practice\" the exclusion of evidence might be \"an effective way of deterring unreasonable searches,\" the Court concluded that it could not \"condemn as falling below the minimal standards assured by the Due Process Clause a State's reliance upon other methods which, if consistently enforced, would be equally effective.\" At 31. The continuance of the federal exclusionary rule was excused on the ground that the reasons for it were more \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 631]\n\u00a0\n \"compelling\" since public opinion in the community could be exerted against oppressive conduct by local police far more effectively than it could throughout the country.\n\nThe \"asymmetry which Wolf imported into the law,\" Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 670 (concurring opinion of DOUGLAS, J.), was indicated by a decision announced on the same day, Lustig v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 74\n (1949), holding that evidence given to federal authorities \"on a silver platter\" by state officers was not excludable in federal trials. At 79. Wolf's holding, in conjunction with the \"silver platter\" doctrine of Lustig, provided wide avenues of abuse in the Weeks' exclusionary rule in the federal courts. Evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment by state officers was turned over to federal officers and admitted in evidence in prosecutions in the federal courts. In 1951 Wolf was strengthened by Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117\n, in which the Court refused to permit a federal court to enjoin the use of evidence in a state criminal proceeding that had been illegally seized by state officers. In 1952, however, the Court could not tolerate the procedure involved in Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n, where morphine capsules pumped from the accused's stomach by state officers were admitted in evidence in a state court. It struck down the conviction on due process grounds under the Fourteenth Amendment because the action was shocking to the conscience. In 1954 came Irvine v. California, \n347 \nU.S. 128\n, in which the State admitted evidence procured via a microphone secreted clandestinely by state police in the accused's bedroom. These \"incredible\" circumstances did not sufficiently shock the conscience of the Court into applying the Rochin test. Instead the case went off on the doctrine of Wolf. Mr. Justice Jackson in announcing the judgment of the Court overruled those who urged that Wolf \"applies only to searches and seizures which produce on our minds \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 632]\n\u00a0\n a mild shock, while if the shock is more serious, the states must exclude the evidence or we will reverse the conviction.\" At 133-134. He strongly reaffirmed Wolf stating:\n\n\"Now that the Wolf doctrine is known to them, state courts may wish further to reconsider their evidentiary rules. But to upset state convictions even before the states have had adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the rule would be an unwarranted use of federal power.\" At 134.\n\n\n The opinion in dealing with the operation of the exclusionary rule said that it \"must be remembered that petitioner is not invoking the Constitution to prevent or punish a violation of his federal right recognized in Wolf . . . . He is invoking it only to set aside his own conviction of crime. . . . Rejection of the evidence does nothing to punish the wrong-doing official, while it may, and likely will, release the wrong-doing defendant . . . . [It] does nothing to protect innocent persons who are the victims of illegal but fruitless searches.\" At 136. Admitting the futility of other remedies available to the victims of illegal searches, Mr. Justice Jackson and the then Chief Justice suggested that the \"Clerk of this Court should be directed to forward a copy of the record in this case, together with a copy of this opinion, for attention of the Attorney General of the United States\" with a view to prosecution under the Civil Rights Act, 62 Stat. 696, 18 U.S.C. 242 (1958 ed.). In concurring in the judgment in Irvine the writer of this opinion indicated his displeasure with Wolf but observed that since the Court \"still refuses today\" to overrule it he felt bound by Wolf but had hopes that \"strict adherence to the tenor of that decision may produce needed converts for its extinction.\" At 138-139. The Court continued to broaden the rule of exclusion when, in 1956, it held that a federal agent might be enjoined from transferring to state authorities evidence that he \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 633]\n\u00a0\n had seized on an illegal federal warrant, or testifying with regard to it in a state prosecution. Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n. In 1960 the Court's dissatisfaction with the \"silver platter\" doctrine, Lustig v. United States, supra, led to its rejection in the leading case of Elkins v. United States, \n364 \nU.S. 206\n. The factual situation being the converse of Rea v. United States, supra, the Court tightened the noose of exclusion in order to strangle completely the use in the federal courts of evidence illegally seized by state agents. It was in Elkins that the Court emphasized that the exclusionary rule was \"calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter - to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way - by removing the incentive to disregard it.\"\n17\n At 217.\n\nMapp was announced in 1961. The Court in considering \"the current validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based\" pointed out that prior to Wolf \"almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it . . . have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.\" At 651. We then cited California as typical of those adopting the rule since Wolf. It was \"`compelled to reach that conclusion.'\" we said, quoting California's highest court, \"`because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions . . . .' People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434 . . . \" We went on to find that \"[t]he experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States. The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been recognized \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 634]\n\u00a0\n by this Court since Wolf. See Irvine v. California . . . .\" At 652-653. In discussing People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N. E. 585, upon which Wolf heavily relied, we concluded that \"Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the `weighty testimony' of People v. Defore . . . `that [t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.' 242 N. Y., at 22.\" At 653. We concluded that \"the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court,\" at 653. which had closed all of the courtroom doors \"open to evidence secured by official lawlessness . . .\" save that of the state courts. At 655. That door was closed by Mapp.\n\nIn recapitulation, we found in Mapp that Wolf rested on these grounds. First, that the \"contrariety of views of the States\" as to the use of the exclusionary rule was \"particularly impressive.\" Second, \"`other means of protection' [of Fourth Amendment rights] ha[d] been afforded\" than the exclusionary rule. And, third, the \"weighty testimony\" of People v. Defore, supra. As to the first, we found the lineup of the States as to the exclusionary rule had shifted to where a majority favored it; as to the second, that the other means of protection had proven to be \"worthless and futile\" and had not reduced the incidence of police lawlessness during the 12 years since Wolf was announced but that Wolf had operated as a license for police illegality; and, as to the third, that our cases subsequent to Mapp had completely closed the laxity in the federal exclusionary rule complained of in People v. Defore, supra. We also affirmatively found that the exclusionary rule was \"an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\" and the only effective remedy for the protection of rights under the Fourth Amendment; that it would stop the needless \"shopping around\" that was causing conflict between federal and state courts, as was permitted in Wilson v. Schnettler, \n365 \nU.S. 381\n (1961); that it would withdraw the invitation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 635]\n\u00a0\n which Wolf extended to federal officers to step across the street to the state's attorney with their illegal evidence, thus eliminating a practice which tended to destroy the entire system of constitutional restraints on which the liberties of the people rest; that it would promote state-federal cooperation in law enforcement by rejecting the double standard of admissibility of illegal evidence which tends to breed suspicion among the officers, encourages disobedience to the Constitution on the part of all the participants and violates \"the imperative of judicial integrity.\" Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 657-660. In short, just as other cases had found the exclusionary rule to be a deterrent safeguard necessary to the enforcement of the Amendment, Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385\n (1920), Mapp bottomed its rule on its necessity as a \"sanction upon which [the Fourth Amendment's] protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases.\" At 655. Mapp's rationale was that since Wolf we had on an ad hoc basis been led to exclude all evidence in both state and federal courts where a federal agent had participated in the illegal search. Only a few States had made any changes in their rule of admissibility since Wolf and many of those not following the federal exclusionary rule were, in effect, using Wolf as a license to violate the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures as applied to the States by the Wolf case itself. As we noted in Mapp \"further delay in [applying the exclusionary rule to the States] could have no effect other than to compound the difficulties\"; a definitive continuance of Wolf might have increased the number of cases involving illegal searches in non-exclusionary States and also enticed those in the exclusionary column to reverse their position, as some States had done prior to Mapp. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 636]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWe believe that the existence of the Wolf doctrine prior to Mapp is \"an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.\" Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, supra, at 374. The thousands of cases that were finally decided on Wolf cannot be obliterated. The \"particular conduct, private and official,\" must be considered. Here \"prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly\" have \"become vested.\" And finally, \"public policy in the light of the nature both of the . . . [Wolf doctrine] and of its previous application\" must be given its proper weight. Ibid. In short, we must look to the purpose of the Mapp rule; the reliance placed upon the Wolf doctrine; and the effect on the administration of justice of a retrospective application of Mapp.\n\nIt is clear that the Wolf Court, once it had found the Fourth Amendment's unreasonable Search and Seizure Clause applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, turned its attention to whether the exclusionary rule was included within the command of the Fourth Amendment. This was decided in the negative. It is clear that based upon the factual considerations heretofore discussed the Wolf Court then concluded that it was not necessary to the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment for the exclusionary rule to be extended to the States as a requirement of due process. Mapp had as its prime purpose the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment through the inclusion of the exclusionary rule within its rights. This, it was found, was the only effective deterrent to lawless police action. Indeed, all of the cases since Wolf requiring the exclusion of illegal evidence have been based on the necessity for an effective deterrent to illegal police \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 637]\n\u00a0\n action. See, e. g., Rea v. United States, supra. We cannot say that this purpose would be advanced by making the rule retrospective. The misconduct of the police prior to Mapp has already occurred and will not be corrected by releasing the prisoners involved. Nor would it add harmony to the delicate state-federal relationship of which we have spoken as part and parcel of the purpose of Mapp. Finally, the ruptured privacy of the victims' homes and effects cannot be restored. Reparation comes too late.\n\nIt is true that both the accused and the States relied upon Wolf. Indeed, Wolf and Irvine each pointed the way for the victims of illegal searches to seek reparation for the violation of their privacy. Some pursued the same. See Monroe v. Pape, \n365 \nU.S. 167\n (1961). In addition, in Irvine, a flag in a concurring opinion warned that Wolf was in stormy weather. On the other hand, the States relied on Wolf and followed its command. Final judgments of conviction were entered prior to Mapp. Again and again this Court refused to reconsider Wolf and gave its implicit approval to hundreds of cases in their application of its rule. In rejecting the Wolf doctrine as to the exclusionary rule the purpose was to deter the lawless action of the police and to effectively enforce the Fourth Amendment. That purpose will not at this late date be served by the wholesale release of the guilty victims.\n\nFinally, there are interests in the administration of justice and the integrity of the judicial process to consider. To make the rule of Mapp retrospective would tax the administration of justice to the utmost. Hearings would have to be held on the excludability of evidence long since destroyed, misplaced or deteriorated. If it is excluded, the witnesses available at the time of the original trial will not be available or if located their memory will be dimmed. To thus legitimate such an extraordinary \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 638]\n\u00a0\n procedural weapon that has no bearing on guilt would seriously disrupt the administration of justice.\n\nIt is urged, however, that these same considerations apply in the cases that we have applied retrospectively in other areas,\n18\n notably that of coerced confessions, and that the Mapp exclusionary rule should, therefore, be given the same dignity and effect. Two cases are cited, Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391\n (1963), and Reck v. Pate, \n367 \nU.S. 433\n (1961), but neither is apposite. It is said that we ordered new trials 25 years after conviction in the latter and after the lapse of 21 years in the former. This time table is true but that is all. The principle that a coerced confession is not admissible in a trial predated the arrests as well as the original convictions in each of these cases. See Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n (1936). There was no question of retrospective operation involved in either case. Moreover, coerced confessions are excluded from evidence because of \"a complex of values,\" Blackburn v. Alabama, \n361 \nU.S. 199\n (1960), including \"the likelihood that the confession is untrue\"; \"the preservation of the individual's freedom of will\"; and \"`[t]he abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions.'\" At 207. Cited with approval in Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368, 385\n-386 (1964). But there is no likelihood of unreliability or coercion present in a search-and-seizure case. Rather than being abhorrent at the time of seizure in this case, the use in state trials of illegally seized evidence had been specifically authorized by this Court in Wolf.\n19\n Furthermore, in Noia, the confession was admittedly coerced and the sole issue involved the availability of federal habeas corpus in a state conviction, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 639]\n\u00a0\n where state post-conviction remedies had been exhausted but the accused had failed to appeal from his original conviction. Nothing of that kind is involved here and this holding has no bearing whatever on Noia or Reck, for that matter. Finally, in each of the three areas in which we have applied our rule retrospectively\n20\n the principle that we applied went to the fairness of the trial - the very integrity of the fact-finding process. Here, as we have pointed out, the fairness of the trial is not under attack. All that petitioner attacks is the admissibility of evidence, the reliability and relevancy of which is not questioned, and which may well have had no effect on the outcome.\n\nNor can we accept the contention of petitioner that the Mapp rule should date from the day of the seizure there, rather than that of the judgment of this Court. The date of the seizure in Mapp has no legal significance. It was the judgment of this Court that changed the rule and the date of that opinion is the crucial date. In the light of the cases of this Court this is the better cutoff time. See United States v. Schooner Peggy, supra.\n\nAll that we decide today is that though the error complained of might be fundamental it is not of the nature \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 640]\n\u00a0\n requiring us to overturn all final convictions based upon it. After full consideration of all the factors we are not able to say that the Mapp rule requires retrospective application.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although Mapp may not be considered to be an overruling decision in the sense that it did not disturb the earlier holding of Wolf that the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment are applicable to the States, its effect certainly was to change existing law with regard to enforcement of the right.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A split of authority has developed in the various courts of appeals concerning the retrospectivity of Mapp. Compare Hall v. Warden, 313 F.2d 483 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1963) (retroactive); Walker v. Peppersack, 316 F.2d 119 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1963) (retroactive), California v. Hurst, 325 F.2d 891 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1963) (retroactive), with Gaitan v. United States, 317 F.2d 494 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1963) (prospective); Linkletter v. Walker, 323 F.2d 11 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1963) (prospective); Sisk v. Lane, 331 F.2d 235 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1964) (prospective); United States ex rel. Angelet v. Fay, 333 F.2d 12 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1964) (prospective).\n\nAbout the only point upon which there was agreement in the cases cited was that our opinion in Mapp did not foreclose the question.\n\nThe state courts which have considered the question have almost unanimously decided against application to cases finalized prior to Mapp. See, e. g., Beltowski v. Tahash, 266 Minn. 182, 123 N. W. 2d 207, cert. denied, \n375 \nU.S. 947\n (1963); Moore v. State, 274 Ala. 276, 147 So.2d 835 (1962), cert. denied, \n374 \nU.S. 811\n (1963); People v. Muller, 11 N. Y. 2d 154, 182 N. E. 2d 99, cert. denied, \n371 \nU.S. 850\n (1962).\n\nCommentators have also split over the question of absolute retroactivity. See Bender, The Retroactive Effect of an Overruling Constitutional Decision: Mapp v. Ohio, 110 U. Pa. L. Rev. 650 (1962); Freund, New Vistas in Constitutional Law, 112 U. Pa. L.

Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, \n375 \nU.S. 411\n (1964). See also Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12, 20\n (1956) (concurring opinion of Frankfurter, J.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Ker v.

Ohio.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"I know of no authority in this court to say that in general state decisions shall make law only for the future. Judicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a thousand years.\" Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349, 372\n (1910) (dissenting opinion of Holmes, J.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] While Blackstone is always cited as the foremost exponent of the declaratory theory, a very similar view was stated by Sir Matthew Hale in his History of the Common Law which was published 13 years before the birth of Blackstone. Gray, Nature and Sources of the Law 206 (1st ed. 1909).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It is interesting to note, however, that as early as 1801, Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, had made clear that\n\n\"if subsequent to the judgment [in the trial court] and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs . . . the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment . . . which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside.\" At 110.\n\n\n Petitioner maintains that this case establishes a rule of absolute retroactivity and that the principle is the same with regard to constitutional rights. Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the case stands for the proposition for which he contends, i. e., that a change in the law will be given effect while a case is on direct review, but cannot be necessarily invoked on collateral attack.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \"Because this was a criminal prosecution, it builds not only upon the cases which followed Schooner Peggy but also upon the principle, established at common law, that repeal of a penal statute prohibits prosecution of acts committed before the repeal if those acts had not yet been prosecuted to final judgment. The repeal is regarded as an indication that the state no longer wants such acts punished, regardless of when they took place, and no longer views them as criminal.\" Note, 71 Yale L. J. 907, 914 (1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This was a diversity case in which this Court held that the doctrine of Schooner Peggy, in effect, was incorporated in Eric R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n. \"A federal court sitting in a diversity case must therefore apply the most recent state court decision, even if it came after the operative events or the entry of judgment by a lower court.\" Note, 71 Yale L. J. 907, 915 (1962). See, e. g., Blaauw v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 127\n (1965).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Accord, Carpenter v. Wabash R. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 23\n (1940) (intervening statutory change); Vandenbark v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n311 \nU.S. 538\n and cases cited at 541-542 (1941); Dinsmore v. Southern Express Co., \n183 \nU.S. 115, 120\n (1901) (intervening statutory change); Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 \nU.S. 290, 308\n (1912) (intervening statutory change).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] There was no mention of prospective overruling in the opinion, however three Justices voted to overrule Wilcox but reversed James' conviction because \"the element of willfulness could not be proven in a criminal prosecution for failing to include embezzled funds in gross income in the year of misappropriation so long as the statute contained the gloss placed upon it by Wilcox at the time the alleged crime was committed.\" \n366 \nU.S. 213, 221\n-222. MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurred in the reversal of the conviction on the basis that Wilcox was right and therefore failure to include \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 628]\n\u00a0\n embezzled funds in taxable income was not a crime. However, MR. JUSTICE BLACK strongly disagreed with the prospective manner in which the overruling was done.\n\n\"[O]ne of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's departure from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking has been the fact that its judgments could not be limited to prospective application. This Court and in fact all departments of the Government have always heretofore realized that prospective lawmaking is the function of Congress rather than of the courts. We continue to think that this function should be exercised only by Congress under our constitutional system.\" \n366 \nU.S., at 225\n.\n\n\n Compare the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK in Mosser v. Darrow, \n341 \nU.S. 267, 275\n (1951), where he stated that a new rule of trustee liability should not be applied retroactively. For discussion of these cases see Currier, supra, n. 2; Note, 71 Yale L. J. 907.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board, \n357 \nU.S. 214\n (1958), applied the rule of Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12\n (1956), requiring the State to furnish transcripts of the trial to indigents on appeal, to a 1935 conviction. The rule in Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n (1963), that counsel must be appointed to represent an indigent charged with a felony, was actually applied retrospectively in that case since Gideon had collaterally attacked the prior judgment by post-conviction remedies. See also Doughty v. Maxwell, \n376 \nU.S. 202\n (1964). Jackson v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 368\n (1964), involving a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 629]\n\u00a0\n coerced confession, was also applied to the petitioner who was here on a collateral attack. See also McNerlin v. Denno, \n378 \nU.S. 575\n (1964). It is also contended that Reck v. Pate, \n367 \nU.S. 433\n (1961), supports the conclusion of absolute retroactivity in the constitutional area since the petitioner convicted in 1937 was released after a finding that the confession was coerced when judged by standards set forth in our cases decided subsequent to his conviction. See United States ex rel. Angelet v. Fay, 333 F.2d 12, 24 (dissenting opinion of Marshall, J.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 364\n (1932) (referring to state court's prospective overruling of prior decision).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 661\n-662 (1961) (concurring opinion of BLACK, J.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] There the Court detailed the lineup of the States on the exclusionary rule before and after Weeks pointing out that at the time of the decision 31 States rejected the rule and 16 States were in agreement with it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] In an Appendix to the opinion, the lineup of States regarding the exclusion of illegally seized evidence was catalogued, indicating that there was some change since Wolf - 26 States excluded such evidence while 24 did not. At 224-225.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] See cases cited in n. 13, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Indeed, MR. JUSTICE BLACK in concurring said \"that the federal exclusionary rule is not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.\" \n338 \nU.S. 25\n, at 39-40.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] In Griffin v. Illinois, supra, the appeal which was denied because of lack of funds was \"an integral part of the [State's] trial system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a defendant.\" At 18. Precluding an appeal because of inability to pay was analogized to denying the poor a fair trial. In Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, we recognized a fundamental fact that a layman, no matter how intelligent, could not possibly further his claims of innocence and violation of previously declared rights adequately. Because of this the judgment lacked reliability. In Jackson v. Denno, supra, the holding went to the basis of fair hearing and trial because the procedural apparatus never assured the defendant a fair determination of voluntariness. In addition, MR. JUSTICE WHITE expressed grave doubts regarding the ability of the jury to disregard a confession found to be involuntary if the question of guilt was uncertain.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court of Appeals held, and this Court now concedes, that the petitioner Linkletter is presently in prison serving a nine-year sentence at hard labor for burglary under a 1959 Louisiana State Court conviction obtained by use of evidence unreasonably seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. On June 19, 1961, we decided Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n, in which the Court specifically held that \"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.\" \n367 \nU.S., at 655\n. Stating that this Court had previously held in Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n, that the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court in Mapp went on to add:\n\n\"In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by Wolf could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure. To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.\" \n367 \nU.S., at 656\n.\n\n\n Despite the Court's resounding promises throughout the Mapp opinion that convictions based on such \"unconstitutional evidence\" would \"`find no sanction in the judgments \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 641]\n\u00a0\n of the courts,'\" Linkletter, convicted in the state court by use of \"unconstitutional evidence,\" is today denied relief by the judgment of this Court because his conviction became \"final\" before Mapp was decided. Linkletter must stay in jail; Miss Mapp, whose offense was committed before Linkletter's, is free. This different treatment of Miss Mapp and Linkletter points up at once the arbitrary and discriminatory nature of the judicial contrivance utilized here to break the promise of Mapp by keeping all people in jail who are unfortunate enough to have had their unconstitutional convictions affirmed before June 19, 1961.\n\nMiss Mapp's Ohio offense was committed May 23, 1957; Linkletter's Louisiana offense occurred more than a year later - August 16, 1958. Linkletter was tried in Louisiana, convicted, the State Supreme Court affirmed, and a rehearing was denied March 21, 1960, all within about one year and seven months after his offense was committed. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Miss Mapp's conviction March 23, 1960, approximately two years and 10 months after her offense. Thus, had the Ohio courts proceeded with the same expedition as those in Louisiana, or had the Louisiana courts proceeded as slowly as the Ohio courts, Linkletter's conviction would not have been \"finally\" decided within the Court's definition of \"finally\" until within about 10 days of the time Miss Mapp's case was decided in this Court - which would have given Linkletter ample time to petition this Court for virtually automatic relief on direct review after the Mapp case was decided. The Court offers no defense based on any known principle of justice for discriminating among defendants who were similarly convicted by use of evidence unconstitutionally seized. It certainly cannot do so as between Linkletter and Miss Mapp. The crime with which she was charged took \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 642]\n\u00a0\n place more than a year before his, yet the decision today seems to rest on the fanciful concept that the Fourth Amendment protected her 1957 offense against conviction by use of unconstitutional evidence but denied its protection to Linkletter for his 1958 offense. In making this ruling the Court assumes for itself the virtue of acting in harmony with a comment of Justice Holmes that \"[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\"\n1\n Justice Holmes was not there talking about the Constitution; he was talking about the evolving judge-made law of England and of some of our States whose judges are allowed to follow in the common law tradition. It should be remembered in this connection that no member of this Court has ever more seriously criticized it than did Justice Holmes for reading its own predilections into the \"vague contours\" of the Due Process Clause.\n2\n But quite apart from that, there is no experience of the past that justifies a new Court-made rule to perpetrate a grossly invidious and unfair discrimination against Linkletter simply because he happened to be prosecuted in a State that was evidently well up with its criminal court docket. If this discrimination can be excused at all it is not because of experience but because of logic - sterile and formal at that - not, according to Justice Holmes, the most dependable guide in lawmaking.\n\nWhen we get beyond the way the new rule works as between people situated like Linkletter and Miss Mapp, the new contrivance stands no better. I say \"new\" because the Court admits, as it must, that \"It is true that heretofore, without discussion, we have applied new constitutional rules to cases finalized before the promulgation of the rule.\" Ante, p. 628. And the Court also refers to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 643]\n\u00a0\n a number of cases in which that practice has been followed. For example, in Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12\n, where we announced that a pauper could not be denied the right to appeal because of his indigency, a suggestion was made in a concurring opinion that the Court should apply its new rule to future cases only. Id., at 25-26. However, in 1958 this Court did apply the Griffin rule to a conviction obtained in 1935, over the dissents of two Justices who said that the Griffin case decided in 1956 should not determine the constitutionality of the petitioner's 1935 conviction. Eskridge v. Washington, \n357 \nU.S. 214\n.\n\nInteresting as the question may be abstractly, this case should not be decided on the basis of arguments about whether judges \"make\" law or \"discover\" it when performing their duty of interpreting the Constitution. This Court recognized in Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, \n308 \nU.S. 371, 374\n, an opinion in which I joined, that \"an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified.\" And where state courts in certain situations chose to apply their decisions to the future only, this Court also said that, \"the federal constitution has no voice\" forbidding them to do so. Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Ref. Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 364\n. But cf. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349, 372\n (dissenting opinion). In stating this Court's position on the question, the opinion in the Chicot County case recognized that rights and interests may have resulted from the existence and operation of a statute which should be respected notwithstanding its later being declared unconstitutional:\n\n\"The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration. The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects, - with respect to particular relations, individual \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 644]\n\u00a0\n and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application, demand examination.\" \n308 \nU.S., at 374\n.\n\n\n Thus in Mosser v. Darrow, \n341 \nU.S. 267\n, when this Court created an entirely new rule imposing heavy financial liability on a trustee in bankruptcy for acts which at the time he performed them had been perfectly valid under the law, I dissented, stating my belief that although there was \"much to be said in favor of such a rule [of trustee liability] for cases arising in the future,\" \n341 \nU.S., at 276\n, it should not be applied against trustees who had in good faith relied on the existence of a different rule in the past. On the other hand, in James v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 213\n, I suggested in an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joined, that there were objections having a peculiar force in the field of criminal law to a judicial rule to the effect that courts \"should make their decisions as to what the law is apply only prospectively.\" A major basis for what we said there was stated this way:\n\n\"Our trouble with this aspect of the Court's action is that it seems to us to indicate that the Court has passed beyond the interpretation of the tax statute and proceeded substantially to amend it.\n\n\n .  .  . . .\n\n\n \"In our judgment one of the great inherent restraints upon this Court's departure from the field of interpretation to enter that of lawmaking has been the fact that its judgments could not be limited to prospective application.\" \n366 \nU.S., at 224\n-225.\n\n\n I adhere to my views in James, expressing opposition to a general rule that would always apply new interpretations \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 645]\n\u00a0\n of criminal laws prospectively. Doubtless there might be circumstances in which applying a new interpretation of the law to past events might lead to unjust consequences which, as we said in Chicot, \"cannot justly be ignored.\" No such unjust consequences to Linkletter, however, can possibly result here by giving him and others like him the benefit of a changed constitutional interpretation where he is languishing in jail on the basis of evidence concededly used unconstitutionally to convict him. And I simply cannot believe that the State of Louisiana has any \"vested interest\" that we should recognize in these circumstances in order to keep Linkletter in jail. I therefore would follow this Court's usual practice and apply the Mapp rule to unconstitutional convictions which have resulted in persons being presently in prison.\n\nIn refusing to give Linkletter the benefit of the Mapp rule, the Court expresses the view that its \"approach is particularly correct with reference to the Fourth Amendment's prohibitions as to unreasonable searches and seizures,\" indicating a disparaging view of the Fourth Amendment that leaves me somewhat puzzled after Mapp and other recent opinion talking about the indispensable protections of the Amendment. Ante, p. 629. Then the Court goes on to follow a recent pattern of balancing away Bill of Rights guarantees and balances away\n3\n in great part the Fourth Amendment safeguards one could reasonably have expected from the Mapp opinion and the opinion in Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391\n, which opened up to collateral attack all unconstitutional convictions even though \"final.\" Even using the Court's own balancing process, however, I think those now in prison under convictions resting on the use of unconstitutionally seized evidence should have their convictions set aside and be granted new trials conducted in conformity with the Constitution. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 646]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nAs the Court concedes, ante, p. 628, this is the first instance on record where this Court, having jurisdiction, has ever refused to give a previously convicted defendant the benefit of a new and more expansive Bill of Rights interpretation. I am at a loss to understand why those who suffer from the use of evidence secured by a search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment should be treated differently from those who have been denied other guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Speaking of the right guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments not to be convicted on \"unconstitutional evidence,\" the Court said in Mapp, only four years ago, that:\n\n\". . . we can no longer permit that right to remain an empty promise. Because it is enforceable in the same manner and to like effect as other basic rights secured by the Due Process Clause, we can no longer permit it to be revocable at the whim of any police officer who, in the name of law enforcement itself, chooses to suspend its enjoyment. Our decision, founded on reason and truth, gives to the individual no more than that which the Constitution guarantees him . . . .\" \n367 \nU.S., at 660\n. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Linkletter was convicted on \"unconstitutional evidence.\" He brought this federal habeas corpus proceeding seeking relief from his prior conviction, which this Court held in Fay v. Noia, \n372 \nU.S. 391\n, was the proper way to challenge a previous conviction unconstitutionally obtained. Evidence used against Noia, however, was not obtained by an unlawful search and seizure but by a coerced confession. Noia's conviction had taken place 21 years before his case reached this Court, and was therefore \"final.\" And in Reck v. Pate, \n367 \nU.S. 433\n, decided in 1961, this \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 647]\n\u00a0\n Court set aside the conviction of Reck for a 1936 offense on the ground that a coerced confession had been used against him.\n\nThere are peculiar reasons why the Mapp search and seizure exclusionary rule should be given like dignity and effect as the coerced confession exclusionary rule. Quite apart from the Court's positive statement in Mapp that the right guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments not to be convicted through use of unconstitutionally seized evidence should be given \"like effect as other basic rights secured by the Due Process Clause . . .,\" Mapp, like most other search and seizure exclusionary rule cases, relied heavily on Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n. In reaching the conclusion in Boyd that evidence obtained by unlawful search and seizure could not be admitted in evidence, the Boyd Court relied on the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compelling a man to be a witness against himself. The Boyd Court held that the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against self-incrimination gave constitutional justification to exclusion of evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure. The whole Court\n4\n treated such a search and seizure as compelling the person whose property was thus taken to give evidence against himself. There was certainly nothing in the Boyd case to indicate that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were to be given different dignity and respect in determining what, when and under what circumstances persons are entitled to their full protection. See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, \n380 \nU.S. 693, 703\n (concurring opinion). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 648]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis Court's opinion in Mapp not only by the express language already quoted but in numerous other places treated the two amendments as inseparable from the standpoint of the exclusionary rule. Speaking of the two, the Court said:\n\n\"[T]he very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence.\" \n367 \nU.S., at 657\n.\n\n\n Again the Court said in Mapp that:\n\n\"`[C]onviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions . . . should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts . . . .'\" Id., at 648.\n\n\n This statement appearing in Mapp had originally been made in Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 392\n. Weeks, which established the federal exclusionary rule for the first time, did so by relying greatly on the Boyd case and Boyd's treatment of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions as falling into precisely the same constitutional category. Yet the Court today by a chain of circuitous reasoning degrades the search and seizure exclusionary rule to a position far below that of the rule excluding evidence obtained by coerced confessions. The result is that this departure from the philosophy of Mapp denies Linkletter a right to challenge his conviction for an offense committed in August 1958 while it leaves Miss Mapp free because of an offense she committed in 1957.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nOne reason - perhaps a basic one - put forward by the Court for its refusal to give Linkletter the benefit of the search and seizure exclusionary rule is the repeated statement that the purpose of that rule is to deter sheriffs, policemen, and other law officers from making unlawful \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 649]\n\u00a0\n searches and seizures. The inference I gather from these repeated statements is that the rule is not a right or privilege accorded to defendants charged with crime but is a sort of punishment against officers in order to keep them from depriving people of their constitutional rights. In passing I would say that if that is the sole purpose, reason, object and effect of the rule, the Court's action in adopting it sound more like law-making than construing the Constitution. Compare Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 661\n (concurring opinion). Both the majority and the concurring members of the Boyd Court seemed to believe they were construing the Constitution. Quite aside from that aspect, however, the undoubted implication of today's opinion that the rule is not a safeguard for defendants but is a mere punishing rod to be applied to law enforcement officers is a rather startling departure from many past opinions, and even from Mapp itself. Mapp quoted from the Court's earlier opinion in Weeks v. United States, supra, certainly not with disapproval, saying that the Court \"in that case clearly stated that use of the seized evidence involved `a denial of the constitutional rights of the accused.'\" \n367 \nU.S., at 648\n. I have read and reread the Mapp opinion but have been unable to find one word in it to indicate that the exclusionary search and seizure rule should be limited on the basis that it was intended to do nothing in the world except to deter officers of the law. Certainly no such limitation is implied by the Court's statement in Mapp that without the rule:\n\n\"[T]he assurance against unreasonable . . . searches and seizures would be `a form of words,' valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties . . . .\" \n367 \nU.S., at 655\n.\n\n\n The Court went on to indicate its belief that the rule was \"`implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,'\" id., at 655, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 650]\n\u00a0\n and that it is an \"essential ingredient\" of the constitutional guarantee. Id., at 651. If the exclusionary rule has the high place in our constitutional plan of \"ordered liberty,\" which this Court in Mapp and other cases has so frequently said that it does have, what possible valid reason can justify keeping people in jail under convictions obtained by wanton disregard of a constitutional protection which the Court itself in Mapp treated as being one of the \"constitutional rights of the accused\"?\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe Court says that the exclusionary rule's purpose of preventing law enforcement officers from making lawless searches and seizures \"will not at this late date be served by the wholesale release of the guilty victims.\" Ante, p. 637. It has not been the usual thing to cut down trial protections guaranteed by the Constitution on the basis that some guilty persons might escape. There is probably no one of the rights in the Bill of Rights that does not make it more difficult to convict defendants. But all of them are based on the premise, I suppose, that the Bill of Rights' safeguards should be faithfully enforced by the courts without regard to a particular judge's judgment as to whether more people could be convicted by a refusal of courts to enforce the safeguards. Such has heretofore been accepted as a general maxim. In answer to an argument made in the Mapp case, that application of the exclusionary rule to the States might allow guilty criminals to go free, this Court conceded that:\n\n\"In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result. . . . The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence.\" Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 659. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 651]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe Court says that:\n\n\"To make the rule of Mapp retrospective would tax the administration of justice to the utmost. Hearings would have to be held on the excludability of evidence long since destroyed, misplaced or deteriorated. If it is excluded, the witnesses available at the time of the original trial will not be available or if located their memory will be dimmed. To thus legitimate such an extraordinary procedural weapon that has no bearing on guilt would seriously disrupt the administration of justice.\" Ante, pp. 637-638.\n\n\n This same argument would certainly apply with much force to many cases we have heard in the past including Reck v. Pate, supra, and Fay v. Noia, supra. Reck was directed to be given a new trial 25 years after his offense and Noia 21 years after conviction. Both were given relief under just \"such an extraordinary procedural weapon\" as the Court seems today to inveigh against. Indeed in Noia's case this Court went to great lengths to explain in an exhaustive and in what I consider to be a very notable and worthwhile opinion that habeas corpus was designed to go behind \"final\" judgments and release people who were held on convictions obtained by reason of a denial of constitutional rights. A glance at the briefs and this Court's opinions in both Reck and Noia will reveal that this Court rejected precisely the same kind of arguments and reasoning that I have just quoted from the Court's opinion justifying its judgment in this case. What the Court held in Noia did not, as the dissenting Justice charged it would, seriously disrupt the administration of justice.\n5\n It merely opened up to collateral review cases of men who were in prison due to convictions where \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 652]\n\u00a0\n their constitutional rights had been disregarded. Noia rested on the sound principle that people in jail, without regard to when they were put there, who were convicted by the use of unconstitutional evidence were entitled in a government dedicated to justice and fairness to be allowed to have a new trial with the safeguards the Constitution provides.\n\nLittle consolation can be gathered by people who languish in jail under unconstitutional convictions from the Court's statement that \"the ruptured privacy of the victims' homes and effects cannot be restored. Reparation comes too late.\" Ante, p. 637. Linkletter is still in jail. His claim is no more \"too late\" than was Noia's.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe plain facts here are that the Court's opinion cuts off many defendants who are now in jail from any hope of relief from unconstitutional convictions. The opinion today also beats a timid retreat from the wholesome and refreshing principles announced in Noia. No State should be considered to have a vested interest in keeping prisoners in jail who were convicted because of lawless conduct by the State's officials. Careful analysis of the Court's opinion shows that it rests on the premise that a State's assumed interest in sustaining convictions obtained under the old, repudiated rule outweighs the interests both of that State and of the individuals convicted \n\n[381 \nU.S. 618, 653]\n\u00a0\n in having wrongful convictions set aside. It certainly offends my sense of justice to say that a State holding in jail people who were convicted by unconstitutional methods has a vested interest in keeping them there that outweighs the right of persons adjudged guilty of crime to challenge their unconstitutional convictions at any time. No words can obscure the simple fact that the promises of Mapp and Noia are to a great extent broken by the decision here. I would reverse.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Holmes, The Common Law 5 (Howe ed. 1963).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Adkins v.

UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: March 8, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1971 (c) the Attorney General brought this action against appellants, the State of Louisiana, the three members of the State Registration Board, and the Board's Director-Secretary, charging a long-standing plan to deprive Louisiana Negroes of voting rights in violation of 1971 (a) and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The complaint alleged and the District Court held that the discriminatory scheme began with the adoption of a \"grandfather clause\" in the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, when about 44% of the State's registered voters were Negroes. Upon this Court's invalidation of a similar clause, Louisiana in 1921 substituted a new \"interpretation test,\" which required an applicant to interpret a section of the State or Federal Constitution to the satisfaction of the registrar. From that time to 1944 the proportion of registered voters who were Negroes did not exceed 1%, mainly because the white primary system kept Negroes from participating in the Democratic primary, the only politically significant election in the State. When after this Court in 1944 invalidated racial discrimination in primary elections and many registrars still failed to apply the interpretation test, the percentage of voters who were Negroes increased to 15%, a situation which, along with increased segregationist sentiment following this Court's school desegregation decision, led the legislature to create a \"Segregation Committee.\" That committee cooperated with Citizens Councils to instruct registrars to promote white political control and to begin wholesale purges of Negroes from the voting rolls. At least 21 parishes in the mid-1950's began applying the interpretation test, to which was added in 1960 a comprehension requirement, applicable to all persons, which the State Registration Board ordered rigidly enforced. The District Court, in view of the virtually unlimited discretion given voting registrars by the Louisiana laws and because the 21 parish registrars had used the interpretation test to keep Negroes from voting, held that test on its face and as applied invalid under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) and enjoined its future use in the State; with respect to the 21 parishes where the test was \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 146]\n\u00a0\n found to have been applied, it also enjoined use of a new \"citizenship\" test absent a reregistration of voters so that the new test will apply to all or none, and required monthly registration reports to be made for those parishes. Held:\n\n 1. The Attorney General has power to sue a State and its officials to protect Negroes' voting rights guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. United States v. Mississippi, ante, p. 128, followed. P. 151.\n\n\n 2. The evidence amply supported the District Court's finding that Louisiana's interpretation test, as written and applied so as to give registrars unbridled discretion without any objective standards to determine voting qualifications, was part of a successful plan unlawfully to deprive Louisiana Negroes of their voting rights.

P. 154.\n\n\n  (b) Since a large proportion of Negroes in the 21 parishes had been kept from registering by the discriminatory interpretation test, under which virtually all white applicants were allowed to register, the decree properly barred application of the new \"citizenship\" test, which the State claims is objective, absent a complete reregistration of all voters in those parishes. Pp. 154-155.\n\n\n  (c) The requirement for monthly registration reports for the 21 parishes was proper to inform the court as to whether the old discriminatory practices had been eliminated.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPursuant to authority granted in 42 U.S.C. 1971 (c) (1958 ed., Supp. V), the Attorney General brought this action on behalf of the United States in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the State of Louisiana, the three members of the State Board of Registration, and the Director-Secretary of the Board. The complaint charged that the defendants by following and enforcing unconstitutional state laws had been denying and unless restrained by the court would continue to deny Negro citizens of Louisiana the right to vote, in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) (1958 ed.)\n1\n and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case was tried and after submission of evidence,\n2\n the three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 (1958 ed.), gave judgment for the United States. 225 F. Supp. 353. The State and the other defendants appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n377 \nU.S. 987\n.\n\nThe complaint alleged, and the District Court found, that beginning with the adoption of the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, when approximately 44% of all the registered voters in the State were Negroes, the State had put into effect a successful policy of denying Negro citizens the right to vote because of their race. The 1898 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n constitution adopted what was known as a \"grandfather clause,\" which imposed burdensome requirements for registration thereafter but exempted from these future requirements any person who had been entitled to vote before January 1, 1867, or who was the son or grandson of such a person.\n3\n Such a transparent expedient for disfranchising Negroes, whose ancestors had been slaves until 1863 and not entitled to vote in Louisiana before 1867,\n4\n was held unconstitutional in 1915 as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, in a case involving a similar Oklahoma constitutional provision. Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n. Soon after that decision Louisiana, in 1921, adopted a new constitution replacing the repudiated \"grandfather clause\" with what the complaint calls an \"interpretation test,\" which required that an applicant for registration be able to \"give a reasonable interpretation\" of any clause in the Louisiana Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.\n5\n From the adoption of the 1921 interpretation test until 1944, the District Court's opinion stated, the percentage of registered voters in Louisiana who were Negroes never exceeded one percent. Prior to 1944 Negro interest in voting in Louisiana had been slight, largely because the State's white primary law kept Negroes from voting in the Democratic Party primary election, the only election that mattered in the political climate of that State. In 1944, however, this Court invalidated the substantially identical white primary law of Texas,\n6\n and with the explicit statutory bar to their voting in the primary removed and because of a generally heightened political interest, Negroes in increasing \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 149]\n\u00a0\n numbers began to register in Louisiana. The white primary system had been so effective in barring Negroes from voting that the \"interpretation test\" as a disfranchising device had been ignored over the years. Many registrars continued to ignore it after 1944, and in the next dozen years the proportion of registered voters who were Negroes rose from two-tenths of one percent to approximately 15% by March 1956. This fact, coupled with this Court's 1954 invalidation of laws requiring school segregation,\n7\n prompted the State to try new devices to keep the white citizens in control. The Louisiana Legislature created a committee which became known as the \"Segregation Committee\" to seek means of accomplishing this goal. The chairman of this committee also helped to organize a semiprivate group called the Association of Citizens Councils, which thereafter acted in close cooperation with the legislative committee to preserve white supremacy. The legislative committee and the Citizens Councils set up programs, which parish voting registrars were required to attend, to instruct the registrars on how to promote white political control. The committee and the Citizens Councils also began a wholesale challenging of Negro names already on the voting rolls, with the result that thousands of Negroes, but virtually no whites, were purged from the rolls of voters. Beginning in the middle 1950's registrars of at least 21 parishes began to apply the interpretation test. In 1960 the State Constitution was amended to require every applicant thereafter to \"be able to understand\" as well as \"give a reasonable interpretation\" of any section of the State or Federal Constitution \"when read to him by the registrar.\"\n8\n The State Board \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n of Registration in cooperation with the Segregation Committee issued orders that all parish registrars must strictly comply with the new provisions.\n\nThe interpretation test, the court found, vested in the voting registrars a virtually uncontrolled discretion as to who should vote and who should not. Under the State's statutes and constitutional provisions the registrars, without any objective standard to guide them, determine the manner in which the interpretation test is to be given, whether it is to be oral or written, the length and complexity of the sections of the State or Federal Constitution to be understood and interpreted, and what interpretation is to be considered correct. There was ample evidence to support the District Court's finding that registrars in the 21 parishes where the test was found to have been used had exercised their broad powers to deprive otherwise qualified Negro citizens of their right to vote; and that the existence of the test as a hurdle to voter qualification has in itself deterred and will continue to deter Negroes from attempting to register in Louisiana.\n\nBecause of the virtually unlimited discretion vested by the Louisiana laws in the registrars of voters, and because in the 21 parishes where the interpretation test was applied that discretion had been exercised to keep Negroes from voting because of their race, the District Court held the interpretation test invalid on its face and as applied, as a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and of 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a).\n9\n The District Court enjoined future use of the test in the State, and with respect to the 21 parishes where the invalid interpretation test was found to have \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n been applied, the District Court also enjoined use of a newly enacted \"citizenship\" test, which did not repeal the interpretation test and the validity of which was not challenged in this suit, unless a reregistration of all voters in those parishes is ordered, so that there would be no voters in those parishes who had not passed the same test.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe have held this day in United States v. Mississippi, ante, p. 128, that the Attorney General has power to bring suit against a State and its officials to protect the voting rights of Negroes guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n10\n There can be no doubt from the evidence in this case that the District Court was amply justified in finding that Louisiana's interpretation test, as written and as applied, was part of a successful plan to deprive Louisiana Negroes of their right to vote. This device for accomplishing unconstitutional discrimination has been little if any less successful than was the \"grandfather clause\" invalidated by this Court's decision in Guinn v. United States, supra, 50 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n years ago, which when that clause was adopted in 1898 had seemed to the leaders of Louisiana a much preferable way of assuring white political supremacy. The Governor of Louisiana stated in 1898 that he believed that the \"grandfather clause\" solved the problem of keeping Negroes from voting \"in a much more upright and manly fashion\"\n11\n than the method adopted previously by the States of Mississippi and South Carolina, which left the qualification of applicants to vote \"largely to the arbitrary discretion of the officers administering the law.\"\n12\n A delegate to the 1898 Louisiana Constitutional Convention also criticized an interpretation test because the \"arbitrary power, lodged with the registration officer, practically places his decision beyond the pale of judicial review; and he can enfranchise or disfranchise voters at his own sweet will and pleasure without let or hindrance.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\nBut Louisiana of a later generation did place just such arbitrary power in the hands of election officers who have used it with phenomenal success to keep Negroes from voting in the State. The State admits that the statutes and provisions of the state constitution establishing the interpretation test \"vest discretion in the registrars of voters to determine the qualifications of applicants for registration\" while imposing \"no definite and objective standards upon registrars of voters for the administration of the interpretation test.\" And the District Court found that \"Louisiana . . . provides no effective method whereby arbitrary and capricious action by registrars of voters may be prevented or redressed.\"\n14\n The applicant facing a \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n registrar in Louisiana thus has been compelled to leave his voting fate to that official's uncontrolled power to determine whether the applicant's understanding of the Federal or State Constitution is satisfactory. As the evidence showed, colored people, even some with the most advanced education and scholarship, were declared by voting registrars with less education to have an unsatisfactory understanding of the Constitution of Louisiana or of the United States. This is not a test but a trap, sufficient to stop even the most brilliant man on his way to the voting booth. The cherished right of people in a country like ours to vote cannot be obliterated by the use of laws like this, which leave the voting fate of a citizen to the passing whim or impulse of an individual registrar. Many of our cases have pointed out the invalidity of laws so completely devoid of standards and restraints. See, e. g., United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n. Squarely in point is Schnell v. Davis, \n336 \nU.S. 933\n, affirming 81 F. Supp. 872 (D.C. S. D. Ala.), in which we affirmed a district court judgment striking down as a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments an Alabama constitutional provision restricting the right to vote in that State to persons who could \"understand and explain any article of the Constitution of the United States\" to the satisfaction of voting registrars. We likewise affirm here the District Court's holding that the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and statutes which require voters to satisfy registrars of their ability to \"understand and give a reasonable interpretation of any section\" of the Federal or Louisiana Constitution violate the Constitution. And we agree with the District Court that it specifically conflicts with the prohibitions against discrimination in voting because of race found both in the Fifteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) to subject citizens to such an arbitrary power as Louisiana has given its registrars under these laws. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 154]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThis leaves for consideration the District Court's decree. We bear in mind that the court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future. Little if any objection is raised to the propriety of the injunction against further use of the interpretation test as it stood at the time this action was begun, and without further discussion we affirm that part of the decree.\n\nAppellants' chief argument against the decree concerns the effect which should be given the new voter-qualification test adopted by the Board of Registration in August 1962, pursuant to statute\n15\n and subsequent constitutional amendment\n16\n after this suit had been filed. The new test, says the State, is a uniform, objective, standardized \"citizenship\" test administered to all prospective voters alike. Under it, according to the State, an applicant is \"required to indiscriminately draw one of ten cards. Each card has six multiple choice questions, four of which the applicant must answer correctly.\" Confining itself to the allegations of the complaint, the District Court did not pass upon the validity of the new test, but did take it into consideration in formulating the decree.\n17\n The court found that past discrimination against Negro \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 155]\n\u00a0\n applicants in the 21 parishes where the interpretation test had been applied had greatly reduced the proportion of potential Negro voters who were registered as compared with the proportion of whites. Most if not all of those white voters had been permitted to register on far less rigorous terms than colored applicants whose applications were rejected. Since the new \"citizenship\" test does not provide for a reregistration of voters already accepted by the registrars, it would affect only applicants not already registered, and would not disturb the eligibility of the white voters who had been allowed to register while discriminatory practices kept Negroes from doing so. In these 21 parishes, while the registration of white persons was increasing, the number of Negroes registered decreased from 25,361 to 10,351. Under these circumstances we think that the court was quite right to decree that, as to persons who met age and residence requirements during the years in which the interpretation test was used, use of the new \"citizenship\" test should be postponed in those 21 parishes where registrars used the old interpretation test until those parishes have ordered a complete reregistration of voters, so that the new test will apply alike to all or to none. Cf. United States v. Duke, 332 F.2d 759, 769-770 (C. A. 5th Cir.).\n\nIt also was certainly an appropriate exercise of the District Court's discretion to order reports to be made every month concerning the registration of voters in these 21 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 145, 156]\n\u00a0\n parishes, in order that the court might be informed as to whether the old discriminatory practices really had been abandoned in good faith. The need to eradicate past evil effects and to prevent the continuation or repetition in the future of the discriminatory practices shown to be so deeply engrained in the laws, policies, and traditions of the State of Louisiana, completely justified the District Court in entering the decree it did and in retaining jurisdiction of the entire case to hear any evidence of discrimination in other parishes and to enter such orders as justice from time to time might require.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN considers that the constitutional conclusions reached in this opinion can properly be based only on the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment.

TEXAS(1965)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: November 22, 1965\n\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS is of the opinion that certiorari should be granted. Memorandum of Mr. Chief Justice WARREN:   Each of these three cases stems from the following factual setting:   The Grand Jury of Harris County, Texas, was impaneled on May 7, 1962, to investigate irregularities in the administration of the Probate Court. While Grand Jury sessions were proceeding, the District Attorney of the County, in cooperation with the Justice of the Peace, took the virtually unprecedented step of obtaining an order to institute a 'Court of Inquiry.'   This body, formerly sanctioned by Vernon's Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, arts. 886, 887, permits a justice of the peace to summon and examine witnesses and take sworn testimony. Those who fail to comply with his summons or refuse to make statements under oath may be fined and imprisoned. From the year of its enactment-1876-to this date, it appears that the procedure had been seldom invoked.   The secret Grand Jury deliberations were postponed while the District Attorney pursued the Court of Inquiry publicly, in front of the press, radio recorders and television cameras. In this inflamed atmosphere, the petitioners were questioned for some four days, although they objected to testifying. They were not permitted to consult with their attorneys during the proceedings, to de- \n\n[382 \nU.S. 928\n, 929]\n\u00a0\n fend themselves, to cross-examine or confront the witnesses against them, to call witnesses on their behalf, to rebut or to contradict the evidence produced by the prosecution. Two days later, the Grand Jury was reconvened and brought in indictments against the petitioners.\n  Due to a change of venue and continuances secured by the petitioners, their trials did not take place until more than two years later in a neighboring county. Their pretrial motions to quash the indictments were denied, in two cases without hearings, and they were found guilty of the offenses charged.\n  The Texas Legislature has since repealed the 'Court of Inquiry' proceeding through the adoption of a new Code of Criminal Procedure, Laws 1965, 59th Leg.Reg.Sess., c. 722, to become effective January 1, 1966. Under the new Code, no justice of the peace may convene a Court of Inquiry. Rather, they may be conducted only by district judges, and all witnesses and entitled to the same protections as in felony prosecutions. Arts. 52. 01-.06.\n  It is clear that grave constitutional questions are raised by conducting such a proceeding. See, e. g., Estes v. State of Texas, \n381 \nU.S. 532\n; Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 90\n-91, 266. Against the background of the factors mentioned above, the Court has declined review. Our denial of the petitions for certiorari in these cases should not be taken in any way as sanctioning the proceedings or of approving of the judgments below. It means only that 'for one reason or another these cases did not commend themselves to at least four members of the Court as falling within those considerations which should lead this Court to exercise its discretion in reviewing a lower court's decision.'

The only survivor was the jet trainer pilot, whose negligence is not disputed. The pilot held a commission from the Governor of Maryland as an officer in the Maryland Air National Guard where he served on alternate Saturdays as a fighter pilot and Squadron Maintenance Officer. He was otherwise employed by the Guard as a civilian Aircraft Maintenance Chief under 32 U.S.C. 709, as a so-called \"caretaker\" of Guard property. This suit was brought against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The principal issue below was whether the pilot was in his military or civilian capacity at the time of the accident. The District Court found he was in a civilian status and awarded judgment for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: In both his civilian and military capacities the pilot was an employee of the State of Maryland and thus the United States is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for his negligence in either capacity. Pp. 46-53.\n\n (a) Except when called into federal service, the Guard is in charge of the Governor of the State and its military members are state employees.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question we decide here is whether a civilian employee and military member of the National Guard is an \"employee\" of the United States for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act when his National Guard unit is not in active federal service.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioners' decedents were passengers on a Capital Airlines plane that collided over Maryland with a jet trainer assigned to the Maryland Air National Guard. The only survivor of the accident was the pilot of the trainer, Captain McCoy, and it is not disputed that the collision was caused by his negligence. The estates of the pilot and co-pilot of the Capital plane, and Capital Airlines itself, filed suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act in the District Court for the District of Columbia, and recovered judgments. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. United States v. Maryland for the use of Meyer, 116 U.S. App. D.C. 259, 322 F.2d 1009, cert. denied, \n375 \nU.S. 954\n, motion for leave to file petition for rehearing pending, No. 543, 1963 Term. Meanwhile, petitioners filed a similar suit in the Western District of Pennsylvania, and all parties agreed to proceed solely on the record made in the Meyer case. The District Court rendered judgment for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 329 F.2d 722. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 877\n, to resolve the conflict between the two Circuits on this single record, and, more broadly, to settle authoritatively the basic question stated at the outset of this opinion which is at the core of other litigation arising out of this same disaster, now pending in a number of courts in different parts of the country.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCaptain McCoy held a commission from the Governor of Maryland as an officer in the Maryland Air National Guard, and he served on alternate Saturdays as a fighter pilot and Squadron Maintenance Officer with the 104th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. During the rest of the month Captain McCoy was employed by the Guard in a civilian capacity as Aircraft Maintenance Chief under 32 U.S.C. 709 (1958 ed.), the so-called federal \"caretaker\" statute.\n3\n In his civilian capacity Captain McCoy \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n supervised the maintenance of the squadron aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard but owned by the United States. On the day of the accident, Captain McCoy had obtained permission from his superior to take a passenger on a flight in order to interest the passenger in joining the Air National Guard. The principal factual dispute below was whether at the time of the accident Captain McCoy was performing his duties with the Guard in a military or civilian capacity. A line of cases in the courts of appeals beginning with United States v. Holly, 192 F.2d 221 (C. A. 10th Cir., 1951), has held that civilian \"caretakers\" are employees of the United States for purposes of suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n4\n Another line of cases has been equally consistent in treating military members of the Guard as employees of the States, not the Federal Government.\n5\n We do not deal with the factual question, on which the decision below turned.\n6\n since, in agreement with the views \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n of Judge Smith\n7\n and in disagreement with the Court of Appeals in the Meyer case, we hold that in both capacities Captain McCoy was an employee of the State of Maryland, and not of the United States. Hence the United States cannot be held liable under the Tort Claims Act for his negligence in either capacity.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution.\n8\n It has only been in recent years that the National Guard has been an organized force, capable of being assimilated with ease into the regular military establishment of the United States. From the days of the Minutemen of Lexington and Concord until just before World War I, the various militias embodied the concept of a citizen army, but lacked the equipment and training necessary for their use as an integral part of the reserve force of the United States Armed Forces.\n9\n The passage of the National Defense Act of 1916\n10\n materially altered the status of the militias by constituting them as the National Guard. Pursuant to power vested in Congress by the Constitution (see n. 8), the Guard was to be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n uniformed, equipped, and trained in much the same way as the regular army, subject to federal standards and capable of being \"federalized\" by units, rather than by drafting individual soldiers.\n11\n In return, Congress authorized the allocation of federal equipment to the Guard, and provided federal compensation for members of the Guard, supplementing any state emoluments. The Governor, however, remained in charge of the National Guard in each State except when the Guard was called into active federal service; in most instances the Governor administered the Guard through the State Adjutant General,\n12\n who was required by the Act to report periodically to the National Guard Bureau, a federal organization, on the Guard's reserve status.\n13\n The basic structure of the 1916 Act has been preserved to the present day.\n\nSection 90 of the National Defense Act authorized the payment of federal funds for the employment by the Guard of civilian \"caretakers\" to be responsible for the upkeep of federal equipment allocated to the National Guard.\n14\n This section was later amended to make explicit that employment as a caretaker could be held by officers in the Guard, who would receive a full-time salary \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n as civilian caretakers, and in addition would receive compensation for service as military members of the Guard.\n15\n The legislative history of these amendments makes clear that the State Adjutant General could appoint officers of the Guard to serve as civilian caretakers, provided only that the appointees met the requirements established by the federal authorities.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIt is not argued here that military members of the Guard are federal employees, even though they are paid with federal funds and must conform to strict federal requirements in order to satisfy training and promotion standards. Their appointment by state authorities and the immediate control exercised over them by the States make it apparent that military members of the Guard are employees of the States, and so the courts of appeals have uniformly held. See n. 5. supra. Civilian caretakers should not be considered as occupying a different status. Caretakers, like military members of the Guard, are also paid with federal funds and must observe federal requirements in order to maintain their positions.\n17\n Although they are employed to maintain federal property, it is property for which the States are responsible, and its maintenance is for the purpose of keeping the state militia in a ready status. The National Defense Act of 1916 authorized the allocation of federal property to the National Guard, but provided\n\n\"That as a condition precedent to the issue of any property as provided for by this Act, the State, Territory, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 49]\n\u00a0\n or the District of Columbia desiring such issue shall make adequate provision, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of War, for the protection and care of such property . . . .\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Act also provided that damage or loss of federal property would be charged to the States, unless the Secretary of War determined that the damage or loss was unavoidable.\n19\n Caretakers appointed under 90 of the Act were thus to perform a state function, the maintenance of federal equipment allocated to the Guard.\n20\n The caretakers have been termed the \"backbone\" of the Guard,\n21\n and are the only personnel on duty with Guard units during the greater part of the year. Like their military counterpart, caretakers are appointed by the State Adjutant General,\n22\n and are responsible to him in the performance of their daily duties. They can be discharged and promoted only by him.\n23\n Civilian caretakers are treated as state employees for purposes of the Social Security Act,\n24\n for state retirement funds,\n25\n and under the regulations \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 50]\n\u00a0\n issued by the Department of the Air Force.\n26\n As early as 1920 the Comptroller of the Treasury ruled that a civilian caretaker was not a federal employee entitled to the annual leave provisions applicable to the War Department,\n27\n an opinion that was reiterated in 1941 by the Comptroller General\n28\n and that reflects the consistent position of the Department of Defense.\n29\n\u00a0\n\nUnited States v. Holly, supra, decided in 1951, held that civilian caretakers were employees of the United States, and has since been followed in other courts of appeals (n. 4, supra). Holly rested on a construction of the National Defense Act which, in our view, is not supported by the legislative history. Although the original section provided that caretakers were to \"be detailed by the battery or troop commander\" (who was a state employee), n. 14, supra, in 1935 Congress amended the statute to provide that the Secretary of the military establishment concerned (here the Secretary of the Air Force) \"shall designate the person to employ\" the caretaker.\n30\n The court in Holly read this amendment to mean that caretakers could be employed directly by federal authorities or by the State Adjutant General acting as a federal agent. However, the purpose of the amendment was simply to permit a State to pool its caretakers, and not to restrict the employment of such personnel only to those on the military roster of the unit where the equipment was allotted. The Senate report indicates that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 51]\n\u00a0\n Congress envisaged that caretakers would continue to be employed only by the state authorities. It stated:\n\n \"Section 6 of S. 2710 will authorize the pooling of National Guard caretakers. Under present law States are required to select the caretakers from the units that have the material. Section 6 will permit the handling under the adjutant general or other proper State official of the caretakers as a pool.\"\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n It seems clear, then, that no significant distinction was intended between the method of employing military and civilian personnel of the National Guard.\n\nCongress again in 1954 accepted the Defense Department understanding that civilian caretakers were employees of the States. In amending the Social Security Act (68 Stat. 1059, 42 U.S.C. 418 (b) (5) (1958 ed.)) to provide coverage for civilian caretakers as state employees, the committee reports stated:\n\n\"This provision would establish as a separate coverage group civilian employees of State National Guard units who are employed pursuant to section 90 of the National Defense Act . . . and paid from funds allotted to such units by the Department of Defense. These employees would also be deemed to be employees of the State. The Department of Defense does not regard these employees as Federal employees . . . .\"\n32\n\u00a0\n\n\n In 1956 Congress authorized federal disbursing officers to withhold from the salaries of civilian caretakers amounts needed by the States for their retirement systems. Although Congress was aware of the Holly line of cases,\n33\n the Senate report stated that authority was \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n necessary since \"[t]hese employees, although paid from Federal funds, are considered to be State rather than Federal employees. Accordingly, State authorities have been unable to make the usual deduction of the employee's contribution into the retirement system.\" S. Rep. No. 2045, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (1956).\n\nIn 1960 it was proposed to extend the coverage of the Federal Tort Claims Act to include civilian and military personnel of the National Guard.\n34\n This proposal was rejected, and the bill that finally passed provides an administrative procedure whereby the proper Secretary can pay claims up to $5,000 for damage to persons or property caused by National Guard personnel.\n35\n The Act includes liability for personal injury caused by civilian caretakers, even though the Justice Department called to the attention of Congress the line of cases indicating that acts of civilian caretakers were already covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n36\n The committee reports of both the House and Senate reflect acceptance of the position advocated by the Department of the Army that civilian caretakers should be included in the bill along with their military counterparts.\n37\n\u00a0\n\nIn sum, we conclude that the congressional purpose in authorizing the employment by state authorities of civilian caretakers, the administrative practice of the Defense Department in treating caretakers as state employees, the consistent congressional recognition of that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 53]\n\u00a0\n status, and the like supervision exercised by the States over both military and civilian personnel of the National Guard, unmistakably lead in combination to the view that civilian as well as military personnel of the Guard are to be treated for the purposes of the Tort Claims Act as employees of the States and not of the Federal Government. This requires a decision that the United States is not liable to petitioners for the negligent conduct of McCoy.\n38\n\u00a0\n\nIn so holding we are not unmindful that this doubtless leaves those who suffered from this accident without effective legal redress for their losses.\n39\n It is nevertheless our duty to take the law as we find it, remitting those aggrieved to whatever requirement may be deemed appropriate by Congress. which in affording the administrative remedies, unfortunately not available here (see n. 37), has shown itself not impervious to the moral demands of such distressing situations.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Federal Tort Claims Act provides in pertinent part:\n\n28 U.S.C. 1346 (1958 ed.):\n\n\"(b) Subject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this title, the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"\n\n\n 28 U.S.C. 2671:\n\n\"As used in this chapter and sections 1346 (b) and 2401 (b) of this title, the term -\n\n\n\"`Federal agency' includes the executive departments and independent establishment of the United States, and corporations primarily acting as, instrumentalities or agencies of the United States but does not include any contractor with the United States.\n\n\n\"`Employee of the government' includes officers or employees of any federal agency, members of the military or naval forces of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n United States, and persons acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity, temporarily or permanently in the service of the United States, whether with or without compensation.\"\n\n\n 28 U.S.C. 2674:\n\n\"The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We are informed that such litigation is pending in Illinois, Ohio, and New York.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] National Defense Act of 1916, 90, 39 Stat. 166, as amended, now 32 U.S.C. 709 (1958 ed.):\n\n\"(a) Under such regulations as the Secretary of the Army may prescribe, funds allotted by him for the Army National Guard may be spent for the compensation of competent persons to care for material, armament, and equipment of the Army National Guard.

JEWEL TEA(1965)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent brought this action under 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act against petitioners, seven local unions, Associated Food Retailers of Greater Chicago, Inc. (Associated), an association of retail food stores, and Associated's secretary and treasurer, alleging that petitioners and Associated had conspired to restrain competition in retail meat markets in the Chicago area by limiting the marketing hours for the sale of fresh meat through a clause in the collective bargaining agreement between Associated and petitioners and between respondent and petitioners. The District Court, after trial, held that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding of a conspiracy to force the restrictive provision on respondent, that the marketing-hours limitation was imposed by the unions to serve their own interests respecting conditions of employment, and that such action was clearly within the labor exemption of the Sherman Act. The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the complaint as to the unions and Associated, and without upsetting the District Court's finding that, apart from the contractual provision itself, there was no evidence of conspiracy, concluded that a conspiracy in restraint of trade was shown. It held that the employer-union contract concerning working hours is unlawful, as the establishment of the hours of work is a function of the employer. Held: The judgment is reversed. Pp. 679-735.\n\n 331 F.2d 547, reversed.\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concluded that:\n\n 1. This controversy involving whether a proposed bargaining subject is a term or condition of employment is not within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. Pp. 684-688.\n\n\n  (a) Courts have had experience in classifying bargaining subjects as terms or conditions of employment, as under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. P. 686. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 677]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (b) The primary jurisdiction doctrine does not require resort to an administrative proceeding when the case must eventually be decided on a controlling legal issue unrelated to the administrative determination. P. 686.\n\n\n  (c) There is no procedure available in this case for obtaining a determination by the Labor Board. P. 687.\n\n\n 2. Exemption of union-employer agreements from the coverage of the Sherman Act is a matter of accommodating that Act to the policy of the labor laws, as this Court pointed out in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, ante, p. 657, and the fact that employers and unions are required to bargain about wages, hours and working conditions weighs heavily in favor of antitrust exemption for agreement on these subjects. P. 689.\n\n\n 3. A provision establishing the particular hours of work would be within the ambit of wages, hours and working conditions requiring mandatory bargaining, and the unions' success in obtaining that provision through negotiation in pursuit of their own policies falls within the protection of the national labor policy and is exempt from the Sherman Act. Pp. 689-691.\n\n\n 4. Likewise a marketing-hours restriction would be exempt if night operation of meat markets would require night employment of butchers, impair the butchers' jurisdiction or substantially affect their workload. P. 692.\n\n\n 5. But if self-service markets could conduct night operations without affecting the vital interests of butchers, there might be restraint on the product market, and the limitation imposed by the unions might be nothing more than an attempt to protect one group of employers from competition from another group, which is conduct not exempt from the Sherman Act. Pp. 692-693.\n\n\n 6. The resolution by the District Court of the question of whether night operations without butchers, and without infringement of the butchers' interests, are feasible, in favor of the unions' position, was supported by evidence in the record and is not clearly erroneous. Pp. 694-697.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE GOLDBERG, joined by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concluded that:\n\n The history of legislative enactments in the area of collective bargaining demonstrates a consistent congressional purpose to limit severely judicial intervention into the formulation of labor policy through the use of the antitrust laws. Congress intended to foreclose judges and juries from making essentially economic judgments \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 678]\n\u00a0\n in antitrust cases by determining whether unions or employers has good or bad motives for their agreements on mandatory subjects of collective bargaining. Pp. 697-735.\n\n\n (a) Where Congress deemed there were specific abuses on the part of labor unions it enacted specific proscriptions in the labor statutes. Pp. 707-708.\n\n\n (b) The Court should follow the approach of United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n, that the labor exemption from the antitrust laws derives from a synthesis of all pertinent legislation, and hold that collective bargaining activity concerning mandatory subjects of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act is not subject to the antitrust laws. Pp. 709-710.\n\n\n (c) Multi-employer bargaining is not illegal or opposed to the national labor policy. Pp. 712-713.\n\n\n (d) Labor contracts establishing standardized wages, hours or other conditions of employment are often secured by bargaining with multi-employer associations or through bargaining with market leaders that sets a \"pattern,\" and the policy of pattern bargaining should not lead to antitrust liability merely because of its form. P. 722.\n\n\n (e) In this case even if the self-service markets could operate after 6 p. m., without their butchers and without increasing the work of their butchers at other times, the result of such operation can reasonably be expected to be either that the small, independent service markets would have to remain open in order to compete, thus requiring their union butchers to work at night, or that the small, independent service markets would not be able to operate at night and thus be put at a competitive disadvantage. Pp. 727-728.\n\n\n (f) Since it is clear that the large, automated self-service markets employ fewer butchers per volume of sales than service markets do, the Union has a legitimate interest in keeping service markets competitive so as to preserve jobs. P. 728.\n\n\n (g) The direct interest of the Union in not working undesirable hours by curtailing all business at those hours is a far cry from the indirect interest of a union in fixing prices and allocating markets solely to increase the profits of favored employers. Pp. 728-729.\n\n\n (h) If unions are held liable under the antitrust laws for activities concerning mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, then the employer parties to such bargaining would also be subject to antitrust penalties, which would be clearly contrary to congressional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 679]\n\u00a0\n policy and manifestly unfair in view of their statutory duty to bargain. Pp. 729-730.\n\n\n Bernard Dunau argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Lester Asher, Leo Segall and Robert C. Eardley.\n\nGeorge B. Christensen argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Fred H. Daugherty, Theodore A. Groenke and Samuel Weisbard.\n\nSolicitor General Cox, by special leave of Court, argued the cause for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.

Avery for the National Independent Meat Packers Association, and by Allen Whitfield for the National Livestock Feeders Association et al.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join.\n\nLike No. 48, United Mine Workers v. Pennington, decided today, ante, p. 657, this case presents questions regarding the application of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2 (1958 ed.), to activities of labor unions. In particular, it concerns the lawfulness of the following restriction on the operating hours of food store meat departments contained in a collective bargaining agreement executed after joint multi-employer, multi-union negotiations:\n\n \"Market operating hours shall be 9:00 a. m. to 6:00  p. m. Monday through Saturday, inclusive. No customer \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 680]\n\u00a0\n  shall be served who comes into the market  before or after the hours set forth above.\"\n\n\n This litigation arose out of the 1957 contract negotiations between the representatives of 9,000 Chicago retailers of fresh meat and the seven union petitioners, who are local affiliates of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America, AFL-CIO, representing virtually all butchers in the Chicago area. During the 1957 bargaining sessions the employer group presented several requests for union consent to a relaxation of the existing contract restriction on marketing hours for fresh meat, which forbade the sale of meat before 9 a. m. and after 6 p. m. in both service and self-service markets.\n1\n The unions rejected all such suggestions, and their own proposal retaining the marketing-hours restriction was ultimately accepted at the final bargaining session by all but two of the employers, National Tea Co. and Jewel Tea Co. (hereinafter \"Jewel\"). Associated Food Retailers of Greater Chicago, a trade association having about 1,000 individual and independent merchants as members and representing some 300 meat dealers in the negotiations, was among those who accepted. Jewel, however, asked the union negotiators to present to their membership, on behalf of it and National Tea, a counteroffer that included provision for Friday night operations. At the same time Jewel voiced its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 681]\n\u00a0\n belief, as it had midway through the negotiations that any marketing-hours restriction was illegal. On the recommendation of the union negotiators, the Jewel offer was rejected by the union membership, and a strike was authorized. Under the duress of the strike vote, Jewel decided to sign the contract previously approved by the rest of the industry.\n\nIn July 1958 Jewel brought suit against the unions, certain of their officers, Associated, and Charles H. Bromann, Secretary-Treasurer of Associated, seeking invalidation under 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act of the contract provision that prohibited night meat market operations. The gist of the complaint was that the defendants and others had conspired together to prevent the retail sale of fresh meat before 9 a. m. and after 6 p. m. As evidence of the conspiracy Jewel relied in part on the events during the 1957 contract negotiations - the acceptance by Associated of the market-hours restriction and the unions' imposition of the restriction on Jewel through a strike threat. Jewel also alleged that it was a part of the conspiracy that the unions would neither permit their members to work at times other than the hours specified nor allow any grocery firm to sell meat, with or without employment of their members, outside those hours; that the members of Associated, which had joined only one of the 1957 employer proposals for extended marketing hours, had agreed among themselves to insist on the inclusion of the marketing-hours limitation in all collective bargaining agreements between the unions and any food store operator; that Associated, its members and officers had agreed with the other defendants that no firm was to be permitted to operate self-service meat markets between 6 p. m. and 9 p. m.; and that the unions, their officers and members had acted as the enforcing agent of the conspiracy. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 682]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe complaint stated that in recent years the prepackaged, self-service system of marketing meat had come into vogue, that 174 of Jewel's 196 stores were equipped to vend meat in this manner, and that a butcher need not be on duty in a self-service market at the time meat purchases were actually made. The prohibition of night meat marketing, it was alleged, unlawfully impeded Jewel in the use of its property and adversely affected the general public in that many persons find it inconvenient to shop during the day. An injunction, treble damages and attorneys' fees were demanded.\n\nThe trial judge held the allegations of the complaint sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss made on the grounds, inter alia, that (a) the alleged restraint was within the exclusive regulatory scope of the National Labor Relations Act and was therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Court and (b) the controversy was within the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. That ruling was sustained on appeal. Jewel Tea Co. v. Local Unions Nos. 189, etc., Amalgamated Meat Cutters, AFL-CIO, 274 F.2d 217 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, \n362 \nU.S. 936\n. After trial, however, the District Judge ruled the \"record was devoid of any evidence to support a finding of conspiracy\" between Associated and the unions to force the restrictive provision on Jewel. 215 F. Supp. 839, 845. Testing the unions' action standing alone, the trial court found that even in self-service markets removal of the limitation on marketing hours either would inaugurate longer hours and night work for the butchers or would result in butchers' work being done by others unskilled in the trade. Thus, the court concluded, the unions had imposed the marketing-hours limitation to serve their own interests respecting conditions of employment, and such action was clearly within the labor exemption of the Sherman Act established by Hunt v. Crumboch, \n325 \nU.S. 821\n; United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n; United States \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 683]\n\u00a0\n v. American Federation of Musicians, \n318 \nU.S. 741\n. Alternately, the District Court ruled that even if this was not the case, the arrangement did not amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the complaint as to both the unions and Associated. Without disturbing the District Court's finding that, apart from the contractual provision itself, there was no evidence of conspiracy, the Court of Appeals concluded that a conspiracy in restraint of trade had been shown. The court noted that \"[t]he rest of the Industry agreed with the Defendant Local Unions to continue the ban on night operations,\" while plaintiff resisted, and concluded that Associated and the unions \"entered into a combination or agreement, which constituted a conspiracy, as charged in the complaint. . . [w]hether it be called an agreement, a contract or a conspiracy, is immaterial.\" 331 F.2d 547, 551.\n\nSimilarly, the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to review the lower court's finding that night marketing would affect either the butchers' working hours or their jurisdiction, for the court held that an employer-union contract respecting working hours would be unlawful. \"One of the proprietary functions is the determination of what days a week and what hours of the day the business will be open to supply its customers. . . . As long as all rights of employees are recognized and duly observed by the employer, including the number of hours per day that any one shall be required to work, any agreement by a labor union, acting in concert with business competitors of the employer, designed to interfere with his operation of a retail business . . . is a violation of the Sherman Act . . . . [T]he furnishing of a place and advantageous hours of employment for the butchers to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 684]\n\u00a0\n supply meat to customers are the prerogatives of the employer.\" 331 F.2d 547, 549.\n\nWe granted certiorari on the unions' petition,\n2\n\u00a0\n379 \nU.S. 813\n,\n3\n and now reverse the Court of Appeals.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWe must first consider the unions' attack on the appropriateness of the District Court's exercise of jurisdiction, which is encompassed in their contention that this controversy is within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. On this point, which is distinct from the unions' argument that the operating-hours restriction is subject to regulation only by the Board and is thus wholly exempt from the antitrust laws, the unions' thesis is that the pivotal issue is whether the operating-hours restriction is a \"term or condition of employment\" and that the District Court should have held the case on its docket pending a Board proceeding to resolve that issue, which is said to be peculiarly within the competence of the Board.\n\n\"The doctrine of primary jurisdiction . . . applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 685]\n\u00a0\n into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\" United States v. Western Pac. R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59, 63\n-64. The doctrine is based on the principle \"that in cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over,\" Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570, 574\n, and \"requires judicial abstention in cases where protection of the integrity of a regulatory scheme dictates preliminary resort to the agency which administers the scheme,\" United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, \n374 \nU.S. 321, 353\n.\n\n\n Whether a proposed bargaining subject is a term or condition of employment is an issue that the Board frequently determines in considering charges that an employer or union has violated the duty to bargain in good faith concerning \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment,\" the mandatory subjects of bargaining described in 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended. Such an issue may be raised by an unfair labor practice charge of violation of 8 (a) (5) or 8 (b) (3) through, for example, a refusal to bargain on a mandatory subject of bargaining, see Labor Board v. Katz, \n369 \nU.S. 736\n, or insistence on a nonmandatory subject, see Labor Board v. Borg-Warner Corp., \n356 \nU.S. 342\n. Thus, the unions contend, Jewel could have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board on the ground that the unions had insisted on a nonmandatory subject - the marketing-hours restriction. Obviously, classification of bargaining subjects as \"terms \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 686]\n\u00a0\n or conditions of employment\" is a matter concerning which the Board has special expertise. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated below we cannot conclude that this is a proper case for application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\n\nTo begin with, courts are themselves not without experience in classifying bargaining subjects as terms or conditions of employment. Just such a determination must be frequently made when a court's jurisdiction to issue an injunction affecting a labor dispute is challenged under the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which defines \"labor dispute\" as including \"any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment,\" Norris-LaGuardia Act, 13 (c), 47 Stat. 73, 29 U.S.C. 113 (c) (1958 ed.). See Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., \n362 \nU.S. 330\n; Bakery Drivers Union v. Wagshal, \n333 \nU.S. 437\n; cf. Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n.\n\nSecondly, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is not a doctrine of futility; it does not require resort to \"an expensive and merely delaying administrative proceeding when the case must eventually be decided on a controlling legal issue wholly unrelated to determinations for the ascertainment of which the proceeding was sent to the agency.\" Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., \n356 \nU.S. 481, 521\n (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). It was only after commencement of trial that it became evident that a major issue in this case would be whether the marketing-hours restriction was a term or condition of employment. Jewel's complaint alleged the existence of a conspiracy between Associated and the unions to impose the marketing-hours provision on Jewel - that is, it was alleged that the unions had agreed with a part of the bargaining unit to impose certain terms on the rest of the unit. We hold today in United Mine Workers v. Pennington with respect to allegations of a similar employer-union agreement to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 687]\n\u00a0\n impose a particular scale of wages - indisputably at the core of \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\" - that such an understanding is not exempt from the Sherman Act. At the stage when the decision whether to refer the parties to the Board was made, therefore, the issues were so framed that a Board determination would have been of subsidiary importance at best.\n\nFinally, we must reject the unions' primary-jurisdiction contention because of the absence of an available procedure for obtaining a Board determination. The Board does not classify bargaining subjects in the abstract but only in connection with unfair labor practice charges of refusal to bargain. The typical antitrust suit, however, is brought by a stranger to the bargaining relationship, and the complaint is not that the parties have refused to bargain but, quite the contrary, that they have agreed. Jewel's conspiracy allegation in the present case was just such a complaint. Agreement is of course not a refusal to bargain, and in such cases the Board affords no mechanism for obtaining a classification of the subject matter of the agreement. Moreover, even in the few instances when the antitrust action could be framed as a refusal to bargain charge, there is no guarantee of Board action. It is the function of the Board's General Counsel rather than the Board or a private litigant to determine whether an unfair labor practice complaint will ultimately issue. National Labor Relations Act, 3 (d), 29 U.S.C. 153 (d) (1958 ed.). And the six-month limitation period of 10 (b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 160 (b) (1958 ed.). would preclude many litigants from even filing a charge with the General Counsel. Indeed, Jewel's complaint in this very case was filed more than six months after it signed the 1957 collective bargaining agreement. \"[W]e know of no case where the court has ordered reference of an issue which the administrative body would not itself \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 688]\n\u00a0\n have jurisdiction to determine in a proceeding for that purpose.\" Montana Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246, 254\n.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\nHere, as in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, ante, p. 657, the claim is made that the agreement under attack is exempt from the antitrust laws. We agree, but not on the broad grounds urged by the union.\n\nIt is well at the outset to emphasize that this case comes to us stripped of any claim of a union-employer conspiracy against Jewel. The trial court found no evidence to sustain Jewel's conspiracy claim and this finding was not disturbed by the Court of Appeals. We therefore have a situation where the unions, having obtained a marketing-hours agreement from one group of employers, have successfully sought the same terms from a single employer, Jewel, not as a result of a bargain between the unions and some employers directed against other employers, but pursuant to what the unions deemed to be in their own labor union interests.\n\nJewel does not allege that it has been injured by the elimination of competition among the other employers within the unit with respect to marketing hours; Jewel complains only of the unions' action in forcing it to accept the same restriction, the unions acting not at the behest of any employer group but in pursuit of their own policies. It might be argued that absent any union-employer conspiracy against Jewel and absent any agreement between Jewel and any other employer, the union-Jewel contract cannot be a violation of the Sherman Act. But the issue \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 689]\n\u00a0\n before us is not the broad substantive one of a violation of the antitrust laws - was there a conspiracy or combination which unreasonably restrained trade or an attempt to monopolize and was Jewel damaged in its business? - but whether the agreement is immune from attack by reason of the labor exemption from the antitrust laws. See note 3, supra. The fact that the parties to the agreement are but a single employer and the unions representing its employees does not compel immunity for the agreement. We must consider the subject matter of the agreement in the light of the national labor policy. Cf. Bakery Drivers Union v. Wagshal, \n333 \nU.S. 437\n.\n\nWe pointed out in Pennington that exemption for union-employer agreements is very much a matter of accommodating the coverage of the Sherman Act to the policy of the labor laws. Employers and unions are required to bargain about wages, hours and working conditions, and this fact weighs heavily in favor of antitrust exemption for agreements on these subjects. But neither party need bargain about other matters and either party commits an unfair labor practice if it conditions its bargaining upon discussions of a nonmandatory subject. Labor Board v. Borg-Warner Corp., \n356 \nU.S. 342\n. Jewel, for example, need not have bargained about or agreed to a schedule of prices at which its meat would be sold and the unions could not legally have insisted that it do so. But if the unions had made such a demand, Jewel had agreed and the United States or an injured party had challenged the agreement under the antitrust laws, we seriously doubt that either the unions or Jewel could claim immunity by reason of the labor exemption, whatever substantive questions of violation there might be.\n\nThus the issue in this case is whether the marketing-hours restriction, like wages, and unlike prices, is so intimately related to wages, hours and working conditions that the unions' successful attempt to obtain that provision \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 690]\n\u00a0\n through bona fide, arm's-length bargaining in pursuit of their own labor union policies, and not at the behest of or in combination with nonlabor groups, falls within the protection of the national labor policy and is therefore exempt from the Sherman Act.\n5\n We think that it is.\n\nThe Court of Appeals would classify the marketing-hours restriction with the product-pricing provision and place both within the reach of the Sherman Act. In its view, labor has a legitimate interest in the number of hours it must work but no interest in whether the hours fall in the daytime, in the nighttime or on Sundays. \"[T]he furnishing of a place and advantageous hours of employment for the butchers to supply meat to customers are the prerogatives of the employer.\" 331 F.2d 547, 549. That reasoning would invalidate with respect to both service and self-service markets the 1957 provision that \"eight hours shall constitute the basic work day. Monday through Saturday; work to begin at 9:00 a. m. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 691]\n\u00a0\n and stop at 6:00 p. m. . . .\" as well as the marketing-hours restriction.\n\nContrary to the Court of Appeals, we think that the particular hours of the day and the particular days of the week during which employees shall be required to work are subjects well within the realm of \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\" about which employers and unions must bargain. National Labor Relations Act, 8 (d); see Timken Roller Bearing Co., 70 N. L. R. B. 500, 504, 515-516, 521 (1946), rev'd on other grounds, 161 F.2d 949 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1947) (employer's unilateral imposition of Sunday work was refusal to bargain); Massey Gin & Machine Works, Inc., 78 N. L. R. B. 189, 195, 199 (1948) (change in starting and quitting time); Camp & McInnes, Inc., 100 N. L. R. B. 524, 532 (1952) (reduction of lunch hour and advancement of quitting time). And, although the effect on competition is apparent and real, perhaps more so than in the case of the wage agreement, the concern of union members is immediate and direct. Weighing the respective interests involved, we think the national labor policy expressed in the National Labor Relations Act places beyond the reach of the Sherman Act union-employer agreements on when, as well as how long, employees must work. An agreement on these subjects between the union and the employers in a bargaining unit is not illegal under the Sherman Act, nor is the union's unilateral demand for the same contract of other employers in the industry.\n\nDisposing of the case, as it did, on the broad grounds we have indicated, the Court of Appeals did not deal separately with the marketing-hours provision, as distinguished from hours of work, in connection with either service or self-service markets. The dispute here pertains principally to self-service markets. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 692]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe unions argue that since night operations would be impossible without night employment of butchers, or an impairment of the butchers' jurisdiction, or a substantial effect on the butchers' workload, the marketing-hours restriction is either little different in effect from the valid working-hours provision that work shall stop at 6 p. m. or is necessary to protect other concerns of the union members. If the unions' factual premises are true, we think the unions could impose a restriction on night operations without violation of the Sherman Act; for then operating hours, like working hours, would constitute a subject of immediate and legitimate concern to union members.\n\nJewel alleges on the other hand that the night operation of self-service markets requires no butcher to be in attendance and does not infringe any other legitimate union concern. Customers serve themselves; and if owners want to forgo furnishing the services of a butcher to give advice or to make special cuts, this is not the unions' concern since their desire to avoid night work is fully satisfied and no other legitimate interest is being infringed. In short, the connection between working hours and operating hours in the case of the self-service market is said to be so attenuated as to bring the provision within the prohibition of the Sherman Act.\n\nIf it were true that self-service markets could actually operate without butchers, at least for a few hours after 6 p. m., that no encroachment on butchers' work would result and that the workload of butchers during normal working hours would not be substantially increased. Jewel's position would have considerable merit. For then the obvious restraint on the product market - the exclusion of self-service stores from the evening market for meat - would stand alone, unmitigated and unjustified by the vital interests of the union butchers which are relied upon in this case. In such event the limitation imposed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 693]\n\u00a0\n by the unions might well be reduced to nothing but an effort by the unions to protect one group of employers from competition by another, which is conduct that is not exempt from the Sherman Act. Whether there would be a violation of 1 and 2 would then depend on whether the elements of a conspiracy in restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize had been proved.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 694]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThus the dispute between Jewel and the unions essentially concerns a narrow factual question: Are might operations without butchers, and without infringement of butchers' interests, feasible? The District Court resolved this factual dispute in favor of the unions. It found that \"in stores where meat is sold at night it is impractical to operate without either butchers or other employees. Someone must arrange, replenish and clean the counters and supply customer services.\" Operating without butchers would mean that \"their work would be done by others unskilled in the trade,\" and \"would involve an increase in workload in preparing for the night work and cleaning the next morning.\" 215 F. Supp., at 846. Those findings were not disturbed by the Court of Appeals, which, as previously noted, proceeded on a broader ground. Our function is limited to reviewing the record to satisfy ourselves that the trial judge's findings are not clearly erroneous. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 52 (a).\n\nThe trial court had before it evidence concerning the history of the unions' opposition to night work, the development of the provisions respecting night work and night operations, the course of collective bargaining negotiations in 1957, 1959, and 1961\n7\n with regard to those provisions, and the characteristics of meat marketing insofar as they bore on the feasibility of night operations without butchers.\n\nThe unions' opposition to night work has a long history. Prior to 1919 the operating hours of meat markets in Chicago were 7 a. m. to 7 p. m., Monday through Friday; \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 695]\n\u00a0\n 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. on Saturday, and 7 a. m. to 1 p. m. on Sunday. Butchers worked the full 81-hour, seven-day week. The Chicago butchers' strike of 1919 was much concerned with shortening working hours, and the resulting contract, signed in 1920, set the working day at 8 a. m. to 6 p. m., Monday through Friday, and 8 a. m. to 9 p. m. on Saturday. Various alterations in the hours were made in 1937, 1941, 1945, 1946, and again in 1947, when the present working hours (9 a. m. to 6 p. m., Monday through Saturday) were established. In a mail ballot conducted by the unions in October 1962, Jewel's meat cutters voted 759 to 28 against night work.\n\nConcomitant with the unions' concern with the working hours of butchers was their interest in the hours during which customers might be served. The 1920 agreement provided that \"no customers will be served who come into the market after 6 P. M. and 9 P. M. on Saturdays and on days preceding holidays . . . .\" That provision was continued until 1947, when it was superseded by the formulation presently in effect and here claimed to be unlawful:\n\n\"Market operating hours shall be 9:00 a. m. to 6:00 p. m. Monday through Saturday, inclusive. No customer shall be served who comes into the market before or after the hours set forth above.\"\n\n\n In 1947, Jewel had just started investigating the self-service method of meat vending. It introduced that method in the Chicago area in 1948 and in the territory of these unions in 1953.\n\nDuring the 1957 negotiations numerous proposals for relaxation of the operating-hours restriction were presented by the employer group. Each of these proposals, including that submitted separately by Jewel for consideration at the unions' ratification meetings, combined a provision for night operations with a provision for a more flexible workday that would permit night employment \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 696]\n\u00a0\n of butchers. Such juxtaposition of the two provisions could, of course, only serve to reinforce the unions' fears that night operations meant night work. Jewel did allege in its complaint, filed in July 1958, that night operations were possible without butchers, but even in the 1959 bargaining sessions Jewel failed to put forth any plan for night operations that did not also include night work. Finally, toward the end of the 1961 negotiations. Jewel did make such a suggestion, but, as the trial judge remarked, the \"unions questioned the seriousness of that proposal under the circumstances.\" 215 F. Supp., at 843.\n\nThe unions' evidence with regard to the practicability of night operations without butchers was accurately summarized by the trial judge as follows:\n\n \"[I]n most of plaintiff's stores outside Chicago,  where night operations exist, meat cutters are on  duty whenever a meat department is open after  6 P. M. . . . Even in self-service departments, ostensibly  operated without employees on duty after  6 P. M., there was evidence that requisite customer  services in connection with meat sales were performed  by grocery clerks. In the same vein, defendants  adduced evidence that in the sale of delicatessen  items, which could be made after 6 P. M. from self-service  cases under the contract, `practically' always  during the time the market was open the manager  or other employees, would be rearranging and restocking  the cases. There was also evidence that  even if it were practical to operate a self-service meat  market after 6 P. M. without employees, the night  operations would add to the workload in getting the  meats prepared for night sales and in putting the  counters in order the next day.\" 215 F. Supp., at  844. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 697]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Jewel challenges the unions' evidence on each of these points - arguing, for example, that its preference to have butchers on duty at night, where possible under the union contract, is not probative of the feasibility of not having butchers on duty and that the evidence that grocery clerks performed customer services within the butchers' jurisdiction was based on a single instance resulting from \"entrapment\" by union agents. But Jewel's argument - when considered against the historical background of union concern with working hours and operating hours and the virtually uniform recognition by employers of the intimate relationship between the two subjects, as manifested by bargaining proposals in 1957, 1959, and 1961 - falls far short of a showing that the trial judge's ultimate findings were clearly erroneous.\n\n       Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The practice in the Chicago area is for the employers and the butchers to execute separate, but similar, collective bargaining agreements for self-service and service markets. A self-service market is \"one in which fresh beef, veal, lamb, mutton or port are available for sale on a prepackage self-service basis.\" Semi-self-service markets, those in which fresh meat is made available on a prepackaged basis but there is also a service counter offering custom cutting for those who prefer it, are governed by the self-service contract. Service markets are those in which no fresh meat is made available on a self-service basis.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Action upon the separate petition of Associated and Bromann, No. 321 Oct. Term, 1964, has been withheld, pending disposition of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The grant of certiorari was limited to the following questions:\n\n\"1. Based on the District Court's undisturbed finding that the limitation `was imposed after arm's length bargaining, . . . and was fashioned exclusively by the unions to serve their own interests - how long and what hours members shall work, what work they shall do, and what pay they shall receive,' whether the limitation upon market operating hours and the controversy concerning it are within the labor exemption of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n\n\"2. Whether a claimed violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act which falls within the regulatory scope of the National Labor Relations Act is within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] To be distinguished are the pre-emption cases in which the possibility that the Board may not exercise jurisdiction renders state courts no less powerless to act, see San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236, 245\n-246. See generally, Teamsters Local 20 v. Morton, \n377 \nU.S. 252\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The crucial determinant is not the form of the agreement - e. g., prices or wages - but its relative impact on the product market and the interests of union members. Thus in Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n, we held that federal labor policy precluded application of state antitrust laws to an employer-union agreement that when leased trucks were driven by their owners, such owner-drivers should receive, in addition to the union wage, not less than a prescribed minimum rental. Though in form a scheme fixing prices for the supply of leased vehicles, the agreement was designed \"to protect the negotiated wage scale against the possible undermining through diminution of the owner's wages for driving which might result from a rental which did not cover his operating costs.\" Id., at 293-294. As the agreement did not embody a \"`remote and indirect approach to the subject of wages' . . . but a direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure established by the collective bargaining contract,\" id., at 294, the paramount federal policy of encouraging collective bargaining proscribed application of the state law. See also Meat Drivers v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 94, 98\n; Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, Local No. 753 v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] One issue, for example, would be whether the restraint was unreasonable. Judicial pronouncements regarding the reasonableness of restraints on hours of business are relatively few. Some cases appear to have viewed such restraints as tantamount to limits on hours of work and thus reasonable, even though contained in agreements among competitors. Thus in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231\n, the Court upheld a rule of a grain exchange that had the form of a restriction on prices of transactions outside regular trading hours but was characterized by the Court as a rule designed to shift transactions to the regular trading period, i. e., to limit hours of operation. The Court, per Mr. Justice Brandeis, stated:\n\n\"Every board of trade and nearly every trade organization imposes some restraint upon the conduct of business by its members. Those relating to the hours in which business may be done are common; and they make a special appeal where, as here, they tend to shorten the working day or, at least, limit the period of most exacting activity.\" \n246 \nU.S., at 241\n. (Emphasis added.) See also La Duc v. Teamsters & Chauffeurs Union, Local No. 43, 1946-1947 Trade Cas., \u00a7 57,631 (Wis. Cir. Ct. 1947); Cielesz v. Local 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters, 25 Ill. App. 2d 491, 167 N. E. 2d 302 (1960).\n\n\n Other cases have upheld operating-hours restraints in factual circumstances that make it seem likely that the agreement affected hours of operation and hours of work in equal measure but without stressing that fact. See Dunkel Oil Corp. v. Anich, 1944-1945 Trade Cas., \u00a7 57,306 (D.C. E. D. Ill. 1944); Baker v. Retail Clerks Assn., 313 Ill. App. 432, 40 N. E. 2d 571 (1942); Stovall v. McCutchen, 107 Ky. 577, 54 S. W. 969 (1900).\n\nKold Kist, Inc. v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters, Local No. 421, 99 Cal. App. 2d 191, 221 P.2d 724 (1950), held unreasonable a union-employer agreement limiting night sales of frozen poultry, which had previously been obtained from the plaintiff-distributor. The plaintiff alleged, however, that it had been severely affected, since many stores had stopped carrying its products entirely due to the lack of storage \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 694]\n\u00a0\n facilities in which to keep the poultry during hours in which sale was prohibited, and such effects may be atypical.\n\nThe decided cases thus do not appear to offer any easy answer to the question whether in a particular case an operating-hours restraint is unreasonable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In 1959, and again in 1961, new collective bargaining agreements containing the challenged provision were executed. In each instance, Jewel reserved its position with respect to this litigation.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting from the opinion but concurring in the reversal in No. 48 and concurring in the judgment of the Court in No. 240.\n\nStripped of all the pejorative adjectives and reduced to their essential facts, both Pennington and Jewel Tea represent refusals by judges to give full effect to congressional action designed to prohibit judicial intervention via the antitrust route in legitimate collective bargaining. The history of these cases furnishes fresh evidence of the observation that in this area, necessarily involving a determination of \"what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands,\" Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 479\n, 485 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis), \"courts have neither the aptitude nor the criteria for reaching sound decisions.\" Cox, Labor and the Antitrust Laws - A Preliminary Analysis, 104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 252, 269-270 (1955); see Winter, Collective Bargaining and Competition: The Application of Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L. J. 14 (1963). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 698]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nPennington presents a case of a union negotiating with the employers in the industry for wages, fringe benefits, and working conditions. Despite allegations of conspiracy, which connotes clandestine activities, it is no secret that the United Mine Workers, acting to further what it considers to be the best interests of its members, espouses a philosophy of achieving uniform high wages, fringe benefits, and good working conditions. As the quid pro quo for this, the Union is willing to accept the burdens and consequences of automation. Further, it acts upon the view that the existence of marginal operators who cannot afford these high wages, fringe benefits, and good working conditions does not serve the best interests of the working miner but, on the contrary, depresses wage standards and perpetuates undesirable conditions. This has been the articulated policy of the Union since 1933. See Baratz, The Union and the Coal Industry 62-74 (1955). The Mine Workers has openly stated its preference, if need be, for a reduced working force in the industry, with those employed working at high wages, rather than for greater total employment at lesser wage rates. Ibid. See also Folliard, Roar of John L. Lewis Subdued at 85, The Washington Post, Feb. 14. 1965, E, p. 3; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S. Res. 274, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 1-10; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor, Welfare of Miners, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; 1 Proceedings of Forty-Second Consecutive Constitutional Convention of the United Mine Workers of America. 9-14 (1956). Consistent with this view, the Union welcomes automation, insisting only that the workers participate in its benefits.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 699]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJewel Tea presents another and different aspect of collective bargaining philosophy. The Chicago Local of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters bargains for its members with small, independent service butchers as well as large automated self-service chains. It seeks from both a uniform policy that no fresh meat be sold after 6 p. m. This union policy, as my Brother WHITE recognizes, ante, at 694-696, has a long history dating back to 1919 and has grown out of the Union's struggle to reduce the long, arduous hours worked by butchers, which in 1919 were 81 hours per week. It took a long strike to achieve the first limitation on hours in 1920, and it has required hard extensive collective bargaining since then to maintain the policy and further reduce the number of hours worked. While it is claimed by Jewel Tea, a large operator of automated self-service markets, that it can operate beyond the set hours without increasing the work of butchers or having others do butchers' work - a claim rejected by the trial court and the majority of this Court - it is conceded, on this record, that the small, independent service operators cannot do so. Therefore to the extent that the Union's uniform policy limiting hours of selling fresh meat has the effect of aiding one group of employers at the expense of another, here the union policy, unlike that in Pennington, aids the small employers at the expense of the large.\n\nAlthough evidencing these converse economic effects, both Pennington and Jewel Tea, as the Court in Pennington, and my Brother WHITE'S opinion in Jewel Tea \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 700]\n\u00a0\n acknowledge, involve conventional collective bargaining on wages, hours, and working conditions - mandatory subjects of bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d) (1958 ed.). Yet the Mine Workers' activity in Pennington was held subject to an antitrust action by two lower courts. This decision was based upon a jury determination that the Union's economic philosophy is undesirable, and it resulted in an award against the Union of treble damages of $270,000 and $55,000 extra for respondent's attorney's fees. In Jewel Tea, the Union has also been subjected to an antitrust suit in which a court of appeals, with its own notions as to what butchers are legitimately interested in, would subject the Union to a treble damage judgment in an as yet undetermined amount.\n\nRegretfully these cases, both in the lower courts and in expressions in the various opinions filed today in this Court, as I shall demonstrate, constitute a throwback to past days when courts allowed antitrust actions against unions and employers engaged in conventional collective bargaining, because \"a judge considered\" the union or employer conduct in question to be \"socially or economically\" objectionable. Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, at 485 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis). It is necessary to recall that history to place the cases before us in proper perspective.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1 et seq. (1958 ed.), \"was enacted in the era of `trust' and of `combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern.\" Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469, 492\n-493. Despite the fact that the Act was therefore aimed at business combinations, not labor unions, and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 701]\n\u00a0\n that a careful reading of the legislative history shows that the interdiction of \"every\" contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade was not intended to apply to labor unions and the activities of labor unions in their own interests, aimed at promotion of the labor conditions of their members,\n2\n the Court in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, held that the Act proscribed activities of labor unions and, in that case, prohibited the use of a secondary boycott as part of an organizational campaign. Congress responded by adopting in 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 738, 15 U.S.C. 17, 29 U.S.C. 52 (1958 ed.), what has come to be known as the labor exemption from the Sherman Act. See Frankfurter & Greene, The Labor Injunction 139-144 (1930). Section 6 states: \"The labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce. Nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor . . . organizations, instituted for the purposes of mutual help . . . or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof. . . .\"\n3\n Section \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 702]\n\u00a0\n 20 barred federal court injunctions \"in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees\" involving a dispute over terms and conditions of employment. It specifically prohibited issuance of injunctions against certain activities such as quitting work, persuading others to do the same, etc., and concluded with the provision: \"nor shall any of the acts specified . . . be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.\"\n\nThese congressional provisions, however, were frustrated, as thoughtful commentators have acknowledged, by decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Frankfurter & Greene, op. cit. supra, at 165-176; Cox, op. cit. supra, at 257-258. See also H. R. Rep. No. 669, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 3, 7-8. In Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, the Court was again faced with a secondary boycott used as an organizational tool, that is, a post-Clayton Act Lawlor situation. Despite the Act, the Court again held the activity to violate the Sherman Act on the basis that 6 did not confer immunity from antitrust liabilities \"where . . . [unions] depart from . . . normal and legitimate objects . . . .\" Id., at 469. What constitutes a \"normal and legitimate\" union object was to be determined by the courts; the Duplex Court held that a secondary boycott was not such an object. Section 20 was swept away on the ground that it only applied to controversies between \"employers and employees,\" and that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 703]\n\u00a0\n \"it would do violence to the . . . language employed\" id., at 472, to hold that the section included an attempt to organize a new employer. Mr. Justice Brandeis, in dissent (joined by Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Clarke), forcefully argued that the decision of the majority violated the clear congressional purpose to remove from judges the determination of \"what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands,\" id., at 485, and to \"declare the right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest . . . .\" Id., at 488.\n\nDuplex was followed by other decisions of this Court and lower federal courts which sustained the application of the antitrust laws to curb both primary and secondary union activity. See, e. g., Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters Assn., \n274 \nU.S. 37\n; Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295\n; Alco-Zander Co. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, 35 F.2d 203 (D.C. E. D. Pa.); United States v. Railway Employees' Dept., 283 F. 479 (D.C. N. D. Ill.).\n\nMr. Justice Brandeis' dissent in Duplex has, however, carried the day in the courts of history as evidenced by subsequent congressional action and decisions of this Court. The Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C. 101 (1958 ed.), was passed by Congress in 1932 expressly to overrule the majority opinion of Duplex and the cases that followed it and to affirm the philosophy of the dissenters in those cases. See United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219, 235\n-236; Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91, 102\n-103; New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552, 562\n.\n4\n Although framed in terms of restrictions \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 704]\n\u00a0\n on the use of injunctions, this Court in United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219, 235\n-236, recognized that the Act's \"underlying aim . . . was to restore the broad purpose which Congress thought it had formulated in the Clayton Act but which was frustrated . . . .\" See H. R. Rep. No. 669, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 6-8. As this Court has recognized, congressional enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act \"was prompted by a desire . . . to withdraw federal courts from a type of controversy for which many believed they were ill-suited and from participation in which, it was feared, judicial prestige might suffer.\" Marine Cooks & Stewards v. Panama S. S. Co., \n362 \nU.S. 365, 370\n, n. 7. The Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq. (1958 ed.), followed the Norris-LaGuardia Act and gave affirmative protection and encouragement to union organization and collective bargaining and further reflected congressional desire to narrow the judiciary's role in the formulation of labor policy by entrusting principal enforcement responsibility to an administrative agency.\n\nFollowing adoption of the Norris-LaGuardia and Wagner Acts, in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n, the Court gave proper recognition to congressional purpose in this area. In holding that union use of a sit-down strike as an organizational tool did not violate the antitrust laws, even though attended with violence, the Court stated:\n\n \"Strikes or agreements not to work, entered into by laborers to compel employers to yield to their demands, may restrict to some extent the power of employers who are parties to the dispute to compete in the market with those not subject to such demands. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 705]\n\u00a0\n But . . . the mere fact of such restrictions on competition does not in itself bring the parties to the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act. . . . Furthermore, successful union activity, as for example consummation of a wage agreement with employers, may have some influence on price competition by eliminating that part of such competition which is based on differences in labor standards. Since, in order to render a labor combination effective it must eliminate the competition from nonunion made goods, . . . an elimination of price competition based on differences in labor standards is the objective of any national labor organization. But this effect on competition has not been considered to be the kind of curtailment of price competition prohibited by the Sherman Act.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n310 \nU.S., at 503\n-504.\n\n\n Apex was followed by the Court in United States v. Hutcheson, supra, which has been recognized as a landmark case. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, after an extensive review of the history of the application of the antitrust laws to labor unions, concluded, for the Court, that \"whether trade union conduct constitutes a violation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 706]\n\u00a0\n of the Sherman Law is to be determined only by reading the Sherman Law and 20 of the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act as a harmonizing text of outlawry of labor conduct.\" \n312 \nU.S., at 231\n. The Court then went on to hold: \"So long as a union acts in its self interest and does not combine with non-labor groups,\n6\n the licit and the illicit . . . are not to be distinguished by any judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means.\" \n312 \nU.S., at 232\n.\n\nIn Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n, the only relevant case in this area since Hutcheson, the Court reaffirmed the Hutcheson holding \"that a union's exemption from the Sherman Act is not to be determined by a judicial `judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means.'\" \n325 \nU.S., at 810\n-811. The Court, however, held that the Union was subject to Sherman Act liability on the facts of the case as there were \"industry-wide understandings, looking not merely to terms and conditions of employment but also to price and market control. Agencies were set up composed of representatives of all three groups [the union-contractor-manufacturer combination] to boycott recalcitrant local contractors and manufacturers and to bar from the [New York City] area equipment manufactured outside its boundaries.\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 707]\n\u00a0\n \n325 \nU.S., at 799\n-800. And \"this combination of business men\" \"intended to and did restrain trade in and monopolize the supply of electrical equipment in the New York City area to the exclusion of equipment manufactured in and shipped from other states, and did also control its price and discriminate between its would-be customers.\" \n325 \nU.S., at 800\n-801. Thus Allen Bradley involved two elements: (1) union participation in price fixing and market allocation, with the only union interest being the indirect prospect that these anti competitive devices might increase employers' profits which might then trickle down to the employees, (2) accomplished by the union's joining a combination or conspiracy of the employers.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nTo round out this history it should be noted that, while rejecting attempts to restrict or eliminate the labor exemption from the antitrust laws,\n8\n Congress, in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq. (1958 ed.), and the 1959 Landrum-Griffin Act, 73 Stat. 519, 29 U.S.C. 401 et seq. (1958 ed., Supp. V), has taken steps to proscribe union activities which, in its legislative judgment, it considers to be detrimental to the public good. Consistent, however, with its policy of not turning the lawfulness of union conduct on subjective judgments of purpose or effect, a policy expressed in 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act and in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, Congress did this by making unlawful certain specific union activities under the National Labor \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 708]\n\u00a0\n Relations Act, Congress, for example has curbed the secondary boycott in 8 (b) (4) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, preserving from condemnation certain secondary activities deemed legitimate.\n9\n The jurisdictional strike is regulated by 8 (b) (4) (D) in conjunction with 10 (k) of the Act.\n10\n Union opposition to automation has been regulated to the limited extent Congress wished to do so by 8 (b) (6) of the Act.\n11\n Strikes and pressure by minority unions for organization or recognition are controlled by 8 (b) (4) (C) and 8 (b) (7) of the Act.\n12\n Union restrictions on contracting out and subcontracting of work are delineated by 8 (e) of the Act.\n13\n For the issue presently before us, it is most \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 709]\n\u00a0\n significant that in enacting this last prohibition, Congress in the exercise of its legislative judgment, specifically excepted the unusual situations existing in the garment and building industries. Such exceptions for particular industries, which may be proper subjects of legislative discretion, would, of course, be most difficult for courts to make in employing a broad proscription like the Sherman Act.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nIn my view, this history shows a consistent congressional purpose to limit severely judicial intervention in collective bargaining under cover of the wide umbrella of the antitrust laws, and, rather, to deal with what Congress deemed to be specific abuses on the part of labor unions by specific proscriptions in the labor statutes. I believe that the Court should respect this history of congressional purpose and should reaffirm the Court's holdings in Apex and Hutcheson which, unlike earlier decisions, gave effect to, rather than frustrated, the congressional design. The sound approach of Hutcheson is that the labor exemption from the antitrust laws derives from a synthesis of all pertinent congressional legislation - the nature of the Sherman Act itself,\n14\n 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n15\n the Walsh-Healey\n16\n and Davis-Bacon\n17\n Acts, and the Wagner Act with its Taft-Hartley and Landrum-Griffin amendments. This last statute, in particular, provides \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 710]\n\u00a0\n that both employers and unions must bargain over \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\" 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (5), (b) (3), (d) (1958 ed.). Following the sound analysis of Hutcheson, the Court should hold that, in order to effectuate congressional intent, collective bargaining activity concerning mandatory subjects of bargaining under the Labor Act is not subject to the antitrust laws.\n18\n This rule flows directly from the Hutcheson holding that a union acting as a union, in the interests of its members, and not acting to fix prices or allocate markets in aid of an employer conspiracy to accomplish these objects, with only indirect union benefits, is not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws. To hold that mandatory collective bargaining is completely protected would effectuate the congressional policies of encouraging free collective bargaining, subject only to specific restrictions contained in the labor laws, and of limiting judicial intervention in labor matters via the antitrust route - an intervention which necessarily under the Sherman Act places on judges and juries the determination of \"what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands.\" Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, at 485 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis). See Winter, Collective Bargaining and Competition: The Application of Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L. J. 14 (1963).\n\nSection 6 of the Clayton Act made it clear half a century ago that it is not national policy to force workers to compete in the \"sale\" of their labor as if it were a commodity or article of commerce. The policy was confirmed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 711]\n\u00a0\n and extended in the subsequent Norris-LaGuardia Act. Other federal legislation establishing minimum wages and maximum hours takes labor standards out of competition. The Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 201-219 (1958 ed.), clearly states that the existence of \"labor conditions\" insufficient for a \"minimum standard of living . . . constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce.\" 29 U.S.C. 202 (a). Moreover, this Court has recognized that in the Walsh-Healey Act, 49 Stat. 2036, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 35-45 (1958 ed.), Congress brought to bear the \"leverage of the Government's immense purchasing power to raise labor standards\" by eliminating substandard producers from eligibility for public contracts. Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, \n317 \nU.S. 501, 507\n. See also Davis-Bacon Act, 46 Stat. 1494, 40 U.S.C. 276a (1958 ed.). The National Labor Relations Act itself clearly expresses one of its purposes to be \"the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.\" 29 U.S.C. 151. In short, business competition based on wage competition is not national policy and \"the mere fact of such restrictions on competition does not . . . bring the parties . . . within the condemnation of the Sherman Act.\" Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, at 503.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act also declares it to be the policy of the United States to promote the establishment of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment by free collective bargaining between employers and unions. The Act further provides that both employers and unions must bargain about such mandatory subjects of bargaining. This national scheme would be virtually destroyed by the imposition of Sherman Act criminal and civil penalties upon employers and unions engaged in such collective bargaining. To tell the parties \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 712]\n\u00a0\n that they must bargain about a point but may be subject to antitrust penalties if they reach an agreement is to stultify the congressional scheme.\n\nMoreover, mandatory subjects of bargaining are issues as to which union strikes may not be enjoined by either federal or state courts.\n19\n To say that the union can strike over such issues but that both it and the employer are subject to possible antitrust penalties for making collective bargaining agreements concerning them is to assert that Congress intended to permit the parties to collective bargaining to wage industrial warfare but to prohibit them from peacefully settling their disputes. This would not only be irrational but would fly in the face of the clear congressional intent of promoting \"the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by subjecting labor-management controversies to the mediatory influence of negotiation.\" Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. v. Labor Board, \n379 \nU.S. 203, 211\n.\n\nCongress has also recognized that some labor organizations seek, as in Pennington, through industry-wide bargaining, to eliminate differences in labor standards among employers. This was common knowledge in 1935 when the Wagner Act was enacted. The aims and practices of unions engaging in industry-wide bargaining were well known in 1947 at the time of the Taft-Hartley revision. Then and on subsequent occasions Congress refused \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 713]\n\u00a0\n to enact bills to restrict or prohibit industry-wide bargaining. See, e. g., H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (16), 9 (f) (1), 12 (a) (3) (A), 12 (a) (4), H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 24, 73; note 8, supra, and citations contained therein; H. R. 8449, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. Nor can it be seriously argued that multi-employer bargaining, as in Jewel Tea, introduces an illegal element or is otherwise opposed to the national labor policy. Indeed, this Court, to implement congressional policy sanctioning multi-employer bargaining, permitted employers to resort, under certain circumstances, to lockouts to protect the integrity of the multi-employer bargaining unit. See Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, No. 449, \n353 \nU.S. 87\n; Labor Board v. Brown, \n380 \nU.S. 278\n.\n20\n The wisdom of permitting industry-wide and multi-employer bargaining is for Congress to decide, unless this Court is to return to the discredited approach of the majority in Duplex and substitute its notion for that of Congress as to how unions and employers should conduct their collective bargaining.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe Court in Pennington today ignores this history of the discredited judicial attempt to apply the antitrust laws to legitimate collective bargaining activity, and it \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 714]\n\u00a0\n flouts the clearly expressed congressional intent that, since \"[t]he labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce,\"\n21\n the antitrust laws do not proscribe, and the national labor policy affirmatively promotes, the \"elimination of price competition based on differences in labor standards.\" Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, at 503. While purporting to recognize the indisputable fact that the elimination of employer competition based on substandard labor conditions is a proper labor union objective endorsed by our national labor policy and that, therefore, \"a union may make wage agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit and may in pursuance of its own union interests seek to obtain the same terms from other employers.\" Pennington, ante, at 665, the Court holds that \"a union forfeits its exemption from the antitrust laws when it is clearly shown that it has agreed with one set of employers to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units.\" Ibid.\n\nThis rule seems to me clearly contrary to the congressional purpose manifested by the labor statutes, and it will severely restrict free collective bargaining. Since collective bargaining inevitably involves and requires discussion of the impact of the wage agreement reached with a particular employer or group of employers upon competing employers, the effect of the Court's decision will be to bar a basic element of collective bargaining from the conference room. If a union and employer are prevented from discussing and agreeing upon issues which are, in the great majority of cases, at the central core of bargaining, unilateral force will inevitably be substituted for rational discussion and agreement. Plainly and simply, the Court would subject both unions and employers to antitrust sanctions, criminal as well as civil, if in collective bargaining they concluded a wage agreement and, as part of the agreement, the union has undertaken to use its best efforts \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 715]\n\u00a0\n to have this wage accepted by other employers in the industry. Indeed, the decision today even goes beyond this. Under settled antitrust principles which are accepted by the Court as appropriate and applicable, which were the basis for jury instructions in Pennington, and which will govern it upon remand, there need not be direct evidence of an express agreement. Rather the existence of such an agreement, express or implied, may be inferred from the conduct of the parties. See, e. g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208\n; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 781\n; United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., \n334 \nU.S. 131\n; Theater Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., \n346 \nU.S. 537\n. Or, as my Brother DOUGLAS, concurring in Pennington, would have it, conduct of the parties could be prima facie evidence of an illegal agreement. Ante, at 673. As the facts of Pennington illustrate, the jury is therefore at liberty to infer such an agreement from \"clear\" evidence that a union's philosophy that high wages and mechanization are desirable has been accepted by a group of employers and that the union has attempted to achieve like acceptance from other employers. For, as I have pointed out, stripped of all adjectives, this is what Pennington presents. Yet the Court today holds \"the alleged agreement between UMW and the large operators to secure uniform labor standards throughout the industry, if proved, was not exempt from the antitrust laws.\" Ante, at 669.\n\nThe rational thing for an employer to do, when faced with union demands he thinks he cannot meet, is to explain why, in economic terms, he believes that he cannot agree to the union requests. Indeed, the Labor Act's compulsion to bargain in good faith requires that he meaningfully address himself to the union's requests. See Labor Board v. Truitt Mfg. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 149\n. A recurring and most understandable reason given by employers for their resistance to union demands is that competitive \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 716]\n\u00a0\n factors prevent them from accepting the union's proposed terms. Under the Court's holding today, however, such a statement by an employer may start both the employer and union on the road to antitrust sanctions, criminal and civil. For a jury may well interpret such discussion and subsequent union action as showing an implicit or secret agreement to impose uniform standards on other employers. Nor does the Court's requirement that there be \"direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy,\" ante, at 665, n. 2 - whatever those undefined terms in the opinion may mean - provide any substantial safeguard for uninhibited collective bargaining discussions. In Pennington itself, the trial court instructed the jury that a union's unilateral actions did not subject it to antitrust sanctions, and yet the jury readily inferred a \"conspiracy\" from the \"direct or indirect evidence\" of the union's publicly stated policy in favor of high wages and mechanization, its collective bargaining agreement with a group of employers establishing high wages, and its attempts to obtain similar high wages from other employers.\n\nFurthermore, in order to determine whether, under the Court's standard, a union is acting unilaterally or pursuant to an agreement with employers, judges and juries will inevitably be drawn to try to determine the purpose and motive of union and employer collective bargaining activities. The history I have set out, however, makes clear that Congress intended to foreclose judges and juries from roaming at large in the area of collective bargaining, under cover of the antitrust laws, by inquiry into the purpose and motive of the employer and union bargaining on mandatory subjects. Such roaming at large, experience shows, leads to a substitution of judicial for congressional judgment as to how collective bargaining should operate.\n\nThe case of Alco-Zander Co. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, 35 F.2d 203 (D.C. E. D. Pa.), is one example of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 717]\n\u00a0\n judicial inadequacy in this sensitive economic area. That case involved a situation where the unionized garment industry in New York was being undersold by the lower priced, nonunion garment industry of Philadelphia. The union, fearing for the future of the jobs of its members employed in the unionized New York industry, started an organizing drive in Philadelphia. A federal district court enjoined, as a violation of the antitrust laws, the union's organizational campaign which consisted of primary strikes and peaceful picketing. The court declared that \"the primary purpose of the campaign for the unionization of the Philadelphia market was the protection of the unionized markets in other states,\" and that \"the object of the strikes was to put an end to all production in Philadelphia under nonunion conditions and only to permit it to be resumed if and when the manufacturers were willing to operate upon an union basis and under union wage scales.\" 35 F.2d, at 205. It is clear, therefore, that the court enjoined the union's activities as antitrust violations because it believed that this purpose and object was socially and economically undesirable. Alco-Zander and other similar cases\n22\n were almost universally condemned as striking examples of judicial interference in legitimate collective bargaining via the antitrust laws because of judge-made notions as to the economic wisdom of the union conduct. See, e. g., Berman, Labor and the Sherman Act 248-259 (1930); Comment, 24 Ill. L. Rev. 925 (1930). There is no doubt that the Norris-LaGuardia \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 718]\n\u00a0\n Act was designed to overrule them. See H. R. Rep. No. 669, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 3-7; S. Rep. No. 163, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 9-10.\n\nCongress in the Norris-LaGuardia Act and other labor statutes, as this Court recognized in Apex and Hutcheson determined that judicial notions of the social and economic desirability of union action should not govern antitrust liability in the area of collective bargaining. The fact that a purpose-motive approach necessarily opens the door to basing criminal or civil penalties under the Sherman Act on just such a determination and to making courts the arbiters of our national labor policy is borne out not only by the history of cases like Alco-Zander but also by the cases decided today.\n\nIn Pennington, central to the alleged conspiracy is the claim that hourly wage rates and fringe benefits were set at a level designed to eliminate the competition of the smaller nonunion companies by making the labor cost too high for them to pay. Indeed, the trial judge charged that there was no violation of the Sherman Act in the establishing of wages and welfare payments through the national contract, \"provided\" the mine workers and the major coal producers had not agreed to fix \"high\" rates \"in order to drive the small coal operators out of business.\" Under such an instruction, if the jury found the wage scale too \"high\" it could impute to the union the unlawful purpose of putting the nonunion operators out of business. It is clear that the effect of the instruction therefore, was to invite 12 jurymen to become arbiters of the economic desirability of the wage scale in the Nation's coal industry. The Court would sustain the judgment based on this charge and thereby put its stamp of approval on this role for courts and juries.\n\nThe Court's approval of judges and juries determining the permissible wage scale for working men in an industry is confirmed by the Court's express statement \"there are \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 719]\n\u00a0\n limits to what a union or an employer may offer or extract in the name of wages,\" Pennington, ante, at 665. To allow a jury to infer an illegal \"conspiracy\" from the agreed-upon wage scale means that the jury must determine at what level the wages could be fixed without impelling the parties into the ambit of the antitrust laws. Is this not another way of saying that, via the antitrust route, a judge or jury may determine, according to its own notions of what is economically sound, the amount of wages that a union can properly ask for or that an employer can pay? It is clear, as experience shows, that judges and juries neither have the aptitude nor possess the criteria for making this kind of judgment. In Pennington, absent the alleged conspiracy, would the wage rate and fringe benefits have been lower? Should they have been lower? If Pennington were an action for injunctive relief, what would be the appropriate remedy to reach the labor cost which is at the heart of the alleged antitrust violation? A judicial determination of the wage rate? A judicial nullification of the existing rate with a direction to negotiate a lower one? I cannot believe that Congress has sanctioned judicial wage control under the umbrella of the Sherman Act, for, absent a national emergency,\n23\n Congress has never legislated wage control in our free-enterprise economy.\n\nThe history I have set out makes clear that Congress intended to foreclose judges and juries from making essentially economic judgments in antitrust actions by determining whether unions or employers had good or bad motives for their agreements on subjects of mandatory bargaining. Moreover, an attempted inquiry into the motives of employers or unions for entering into collective bargaining agreements on subjects of mandatory bargaining \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 720]\n\u00a0\n is totally artificial. It is precisely in this area of wages, hours, and other working conditions that Congress has recognized that unions have a substantial, direct, and basic interest of their own to advance.\n\nAs I have discussed, the Court's test is not essentially different from the discredited purpose-motive approach. Only rarely will there be direct evidence of an express agreement between a union and an employer to impose a particular wage scale on other employers. In most cases, as was true of Pennington, the trial court will instruct the jury that such an illegal agreement may be inferred from the conduct - \"indirect evidence\" - of the union and employers. To allow a court or a jury to infer an illegal agreement from collective bargaining conduct inevitably requires courts and juries to analyze the terms of collective bargaining agreements and the purposes and motives of unions and employers in agreeing upon them. Moreover, the evidence most often available to sustain antitrust liability under the Court's theory would show, as it did in Pennington, simply that the motives of the union and employer coincide - the union seeking high wages and protection from low-wage, nonunion competition, and the employer who pays high wages seeking protection from competitors who pay lower wages. When there is this coincidence of motive, does the illegality of the \"conspiracy\" turn on whether the Union pursued its goal of a uniform wage policy through strikes and not negotiation? As I read the Court's opinion this is precisely what the result turns on and thus unions are forced, in order to show that they have not illegally \"agreed\" with employers, to pursue their aims through strikes and not negotiations. Yet, it is clear that such a result was precisely what the National Labor Relations Act was designed to prevent. The only alternative to resolution of collective bargaining issues by force available to the parties under the Court's holding is the encouragement of fraud and deceit. An employer will be forced to take a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 721]\n\u00a0\n public stand against a union's wage demands, even if he is willing to accept them, lest a too ready acceptance be used by a jury to infer an agreement between the union and employer that the same wages will be sought from other employers. Yet, I have always thought that in collective bargaining, even more than in other areas of contractual agreement, the objective is open covenants openly arrived at.\n\nFurthermore, I do not understand how an inquiry can be formulated in terms of whether the union action is unilateral or is a consequence of a \"conspiracy\" with employers independently of the economic terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The agreement must be admitted into evidence and the Court holds that its economic consequences are relevant. In the end, one way or another, the entire panoply of economic fact becomes involved, and judges and juries under the Court's view would then be allowed to speculate about why a union bargained for increased compensation, or any other labor standard within the scope of mandatory bargaining. It is precisely this type of speculation that Congress has rejected.\n\nThe plain fact is that it makes no sense to turn antitrust liability of employers and unions concerning subjects of mandatory bargaining on whether the union acted \"unilaterally\" or in \"agreement\" with employers. A union can never achieve substantial benefits for its members through unilateral action; I should have thought that the unsuccessful history of the Industrial Workers of the World, which eschewed collective bargaining and espoused a philosophy of winning benefits by unilateral action, proved this beyond question. See Dulles, Labor in America 208-223 (1949); Chaplin, Wobbly (1948). Furthermore, I cannot believe that Congress, by adopting the antitrust laws, put its stamp of approval on this discredited IWW philosophy of industrial relations; rather, in the Clayton Act and the labor statutes, Congress has \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 722]\n\u00a0\n repudiated such a philosophy. Our national labor policy is designed to encourage the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes through the negotiation of agreements between employers and unions. Unions cannot, as the history of the IWW shows, successfully retain employee benefits by unilateral action; nor can employers be assured of continuous operation without contractual safeguards. The history of labor relations in this country shows, as Congress has recognized, that progress and stability for both employers and employees can be achieved only through collective bargaining agreements involving mutual rights and responsibilities.\n\nThis history also shows that labor contracts establishing more or less standardized wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment in a given industry or market area are often secured either through bargaining with multi-employer associations or through bargaining with market leaders that sets a \"pattern\" for agreements on labor standards with other employers. These are two similar systems used to achieve the identical result of fostering labor peace through the negotiation of uniform labor standards in an industry. Yet the Court makes antitrust liability for both unions and employers turn on which of these two systems is used. It states that uniform wage agreements may be made with multi-employer units but an agreement cannot be made to affect employers outside the formal bargaining unit. I do not believe that the Court understands the effect of its ruling in terms of the practical realities of the automobile, steel, rubber, shipbuilding, and numerous other industries which follow the policy of pattern collective bargaining. See Chamberlain, Collective Bargaining 259-263 (1951); note 20, supra. I also do not understand why antitrust liability should turn on the form of unit determination rather than the substance of the collective bargaining impact on the industry. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 723]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, it seems clear that the essential error at the core of the Court's reasoning is that it ignores the express command of Congress that \"[t]he labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce,\"\n24\n and therefore that the antitrust laws do not prohibit the \"elimination of price competition based on differences in labor standards.\" Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, at 503. This is made clear by a simple question that the Court does not face. Where there is an \"agreement\" to seek uniform wages in an industry, in what item is competition restrained? The answer to this question can only be that competition is restrained in employee wage standards. That is, the union has agreed to restrain the free competitive market for labor by refusing to provide labor to other employers below the uniform rate. Under such an analysis, it would seem to follow that the existence of a union itself constitutes a restraint of trade, for the object of a union is to band together the individual workers in an effort, by common action, to obtain better wages and working conditions - i. e., to obtain a higher price for their labor. The very purpose and effect of a labor union is to limit the power of an employer to use competition among workingmen to drive down wage rates and enforce substandard conditions of employment. If competition between workingmen to see who will work for the lowest wage is the ideal, all labor unions should be eliminated. Indeed the Court itself apparently realizes that its holding that the antitrust laws are violated when a labor union agrees with employers not to compete on wages is premised on the belief that labor is a commodity and that this premise leads to the logical conclusion that unions themselves restrain trade in this commodity. This is the only reason I can imagine for the Court's felt need, in 1965, to assert that \"[t]he antitrust laws do not \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 724]\n\u00a0\n bar the existence and operation of labor unions as such.\" Pennington, ante, at 661. (Emphasis added.)\n\nAs I have already discussed, however, if one thing is clear, it is that Congress has repudiated the view that labor is a commodity and thus there should be competition to see who can supply it at the cheapest price. See pp. 710-713, supra. The kind of competition which is suppressed by employer-union agreement on uniform wages can only be competition between unions to see which union will agree to supply labor at a lower rate, or competition between employers in the sale of their products based on differences in labor costs. Neither type of \"suppression,\" I submit, can be supported as a restraint of trade condemned by the antitrust laws. No one, I think, believes that Congress intended that there be an economic system under which unions would compete with each other to supply labor at the lowest possible cost. It is equally clear that Congress did not intend that competition among manufacturers should be carried on, not on the basis of their relative efficiency or ability to produce what the consumer demands, but on their ability to operate at substandard wage rates. One of the important social advantages of competition mandated by the antitrust laws is that it rewards the most efficient producer and thus ensures the optimum use of our economic resources. This result, as Congress recognized, is not achieved by creating a situation in which manufacturers compete on the basis of who pays the lowest wages. As this Court stated in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, at 503-504, the \"elimination of price competition based on differences in labor standards is the objective of any national labor organization. But this effect on competition has not been considered to be the kind of curtailment of price competition prohibited by the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe assumption running through the Court's opinion in Pennington, as well as the opinion of my Brother DOUGLAS, is that giving full scope to the congressional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 725]\n\u00a0\n exemption of labor unions from the antitrust laws will operate to the advantage of large employers and big unions to the prejudice of small employers. Although I cannot see how that should affect the result reached on the basis of congressional intent even if the assumption were true, see Hunt v. Crumboch, \n325 \nU.S. 821, 825\n, n. 1, I feel compelled to note that this assumption is not accurate and is belied by the actualities of industrial relations. Experience in this area shows that frequently unions first organize the small and weak employers. These small employers are understandably afraid that unless other, larger employers are also organized, effective competition will be impossible. They will thus often seek to have the union attempt to organize and bargain for similar labor standards with their larger competitors so that the requirement to pay high union wages will not force the small businessmen to close down their enterprises.\n\nThe Court's holding in Pennington today flies in the face of Apex and Hutcheson and restrains collective bargaining in the same way as did the holding of the majority in Duplex - a holding which Congress has expressly repudiated in favor of Mr. Justice Brandeis' dissenting views. It represents contemporary manifestations of the reluctance of judges to give full effect to congressional purpose in this area and the substitution of judges' views for those of Congress as to how free collective bargaining should operate.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 726]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe judicial expressions in Jewel Tea represent another example of the reluctance of judges to give full effect to congressional purpose in this area and the substitution by judges of their views for those of Congress as to how free collective bargaining should operate. In this case the Court of Appeals would have held the Union subject to the Sherman Act's criminal and civil penalties because in the court's social and economic judgment, the determination of the hours at which meat is to be sold is a \"proprietary\" matter within the exclusive control of management and thus the Union had no legitimate interest in bargaining over it. My Brother DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK, would affirm this judgment apparently because the agreement was reached through a multi-employer bargaining unit. But, as I have demonstrated above, there is nothing even remotely illegal about such bargaining. Even if an independent conspiracy test were applicable to the Jewel Tea situation, the simple fact is that multi-employer bargaining conducted at arm's length does not constitute union abetment of a business combination. It is often a self-defensive form of employer bargaining designed to match union strength. See Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, supra; Labor Board v. Brown, supra. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 727]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMy Brother WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, while not agreeing with my Brother DOUGLAS, would reverse the Court of Appeals. He also, however, refuses to give full effect to the congressional intent that judges should not, under cover of the Sherman Act umbrella, substitute their economic and social policies for free collective bargaining. My Brother WHITE recognizes that the issue of the hours of sale of meat concerns a mandatory subject of bargaining based on the trial court's findings that it directly affected the hours of work of the butchers in the self-service markets, and therefore, since there was a finding that the Union was not abetting an independent employer conspiracy, he joins in reversing the Court of Appeals. In doing so, however, he apparently draws lines among mandatory subjects of bargaining, presumably based on a judicial determination of their importance to the worker, and states that not all agreements resulting from collective bargaining based on mandatory subjects of bargaining are immune from the antitrust laws, even absent evidence of union abetment of an independent conspiracy of employers. Following this reasoning, my Brother WHITE indicates that he would sustain a judgment here, even absent evidence of union abetment of an independent conspiracy of employers, if the trial court had found \"that self-service markets could actually operate without butchers, at least for a few hours after 6 p. m., that no encroachment on butchers' work would result and that the work load of butchers during normal working hours would not be substantially increased . . . .\" Ante, at 692. Such a view seems to me to be unsupportable. It represents a narrow, confining view of what labor unions have a legitimate interest in preserving and thus bargaining about. Even if the self-service markets could operate after 6 p. m., without their butchers and without increasing the work of their butchers \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 728]\n\u00a0\n at other times, the result of such operation can reasonably be expected to be either that the small, independent service markets would have to remain open in order to compete, thus requiring their union butchers to work at night, or that the small, independent service markets would not be able to operate at night and thus would be put at a competitive disadvantage.\n26\n Since it is clear that the large, automated self-service markets employ fewer butchers per volume of sales than service markets do, the Union certainly has a legitimate interest in keeping service markets competitive so as to preserve jobs. Job security of this kind has been recognized to be a legitimate subject of union interest. See Telegraphers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., \n362 \nU.S. 330\n; Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283, 362\n U.S. 605; United States v. Hod Carriers, \n313 \nU.S. 539\n, affirming United States v. Carrozzo, 37 F. Supp. 191 (D.C. N. D. Ill.); United States v. American Federation of Musicians, \n318 \nU.S. 741\n, affirming 47 F. Supp. 304 (D.C. N. D. Ill.); Window Glass Mfrs. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 403\n; cf. Teamsters Union v. Hanke, \n339 \nU.S. 470, 475\n (opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter); see also California Sportswear & Dress Assn., Inc., 54 F. T. C. 835. As I have previously stated: \"To believe that labor union interests may not properly extend beyond mere direct job and wage competition is to ignore not only economic and social realities so obvious as not to need mention, but also the graphic lessons of American labor union history.\" Los Angeles Meat & Provision Drivers Union v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 94, 103\n, 104 (concurring opinion). The direct interest of the union in not working undesirable hours by curtailing all business at those hours is, of course, a far cry from the indirect \"interest\" in Allen \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 729]\n\u00a0\n Bradley in fixing prices and allocating markets solely to increase the profits of favored employers.\n\nIndeed, if the Union in Jewel Tea were attempting to aid the small service butcher shops and thus save total employment against automation, perhaps at a necessarily reduced wage scale, the case would present the exact opposite union philosophy from that of the Mine Workers in Pennington. Putting the opinion of the Court in Pennington together with the opinions of my Brothers DOUGLAS and WHITE in Jewel Tea, it would seem that unions are damned if their collective bargaining philosophy involves acceptance of automation (Pennington) and are equally damned if their collective bargaining philosophy involves resistance to automation (Jewel Tea). Again, the wisdom of a union adopting either philosophy is not for judicial determination. This Court recently stated that \"we emphatically refuse to go back to the time when courts used the Due Process Clause `to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.'\" Ferguson v. Skrupa, \n372 \nU.S. 726, 731\n-732. I likewise see no reason why this Court should go back to the time when judges determined \"according to their own economic and social views whether the damage inflicted on an employer in an industrial struggle was damnum absque injuria, because an incident of trade competition, or a legal injury, because in their opinion, economically and socially objectionable.\" Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, at 486 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis).\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nMoreover, while these cases involve suits against unions, we should not overlook the fact that if unions are held liable under the antitrust laws for collective bargaining activities concerning mandatory subjects, then \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 730]\n\u00a0\n the employer parties to this mandatory collective bargaining would also be subject to antitrust penalties, criminal and civil. It would seem the height of unfairness so to penalize employers for the discharge of their statutory duty to bargain on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which duty, this Court has held, requires the employer to enter into a signed contract with the union embodying the collective bargaining terms agreed upon. See H. J. Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514\n. The unfairness to employers of this situation is aptly illustrated by the record facts of Pennington. From 1930 until the formation of the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association and the negotiation of a uniform wage agreement between the Association and the union in 1950, bargaining in the coal industry was highlighted by bitter and protracted negotiations. Costly strikes were a recurring phenomenon and government seizure of the mines was characteristic of most of the period. Unfair labor practice charges were often exchanged and lawsuits resulting from bargaining differences were on court dockets continuously. In 1934, 400,000 miners struck for one week. In 1939, a five-week strike ended only after presidential intervention. In 1941, the union struck southern mines after those operators withdrew from negotiations in which the union was seeking to eliminate a regional wage differential. Shortly thereafter the union struck the so-called \"captive\" mines (mines which produce coal to be used in the processing of other products, mainly steel). One hundred thousand other miners struck in sympathy with the captive mine employees. During negotiations in 1943, there were a number of strikes over a six-month period and the Government twice seized the struck mines. Similarly in 1945 a number of strikes following a breakdown in negotiations resulted in government seizure of 235 mines. When the Government seized the mines once again in 1946 because \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 731]\n\u00a0\n of a breakdown in negotiations over a welfare fund, a settlement was reached only through the active intervention of the Secretary of the Interior, who himself negotiated the beginning of the program of welfare fund benefits.\n\nIt was the opinion of many employers and neutral observers of the scene that these chaotic collective bargaining conditions were a result, at least in part, of the disorganized bargaining on the employer side. With each new effort at negotiations the operators had attempted to form a committee with various subcommittees to receive and present bargaining proposals. There was, however, no permanent organization to unify the operators' bargaining position and thereby to attempt to maintain peaceful and stable labor relations. The amorphous and ad hoc nature of the employers' bargaining organization was felt to have subjected the operators to whipsawing by the union and thus impaired serious, good faith and business-like bargaining. It was to try to correct this situation that the Association was formed. The Association is open to any coal operator who wishes to participate in the negotiations through it. Since this change in 1950, collective bargaining has been, to a marked degree, stabilized in the industry. There have been no governmental seizures or nation-wide strikes. Collective bargaining problems have not ended as a matter of course in Labor Board or court proceedings, or in governmental seizure or other intervention. While the negotiations have not always been easy and many difficult issues have arisen, the procedure for solving them has gone from the earlier jungle-type economic warfare to the reasoned and rational process of the conference table. I cannot believe that Congress, which has manifested a clear general purpose of promoting labor peace and stability, and, in particular, has a long history of attention to collective bargaining \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 732]\n\u00a0\n in coal,\n27\n one of our basic industries, intended that, these employer efforts to perfect a solid front in bargaining with the miners' union should have the effect of subjecting the employers, as well as the union, to the penalties of the antitrust laws. To apply the antitrust laws at this late date to such activities would endanger the stability which now characterizes collective bargaining in the coal industry and other basic industries with similar collective bargaining histories. It is in recognition of this fact that Congress has on a number of occasions refused to enact legislation that would curtail industry-wide bargaining\n28\n or would make the antitrust laws generally applicable to collective bargaining activity.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nMy view that Congress intended that collective bargaining activity on mandatory subjects of bargaining under the Labor Act not be subject to the antitrust laws does not mean that I believe that Congress intended that activity involving all non mandatory subjects of bargaining be similarly exempt. The direct and overriding interest of unions in such subjects as wages, hours, and other working conditions, which Congress has recognized in making them subjects of mandatory bargaining, is clearly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 733]\n\u00a0\n lacking where the subject of the agreement is price-fixing and market allocation. Moreover, such activities are at the core of the type of anti competitive commercial restraint at which the antitrust laws are directed.\n\nNor does my view mean that where a union operates as a businessman, exercising a proprietary or ownership function, it is beyond the reach of the antitrust laws merely because it is a union. On the contrary, the labor exemption is inapplicable where the union acts not as a union but as an entrepreneur. See, e. g., Streiffer v. Seafarers Sea Chest Corp., 162 F. Supp. 602 (D.C. E. D. La.); United States v. Seafarers Sea Chest Corp., 1956 CCH Trade Cases \u00a7 68,298 (D.C. E. D. N. Y.). Therefore, if a union is found by sufficient evidence and under proper instructions to have participated as a proprietor in actions violative of the antitrust laws, it is no more shielded from antitrust sanctions than any other business participant.\n\nIn Pennington, there were allegations that a part of the conspiracy of the large coal operators consisted of collusive bidding on the TVA spot market of West Kentucky Coal Company, Nashville Coal Company, and two other coal operators, for which the Union allegedly shared responsibility. It was asserted that the effect of this alleged collusive bidding was to drive down the prices on the spot market and thereby injure the small coal operators. Although the Court of Appeals apparently accepted this position, it did not deal directly with the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to show the Union's participation in the alleged scheme. Rather, the Court of Appeals relied upon the fact that the Union was a major stockholder in West Kentucky and had substantial interests in Nashville. It examined the origin and growth of the union interest in these two companies and concluded: \"It was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude from these facts that it was the purpose of the UMW to have a very material voice, if not the dominant \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 734]\n\u00a0\n one, in determining the policies and operations of these two major coal companies, which, as is hereinafter pointed out are charged with playing an important role in the alleged conspiracy.\" 325 F.2d 804, 814. This, it appears, is as near as the Court of Appeals came to passing upon the sufficiency of the evidence connecting the Union with the alleged collusive spot market bidding and in effect is a holding that the ownership of a controlling or substantial interest in a company which violates the antitrust laws subjects the owner of that interest to personal antitrust liability. In my view, this is clearly not the law. The ownership of a controlling or substantial interest in a company which conspires with others in violation of the antitrust laws does not in itself impose antitrust liability on the owner. Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 386, 403\n; Buckeye Powder Co. v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours P. Co., 223 F. 881, 885-886 (C. A. 3d Cir.), aff'd on other grounds, \n248 \nU.S. 55\n; Union Pacific Coal Co. v. United States, 173 F. 737 (C. A. 8th Cir.). Rather the owner must be shown to have participated knowingly and actively in the alleged illegal activity. See United States v. Wise, \n370 \nU.S. 405, 416\n. Cf. Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 299\n-305; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 393\n-396.\n\nMoreover, the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on this issue. It correctly instructed the jury that union ownership of a coal company did not violate the law. However, it erroneously refused to instruct the jury that the Union's financial stake in the two coal companies did not of itself show participation in an illegal conspiracy, if there was one, and that the Union must have been shown to have participated through being party to an overall plan which included the spot-market bidding or through its participation in the particular practices complained \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 735]\n\u00a0\n of. Thus it is clear that the judgment against the Union cannot stand on the basis of this part of the case.\n\nFinally, my conclusion that unions and employers are exempt from the operations of the antitrust laws for activities involving subjects of mandatory bargaining is based solely on congressional statutes which I believe clearly grant such an exemption and not on any views past or present as to the economic desirability of such an exemption. Whether it is wise or sound public policy for this exemption to continue to exist in its present form, or at all, or whether the exemption gives too much power to labor organizations, is solely for Congress to determine. The problem of the application of the antitrust laws to collective bargaining is but another aspect of the question of whether it is sound public policy to recognize or to limit the \"right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest.\" Duplex Co. v. Deering, supra, at 488 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis).\n\nOn this issue I am in agreement with the Court in Hunt v. Crumboch, supra, at 825, n. 1: \"That which Congress has recognized as lawful, this Court has no constitutional power to declare unlawful, by arguing that Congress has accorded too much power to labor organizations.\"\n\nFor the reasons expressed above, I dissent from the opinion of the Court but concur in the reversal of the Court of Appeals in Pennington, and concur in the judgment of the Court in Jewel Tea.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For these policies, John L. Lewis, the long-time head of the Mine Workers, has been variously condemned and praised. See, e. g., \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 699]\n\u00a0\n Baratz, op. cit. supra, at 138-151; Folliard, op. cit. supra; Alinsky, John L. Lewis 346-372 (1949); Wechsler, Labor Baron: A Portrait of John L. Lewis (1944). Among the praise has been a Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded on September 14, 1964, in which Mr. Lewis was cited as follows: \"Eloquent spokesman of labor, he has given voice to the aspirations of the industrial workers of the country and led the cause of free trade unions within a healthy system of free enterprise.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The legislative history is well summarized in Berman, Labor and the Sherman Act 3-54 (1930). See also Frankfurter & Greene, The Labor Injunction 139, n. 17 (1930).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] One of the expressed aims of the Act appears to have been approval of such union-employer agreements as \"the protocol in the sweated industries of New York City and vicinity which abolished sweatshops and long hours of labor, and the burdensome, miserable toil prevailing, and established the combination of employers and of work men and work women by which certain standards are to be enforced, and [which provided that] no employer can become a member of the manufacturers' association in that trade unless he is willing to undersigned an agreement by which the conditions prevailing in the protocol will be inaugurated by him.\" H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 15; S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 11. This quotation was a part of the statement of Samuel Gompers to the House Committee in which he argued for adoption of a labor exemption to the Sherman Act. He stated his fear that while he did not believe \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 702]\n\u00a0\n that courts would declare the existence of labor unions per se to be violations of the Sherman Act, he believed that such protocols as the one discussed above would be held unlawful and stated that the manufacturers' association involved had already been sued. He was therefore seeking a congressional enactment declaring such a protocol lawful both for labor and business. It is significant that in both Senate and House Reports, almost the entire discussion of 6 of the Clayton Act consists of this extract from Mr. Gompers' testimony. The inference is inescapable that the Clayton Act was designed, inter alia, to immunize such protocols from antitrust liability.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] As the House Committee stated in reporting out the Norris-LaGuardia Act, \"[t]he purpose of the bill is to protect the rights of labor in the same manner the Congress intended when it enacted the Clayton Act, October 15, 1914 (38 Stat. L., 738), which act, by reason \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 704]\n\u00a0\n of its construction and application by the Federal courts, is ineffectual to accomplish the congressional intent.\" H. R. Rep. No. 669, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 3; see also id., at 7-8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In reaching this conclusion the Court relied, in part, on the provision of 6 of the Clayton Act that \"the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce . . . nor shall such [labor] organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in the restraint of trade under the antitrust laws.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 503\n. It also relied on provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1185, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq. (1958 ed.), the National Labor Relations Act, the Walsh-Healey Act, 49 Stat. 2036, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 35-45 (1958 ed.), and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 201-219 (1958 ed.). Its conclusion was that \"[t]his series of acts clearly recognizes that combinations of workers eliminating competition among themselves and restricting competition among their employers based on wage cutting are not contrary to the public policy.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 504\n, n. 24.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Court clarified this statement by citation to United States v. Brims, \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, a case involving an employer conspiracy to allocate markets. See Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters Assn., \n274 \nU.S. 37, 56\n, 64 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis). This, of course, is quite similar to the situation presented in Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n. It is far different from the situations in the cases decided today and the situation in the garment industry which was specifically approved by Congress in the Clayton Act. See note 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf. the opinion of my Brother WHITE in Jewel Tea, ante, at 688-689, 692-693; infra, pp. 727-729, United States v. Brims, \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, discussed in note 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See, e. g., H. R. 3020 301 (a), (b), 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 22; H. R. Conf. Rep.

J. 957 (1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] As this case does not involve an Allen Bradley situation, it is not necessary to determine whether Congress, in enacting these Taft-Hartley boycott and related revisions to the Act and at the same time rejecting an attempted codification of the Allen Bradley doctrine in the antitrust laws, intended that all union activities in this area be covered solely under the comprehensive regulation of the labor statutes with their restricted injunctive and damage provisions. See sources cited in note 8, supra. Cf. Teamsters Union v. Lester Morton Trucking Co., \n377 \nU.S. 252\n; Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n; Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] As an antitrust issue, see United States v. Hutcheson, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] As an antitrust issue, see United States v.

Building & Construction Trades Council, \n313 \nU.S. 539\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] In Pennington the collective bargaining agreement restricted subleasing, which is a mining form of subcontracting. Indeed, the Pennington case bristles with potential unfair labor practices. The Mine Workers allegedly imposed the national wage agreement on the small coal operators at a time when the Union did not represent their employees. For a minority union to enter into a collective bargaining contract covering all the employees of a unit has been held to infringe the rights of employees under 7 of the NLRA. Garment Workers v. Labor Board, \n366 \nU.S. 731\n. A \"protective wage clause\" in the national wage agreement provided that signatory companies would not buy coal mined under terms and conditions less favorable than \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 709]\n\u00a0\n those in the national wage agreement. The Labor Board has held that this type of clause violates 8 (e) of the NLRA, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158 (e) (1958 ed., Supp. V). See Raymond O. Lewis, W. A. Boyle & John Owens, etc., 144 N. L. R. B. 228. See also Raymond O. Lewis et al., 148 N. L. R. B. ___, 1964 CCH, N. L. R. B. Decisions \u00a7 13,334.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See pp. 700-701, supra; Apex Hosiery Co. v.

Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n; Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 490\n-491. Although Allen Bradley held that the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts precluded federal courts from enjoining activities concerned with even some nonmandatory subjects of bargaining, Congress has since provided that union insistence on bargaining over nonmandatory subjects is an unfair labor practice, cf. Labor Board v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp., \n356 \nU.S. 342\n, and thus the Labor Board can order the union to cease and desist from such insistence as well as from auxiliary conduct like strikes designed to effectuate it; see Local 164, Brotherhood of Painters v. Labor Board, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 294, 293 F.2d 133.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Today, between 80% and 100% of the workers under union agreement are covered by multi-employer contracts in such important industries as men's and women's clothing, coal mining, building construction, hotel, longshoring, maritime, trucking, and warehousing Between 60% and 80% of unionized workers are under multi-employer pacts in baking, book and job printing, canning and preserving, textile dyeing and finishing, glass and glassware, malt liquor, pottery and retail trades. See Reynolds, Labor Economics and Labor Relations 170 (3d ed. 1959). Furthermore, in some other major industries relatively uniform terms of employment are obtained through the negotiation of a contract with one leading employer and the subsequent acceptance of that contract's key provisions, with only minor modifications by the other employers in the industry. See Chamberlain, Collective Bargaining 259-263 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Section 6 of the Clayton Act. See p. 701, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] See, e. g., Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295\n (union primary strike activities in an organizational campaign enjoined on the grounds that the \"purpose\" of the organizational campaign was to prevent nonunion coal from undercutting union coal): United States v. Railway Employees' Dept., 283 F. 479 (D.C. N. D. Ill.) (primary strike against railroad held invalid on the ground that it interrupted commerce); Bedford Co. v. Stone Cutters Assn., \n274 \nU.S. 37\n (union's unilateral refusal to work on nonunion goods held invalid).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] See Exec. Orders Nos. 9250 and 9328, 7 Fed. Reg. 7871, 8 Fed. Reg. 4681, promulgated pursuant to the Act of October 2, 1942, 56 Stat. 765.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Section 6 of the Clayton Act. See p. 701, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The Court in Pennington states that it \"cannot conclude that the national labor policy provides any support\" for agreements whereby unions undertake to attempt to obtain uniform terms from other employers in the industry. Pennington, ante, at 667. In making this statement the Court ignores clear congressional expressions in 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, the Davis-Bacon Act, and the express purpose of the National Labor Relations Act. See generally, pp. 709-713, supra. Moreover, the Court's reliance on three old Labor Board cases for its conclusions is clearly misplaced. These cases hold, at most, as the Court itself recognizes, that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 726]\n\u00a0\n an employer may not refuse to recognize a union chosen by his employees or refuse to sign any contract until such time as the union has successfully organized the employer's competitors. Such situations, of course, are completely different from the situation in which an employer with established collective bargaining relations voluntarily agrees with the union that the union will attempt to have other employers accept similar or uniform terms. They also are completely different from the situation in which an employer signs a collective bargaining agreement the terms of which contain a \"most favored nation\" clause, or labor standards on a sliding scale adjusted to the average or some other prevailing wage standard.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] It is clear that the small service butcher shops cannot operate at night without butchers on duty. There is no doubt that the Union could bargain with them as to the hours its members worked.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] See, e. g., Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 1417, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; Hearings before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 4668, 74th Cong., 2d Sess.; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 1, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor, Welfare of Miners, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on S.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK concur, dissenting.\n\nIf we followed Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n,\n*\n we would hold with the Court of Appeals that this \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 736]\n\u00a0\n multi-employer agreement with the union not to sell meat between 6 p. m. and 9 a. m. was not immunized from the antitrust laws and that respondent's evidence made out a prima facie case that it was in fact a violation of the Sherman Act.\n\nIf, in the present case, the employers alone agreed not to sell meat from 6 p. m. to 9 a. m., they would be guilty of an anticompetitive practice, barred by the antitrust laws. Absent an agreement or conspiracy, a proprietor can keep his establishment open for such hours as he chooses. Cf. Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 263\n. My Brother WHITE recognizes, as he must, that the agreement in this case has an \"effect on competition [that] is apparent and real\" and that it is an \"obvious restraint on the product market,\" ante, pp. 691 and 692. That Jewel has been coerced by the unions into respecting this agreement means that Jewel cannot use convenience of shopping hours as a means of competition. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, 331 F.2d, at 550, there is nothing procompetitive about this agreement. Cf. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231\n.\n\nAt the conclusion of respondent's case, the District Court dismissed Associated and Bromann from the action, which was tried without a jury, on the ground that there was no evidence of a conspiracy between Associated and the unions. But in the circumstances of this case the collective bargaining agreement itself, of which the District Court said there was clear proof, was evidence of a conspiracy among the employers with the unions to impose the marketing-hours restriction on Jewel via a strike threat by the unions. This tended to take from the merchants who agreed among themselves their freedom to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 737]\n\u00a0\n work their own hours and to subject all who, like Jewel wanted to sell meat after 6 p. m. to the coercion of threatened strikes, all of which if done in concert only by businessmen would violate the antitrust laws. See Fashion Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 465\n.\n\nIn saying that there was no conspiracy, the District Court failed to give any weight to the collective bargaining agreement itself as evidence of a conspiracy and to the context in which it was written. This Court makes the same mistake. We said in Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, supra, at 808, \". . . we think Congress never intended that unions could, consistently with the Sherman Act, aid non-labor groups to create business monopolies and to control the marketing of goods and services.\" Here the contract of the unions with a large number of employers shows it was planned and designed not merely to control but entirely to prohibit \"the marketing of goods and services\" from 6 p. m. until 9 a. m. the next day. Some merchants relied chiefly on price competition to draw trade; others employed courtesy, quick service, and keeping their doors open long hours to meet the convenience of customers. The unions here induced a large group of merchants to use their collective strength to hurt others who wanted the competitive advantage of selling meat after 6 p. m. Unless Allen Bradley is either overruled or greatly impaired, the unions can no more aid a group of businessmen to force their competitors to follow uniform store marketing hours than to force them to sell at fixed prices. Both practices take away the freedom of traders to carry on their business in their own competitive fashion.\n\nMy Brother WHITE's conclusion that the concern of the union members over marketing hours is \"immediate and direct\" depends upon there being a necessary connection between marketing hours and working hours. That connection is found in the District Court's finding that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 676, 738]\n\u00a0\n \"in stores where meat is sold at night it is impractical to operate without either butchers or other employees.\" 215 F. Supp. 839, 846. It is, however, undisputed that on some nights Jewel does so operate in some of its stores in Indiana, and even in Chicago it sometimes operates without butchers at night in the sale of fresh poultry and sausage, which are exempt from the union ban.\n\nIt is said that even if night self-service could be carried on without butchers, still the union interest in store hours would be immediate and direct because competitors would have to stay open too or be put at a disadvantage - and some of these competitors would be non-self-service stores that would have to employ union butchers at night. But Allen Bradley forecloses such an expansive view of the labor exemption to the antitrust laws.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The Allen Bradley decision has been reaffirmed and approved by the Court on numerous occasions.

That court found that the state statute creating support liability \"violates the basic constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the law . . . .\" Held: Since the California court did not specify whether its holding was based on the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution or the equivalent provision of the state constitution, or both, this Court cannot be certain that the judgment below was not based on an adequate and independent nonfederal ground. In light of the doubt as to this Court's jurisdiction, the judgment is vacated and the case remanded. Pp. 195-201.\n\n 60 Cal. 2d 716, 388 P.2d 720, judgment vacated and case remanded.\n\nElizabeth Palmer, Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General of California, Harold B. Haas, Assistant Attorney General, and John Carl Porter and Asher Rubin, Deputy Attorneys General.\n\nAlan A.

Fischman for the National Association for Retarded Children, Inc., and the American Orthopsychiatric Association.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nMrs. Auguste Schaeche was adjudged incompetent in 1953 and committed to a California state mental institution operated by petitioner. California Welfare and Institutions Code 6650 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"The husband, wife, father, mother, or children of a mentally ill person or inebriate, and the administrators of their estates, and the estate of such mentally ill person or inebriate, shall be liable for his care, support, and maintenance in a state institution of which he is an inmate. The liability of such persons and estates shall be a joint and several liability . . . .\"\n\n\n Ellinor Vance, the daughter of Mrs. Schaeche, died in 1960 and respondent was appointed administratrix of her estate. Petitioner filed a claim for $7,554.22 with respondent, that being the cost of support furnished to the incompetent from 1956 to 1960, which was rejected by respondent. Petitioner then filed suit for that amount and obtained judgment on the pleadings. The District \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeal affirmed, 29 Cal. Rptr. 312, but the Supreme Court of California reversed, finding that 6650 \"violates the basic constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the law . . . .\" 60 Cal. 2d 716, 717, 388 P.2d 720. We granted certiorari to consider the important questions involved, \n379 \nU.S. 811\n. After plenary briefing and argument, however, we are unable to say with requisite assurance that this Court has jurisdiction in the premises.\n\nThe California Supreme Court did not state whether its holding was based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or the equivalent provisions of the California Constitution,\n1\n or both. While we might speculate from the choice of words used in the opinion, and the authorities cited by the court, which provision was the basis for the judgment of the state court, we are unable to say with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n any degree of certainty that the judgment of the California Supreme Court was not based on an adequate and independent nonfederal ground. This Court is always wary of assuming jurisdiction of a case from a state court unless it is plain that a federal question is necessarily presented, and the party seeking review here must show that we have jurisdiction of the case.\n2\n Were we to assume that the federal question was the basis for the decision below, it is clear that the California Supreme Court, either on remand or in another case presenting the same issues, could inform us that its opinion was in fact based, at least in part, on the California Constitution, thus leaving the result untouched by whatever conclusions this Court might have reached on the merits of the federal question. For reasons that follow we conclude that further clarifying proceedings in the California Supreme Court are called for under the principles stated in Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551\n.\n\nThe first mention of any specific constitutional provision in this case appears to have been made in respondent's reply brief in the State District Court of Appeal, and it related solely to the State Constitution.\n3\n That court disposed of the constitutional claim in one paragraph,\n4\n citing Department of Mental Hygiene v. McGilvery, 50 Cal. 2d 742, 754-761, 329 P.2d 689, 695-699. In McGilvery rehearing was granted by the California Supreme Court to consider the claim that \"an absolute liability on a mother to pay for the care, support and maintenance of her mentally ill daughter in a state institution, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n is a deprivation of property without equal protection of law and without just compensation in violation of the state and federal Constitutions.\" 50 Cal. 2d, at 747, 329 P.2d, at 691. On the pages cited by the District Court of Appeal, the California Supreme Court in McGilvery had concluded:\n\n \"Article I, section 11 of the California Constitution requires that all laws of a general nature have a uniform operation. This has been held generally to require a reasonable classification of persons upon whom the law is to operate. The classification must be one that is founded upon some natural or intrinsic or constitutional distinction. [Citations.] Likewise, those within the class, that is those persons similarly situated with respect to that law, must be subjected to equal burdens. [Citation.] The clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution which prohibits a state from denying to `any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws' has been similarly construed.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n An examination of the opinion of the California Supreme Court in the case before us does not indicate whether that court relied on the State Constitution alone, the Federal Constitution alone, or both; and we would have jurisdiction to review only if the federal ground had been the sole basis for the decision, or the State Constitution was interpreted under what the state court deemed the compulsion of the Federal Constitution.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe court first discussed Department of Mental Hygiene v. Hawley, 59 Cal. 2d 247, 379 P.2d 22, a case decided under the Fourteenth Amendment, and then stated, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n \"This holding is dispositive of the issue before us.\" 60 Cal. 2d, at 720, 388 P.2d, at 722.\n\nThe court went on, however, to discuss other cases. After noting that in Department of Mental Hygiene v. Shane, 142 Cal. App. 2d 881, 299 P.2d 747 (relied on in McGilvery), there was no \"mention of either the United States or the California Constitutions,\" the court distinguished both Shane and McGilvery as cases in which the constitutional claims were not presented. 60 Cal. 2d. at 721, 388 P.2d, at 723. It then discussed Hoeper v. Tax Comm'n, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, which dealt with reasonable classification, and compared a similar treatment in Estate of Tetsubumi Yano, 188 Cal. 645, 656-657 14.. 206 P. 995. In Yano the California Supreme Court found an alien land law in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and of the California Constitution. The court's discussion of the Equal Protection Clause, however, was confined to pp. 654-656 of the opinion, and in headnote 14. on page 656 (cited by the court in the present case) the court dealt principally with the state constitutional ground.\n\nAfter examining the statutory framework of the support statutes, the court in this case finally concluded with the following statement:\n\n\"A statute obviously violates the equal protection clause if it selects one particular class of persons for a species of taxation and no rational basis supports such classification. (See Blumenthal v. Board of Medical Examiners (1962) 57 Cal. 2d 228, 237 13. [18 Cal. Rptr. 501, 368 P.2d 101]; Bilyeu v. State Employees' Retirement System (1962) 58 Cal. 2d 618, 623 2. [25 Cal. Rptr. 562, 375 P.2d 442].) Such a concept for the state's taking of a free man's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n property manifestly denies him equal protection of the law.\" 60 Cal. 2d, at 722-723, 388 P.2d, at 724.\n\n\n Blumenthal v. Board of Medical Examiners, 57 Cal. 2d 228, 368 P.2d 101, involved an attack on a licensing statute under both the Fourteenth Amendment and 11 and 21 of Article I of the California Constitution. See 57 Cal. 2d, at 232, 368 P.2d, at 103. The court did not specifically rely on one constitutional provision, but merely held the statute unconstitutional. Bilyeu v. State Employees' Retirement System, 58 Cal. 2d 618, 375 P.2d 442, involved an attack on a classification of state employees subject to retirement benefits. At headnote 2. of the opinion, cited by the court in Kirchner, appears the following language:\n\n\"There is no constitutional requirement of uniform treatment, but only that there be a reasonable basis for each classification.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n The use of such language suggests that the court may have been adverting to the California constitutional provision that \"[a]ll laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation.\" Calif. Const., Art. I, 11.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, it is clear that we cannot say with the requisite certainty that the California judgment rested solely on the Fourteenth Amendment, or, amounting to the same thing, that in striking the statute down under the State Constitution the court below acted under what it conceived to be the compulsion of the Federal Constitution (cf. Jankovich v. Indiana Toll Road Comm'n, \n379 \nU.S. 487, 492\n); one or the other determination would be necessary to our exercising jurisdiction. While the ambiguity of the opinion might normally lead us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, we think the preferable course is to leave the way \n\n[380 \nU.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n open for obtaining clarification from the California Supreme Court (Minnesota v. National Tea Co., supra), in view of the importance of and widespread interest in the case.\n8\n Unfortunately, because of California law, we cannot hold the case on our calendar until the parties submit a clarifying certificate from the California Supreme Court, see Dixon v. Duffy, \n344 \nU.S. 143, 145\n, but we can obviate undue delay by vacating the judgment of the California Supreme Court, directing that our mandate issue forthwith, and giving leave to the parties to file a new petition for certiorari incorporating by reference the record and briefs now on file in this Court, supplemented by such additional papers as may be necessary or appropriate, if on further proceedings the California Supreme Court holds that its judgment does not rest on an adequate independent nonfederal ground.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the cause remanded to that court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate under state law. The judgment and mandate of this Court shall issue forthwith.\n\n   Vacated and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, believing it clear that the Supreme Court of California did not rest solely on the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, would dismiss the writ.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] California Constitution, Art. I, 11, 21, provides in pertinent part: \"Sec. 11. All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation. .   .  .  .  . \"Sec. 21. No special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the Legislature: nor shall any citizen, or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.\" These provisions have been interpreted by the California courts as being the equivalent of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

PENNINGTON(1965)\nNo. 48\nArgued: January 27, 1965Decided: June 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The trustees of the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund sued respondents, partners in a coal mining company, for royalty payments under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1950, as amended. Respondents filed a cross claim for damages, alleging that the trustees, the UMW and certain large coal operators had conspired to restrain and monopolize commerce in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. It was alleged that, to eradicate overproduction in the coal industry, the UMW and large operators agreed to eliminate the smaller companies, by imposing the terms of the 1950 Agreement on all companies regardless of ability to pay, by increasing royalties due the welfare fund, by excluding the marketing, production and sale of nonunion coal, by refusing to lease coal lands to nonunion operators and refusing to buy or sell coal mined by such operators, by obtaining from the Secretary of Labor the establishment of a minimum wage under the Walsh-Healey Act higher than that in other industries, by urging TVA to curtail spot market purchases which were exempt from the Walsh-Healey order, and by waging a price-cutting campaign to drive small companies out of the spot market. Petitioner's motions to dismiss were denied and the jury returned a verdict against the trustees and the UMW. The trial court set aside the verdict against the trustees but overruled the union's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the union was not exempt from liability under the Sherman Act under the facts of the case. Held:\n\n 1. An agreement between the union and large operators to secure uniform labor standards throughout the industry would not be exempt from the antitrust laws. Pp. 661-669.\n\n\n (a) An agreement resulting from union-employer bargaining is not automatically exempt from Sherman Act scrutiny merely because the negotiations covered wage standards, or any other compulsory subject of bargaining. Pp. 664-665. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 658]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) A union may make wage agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit and may, in pursuance of its own self-interests, seek to obtain the same terms from other employers, but it forfeits its antitrust exemption when it agrees with a group of employers to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units and thus joins a conspiracy to curtail competition. Pp. 665-666.\n\n\n  (c) Nothing in the national labor policy indicates that a union and employers in one bargaining unit are free to bargain about wages or working conditions of other bargaining units or to settle these matters for the whole industry, nor does it allow an employer to condition the signing of an agreement on the union's imposition of a similar contract on his competitors. Pp. 666-667.\n\n\n  (d) Antitrust policy clearly restricts employer-union agreements seeking to set labor standards outside the bargaining unit, in view of the anticompetitive potential and the surrender by the union of its freedom of action with respect to bargaining policy. P. 668.\n\n\n 2. Concerted efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Eastern R. Conf. v. Noerr Motors, \n365 \nU.S. 127\n, followed. Pp. 669-672.\n\n\n  (a) Instructions to the jury that anticompetitive purpose could support an illegal conspiracy based solely on the Walsh-Healey and TVA episodes did not constitute merely harmless error. P. 670.\n\n\n  (b) Respondents were not entitled to damages under the Sherman Act for any injury suffered from the actions of the Secretary of Labor, and the jury should have been so instructed. Pp. 671-672.\n\n\n 325 F.2d 804, reversed and remanded.\n\nHarrison Combs argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were E. H. Rayson, R. R. Kramer and M. E. Boiarsky.\n\nJohn A.

St. Antoine argued the cause for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 659]\n\u00a0\n Organizations, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. With him on the brief were J. Albert Woll, Robert C. Mayer and Thomas E. Harris.\n\nGuy Farmer filed a brief for the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis action began as a suit by the trustees of the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund against the respondents, individually and as owners of Phillips Brothers Coal Company, a partnership, seeking to recover some $55,000 in royalty payments alleged to be due and payable under the trust provisions of the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1950, as amended, September 29, 1952, executed by Phillips and United Mine Workers of America on or about October 1, 1953, and re-executed with amendments on or about September 8, 1955, and October 22, 1956. Phillips filed an answer and a cross claim against UMW, alleging in both that the trustees, the UMW and certain large coal operators had conspired to restrain and to monopolize interstate commerce in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as amended, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2 (1958 ed.). Actual damages in the amount of $100,000 were claimed for the period beginning February 14, 1954, and ending December 31, 1958.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe allegations of the cross claim were essentially as follows: Prior to the 1950 Wage Agreement between the operators and the union, severe controversy had existed in the industry, particularly over wages, the welfare fund and the union's efforts to control the working time of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 660]\n\u00a0\n its members. Since 1950, however, relative peace has existed in the industry, all as the result of the 1950 Wage Agreement and its amendments and the additional understandings entered into between UMW and the large operators. Allegedly the parties considered overproduction to be the critical problem of the coal industry. The agreed solution was to be the elimination of the smaller companies, the larger companies thereby controlling the market. More specifically, the union abandoned its efforts to control the working time of the miners, agreed not to oppose the rapid mechanization of the mines which would substantially reduce mine employment, agreed to help finance such mechanization and agreed to impose the terms of the 1950 agreement on all operators without regard to their ability to pay. The benefit to the union was to be increased wages as productivity increased with mechanization, these increases to be demanded of the smaller companies whether mechanized or not. Royalty payments into the welfare fund were to be increased also, and the union was to have effective control over the fund's use. The union and large companies agreed upon other steps to exclude the marketing, production, and sale of nonunion coal. Thus the companies agreed not to lease coal lands to nonunion operators, and in 1958 agreed not to sell or buy coal from such companies. The companies and the union jointly and successfully approached the Secretary of Labor to obtain establishment under the Walsh-Healey Act, as amended, 49 Stat. 2036. 41 U.S.C. 35 et seq. (1958 ed.). of a minimum wage for employees of contractors selling coal to the TVA, such minimum wage being much higher than in other industries and making it difficult for small companies to compete in the TVA term contract market. At a later time, at a meeting attended by both union and company representatives, the TVA was urged to curtail its spot market purchases, a substantial portion of which \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 661]\n\u00a0\n were exempt from the Walsh-Healey order. Thereafter four of the larger companies waged a destructive and collusive price-cutting campaign in the TVA spot market for coal, two of the companies, West Kentucky Coal Co. and its subsidiary Nashville Coal Co., being those in which the union had large investments and over which it was in position to exercise control.\n\nThe complaint survived motions to dismiss and after a five-week trial before a jury, a verdict was returned in favor of Phillips and against the trustees and the union, the damages against the union being fixed in the amount of $90,000, to be trebled under 15 U.S.C. 15 (1958 ed.). The trial court set aside the verdict against the trustees but overruled the union's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 325 F.2d 804. It ruled that the union was not exempt from liability under the Sherman Act on the facts of this case, considered the instructions adequate and found the evidence generally sufficient to support the verdict. We granted certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 929\n. We reverse and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe first consider UMW's contention that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, since a determination in UMW's favor on this issue would finally resolve the controversy. The question presented by this phase of the case is whether in the circumstances of this case the union is exempt from liability under the antitrust laws. We think the answer is clearly in the negative and that the union's motions were correctly denied.\n\nThe antitrust laws do not bar the existence and operation of labor unions as such. Moreover, 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 738, and 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 662]\n\u00a0\n Act, 47 Stat. 70, permit a union, acting alone to engage in the conduct therein specified without violating the Sherman Act. United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n; United States v. International Hod Carriers Council, \n313 \nU.S. 539\n, affirming per curiam, 37 F. Supp. 191 (D.C. N. D. Ill. 1941); United States v. American Federation of Musicians, \n318 \nU.S. 741\n, affirming per curiam, 47 F. Supp. 304 (D.C. N. D. Ill. 1942).\n\nBut neither 20 nor 4 expressly deals with arrangements or agreements between unions and employers. Neither section tells us whether any or all such arrangements or agreements are barred or permitted by the antitrust laws. Thus Hutcheson itself stated:\n\n\"So long as a union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups, the licit and the illicit under 20 are not to be distinguished by any judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which the particular union activities are the means.\" \n312 \nU.S., at 232\n. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n And in Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n, this Court made explicit what had been merely a qualifying expression in Hutcheson and held that \"when the unions participated with a combination of business men who had complete power to eliminate all competition among themselves and to prevent all competition from others, a situation was created not included within the exemptions of the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts.\" Id., at 809. See also Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 395, 398\n-400; United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., \n347 \nU.S. 186, 190\n. Subsequent cases have applied the Allen Bradley doctrine to such combinations without regard to whether they found expression in a collective bargaining agreement, Brother-hood \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 663]\n\u00a0\n of Carpenters v. United States, supra; see Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283, 296\n, and even though the mechanism for effectuating the purpose of the combination was an agreement on wages, see Adams Dairy Co. v. St. Louis Dairy Co., 260 F.2d 46 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1958), or on hours of work, Philadelphia Record Co. v. Manufacturing Photo-Engravers Assn., 155 F.2d 799 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1946).\n\nIf the UMW in this case, in order to protect its wage scale by maintaining employer income, had presented a set of prices at which the mine operators would be required to sell their coal, the union and the employers who happened to agree could not successfully defend this contract provision if it were challenged under the antitrust laws by the United States or by some party injured by the arrangement. Cf. Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n; United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 203\n-205; Lumber Prods. Assn. v. United States, 144 F.2d 546, 548 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1944), aff'd on this issue sub nom. Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 395, 398\n-400; Las Vegas Merchant Plumbers Assn. v. United States, 210 F.2d 732 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, \n348 \nU.S. 817\n; Local 175, IBEW v. United States, 219 F.2d 431 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1955), cert. denied, \n349 \nU.S. 917\n. In such a case, the restraint on the product market is direct and immediate, is of the type characteristically deemed unreasonable under the Sherman Act and the union gets from the promise nothing more concrete than a hope for better wages to come.\n\nLikewise, if as is alleged in this case, the union became a party to a collusive bidding arrangement designed to drive Phillips and others from the TVA spot market, we think any claim to exemption from antitrust liability would be frivolous at best. For this reason alone the motions of the unions were properly denied. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 664]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA major part of Phillips' case, however, was that the union entered into a conspiracy with the large operators to impose the agreed-upon wage and royalty scales upon the smaller, nonunion operators, regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of whether or not the union represented the employees of these companies, all for the purpose of eliminating them from the industry, limiting production and pre-empting the market for the large, unionized operators. The UMW urges that since such an agreement concerned wage standards, it is exempt from the antitrust laws.\n\nIt is true that wages lie at the very heart of those subjects about which employers and unions must bargain and the law contemplates agreements on wages not only between individual employers and a union but agreements between the union and employers in a multi-employer bargaining unit. Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Union, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 94\n-96. The union benefit from the wage scale agreed upon is direct and concrete and the effect on the product market, though clearly present, results from the elimination of competition based on wages among the employers in the bargaining unit, which is not the kind of restraint Congress intended the Sherman Act to proscribe. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469, 503\n-504; see Adams Dairy Co. v. St. Louis Dairy Co., 260 F.2d 46 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1958). We think it beyond question that a union may conclude a wage agreement with the multi-employer bargaining unit without violating the antitrust laws and that it may as a matter of its own policy, and not by agreement with all or part of the employers of that unit, seek the same wages from other employers.\n\nThis is not to say that an agreement resulting from union-employer negotiations is automatically exempt from Sherman Act scrutiny simply because the negotiations involve a compulsory subject of bargaining, regardless \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 665]\n\u00a0\n of the subject or the form and content of the agreement. Unquestionably the Board's demarcation of the bounds of the duty to bargain has great relevance to any consideration of the sweep of labor's antitrust immunity, for we are concerned here with harmonizing the Sherman Act with the national policy expressed in the National Labor Relations Act of promoting \"the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by subjecting labor-management controversies to the mediatory influence of negotiation,\" Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. v. Labor Board, \n379 \nU.S. 203, 211\n. But there are limits to what a union or an employer may offer or extract in the name of wages, and because they must bargain does not mean that the agreement reached may disregard other laws. Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283, 296\n; Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 395, 399\n-400.\n\nWe have said that a union may make wage agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit and may in pursuance of its own union interests seek to obtain the same terms from other employers. No case under the antitrust laws could be made out on evidence limited to such union behavior.\n2\n But we think a union forfeits its exemption from the antitrust laws when it is clearly shown that it has agreed with one set of employers to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units. One group of employers may not conspire to eliminate competitors from \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 666]\n\u00a0\n the industry and the union is liable with the employers if it becomes a party to the conspiracy. This is true even though the union's part in the scheme is an undertaking to secure the same wages, hours or other conditions of employment from the remaining employers in the industry.\n\nWe do not find anything in the national labor policy that conflicts with this conclusion. This Court has recognized that a legitimate aim of any national labor organization is to obtain uniformity of labor standards and that a consequence of such union activity may be to eliminate competition based on differences in such standards. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469, 503\n. But there is nothing in the labor policy indicating that the union and the employers in one bargaining unit are free to bargain about the wages, hours and working conditions of other bargaining units or to attempt to settle these matters for the entire industry. On the contrary, the duty to bargain unit by unit leads to a quite different conclusion. The union's obligation to its members would seem best served if the union retained the ability to respond to each bargaining situation as the individual circumstances might warrant, without being strait-jacketed by some prior agreement with the favored employers.\n\nSo far as the employer is concerned it has long been the Board's view that an employer may not condition the signing of a collective bargaining agreement on the union's organization of a majority of the industry. American Range Lines, Inc., 13 N. L. R. B. 139, 147 (1939); Samuel Youlin, 22 N. L. R. B. 879, 885 (1940); Newton Chevrolet, Inc., 37 N. L. R. B. 334, 341 (1941); see Labor Board v. George P. Pilling & Son Co., 119 F.2d 32, 38 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1941). In such cases the obvious interest of the employer is to ensure that acceptance of the union's wage demands will not adversely affect his competitive position. In American Range Lines, Inc., supra, the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 667]\n\u00a0\n Board rejected that employer interest as a justification for the demand. \"[A]n employer cannot lawfully deny his employees the right to bargain collectively through their designated representative in an appropriate unit because he envisions competitive disadvantages accruing from such bargaining.\" 13 N. L. R. B., at 147. Such an employer condition, if upheld, would clearly reduce the extent of collective bargaining. Thus, in Newton Chevrolet Inc., supra, where it was held a refusal to bargain for the employer to insist on a provision that the agreed contract terms would not become effective until five competitors had signed substantially similar contracts, the Board stated that \"[t]here is nothing in the Act to justify the imposition of a duty upon an exclusive bargaining representative to secure an agreement from a majority of an employer's competitors as a condition precedent to the negotiation of an agreement with the employer. To permit individual employers to refuse to bargain collectively until some or all of their competitors had done so clearly would lead to frustration of the fundamental purpose of the Act to encourage the practice of collective bargaining.\" 37 N. L. R. B., at 341. Permitting insistence on an agreement by the union to attempt to impose a similar contract on other employers would likewise seem to impose a restraining influence on the extent of collective bargaining, for the union could avoid an impasse only by surrendering its freedom to act in its own interest vis-a-vis other employers, something it will be unwilling to do in many instances. Once again, the employer's interest is a competitive interest rather than an interest in regulating its own labor relations, and the effect on the union of such an agreement would be to limit the free exercise of the employees' right to engage in concerted activities according to their own views of their self-interest. In sum, we cannot conclude that the national labor policy provides any support for such agreements. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 668]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand, the policy of the antitrust laws is clearly set against employer-union agreements seeking to prescribe labor standards outside the bargaining unit. One could hardly contend, for example, that one group of employers could lawfully demand that the union impose on other employers wages that were significantly higher than those paid by the requesting employers, or a system of computing wages that, because of differences in methods of production, would be more costly to one set of employers than to another. The anticompetitive potential of such a combination is obvious, but is little more severe than what is alleged to have been the purpose and effect of the conspiracy in this case to establish wages at a level that marginal producers could not pay so that they would be driven from the industry. And if the conspiracy presently under attack were declared exempt it would hardly be possible to deny exemption to such avowedly discriminatory schemes.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of antitrust policy, moreover, all such agreements between a group of employers and a union that the union will seek specified labor standards outside the bargaining unit suffer from a more basic defect, without regard to predatory intention or effect in the particular case. For the salient characteristic of such agreements is that the union surrenders its freedom of action with respect to its bargaining policy. Prior to the agreement the union might seek uniform standards in its own self-interest but would be required to assess in each case the probable costs and gains of a strike or other collective action to that end and thus might conclude that the objective of uniform standards should temporarily give way. After the agreement the union's interest would be bound in each case to that of the favored employer group. It is just such restraints upon the freedom of economic units to act according to their own choice and discretion that run counter to antitrust policy. See, e. g., Associated \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 669]\n\u00a0\n Press v. United States, \n326 \nU.S. 1, 19\n; Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 465\n; Anderson v. Shipowners Assn., \n272 \nU.S. 359, 364\n-365.\n\nThus the relevant labor and antitrust policies compel us to conclude that the alleged agreement between UMW and the large operators to secure uniform labor standards throughout the industry, if proved, was not exempt from the antitrust laws.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe UMW next contends that the trial court erroneously denied its motion for a new trial based on claimed errors in the admission of evidence.\n\nIn Eastern R. Conf. v. Noerr Motors, \n365 \nU.S. 127\n, the Court rejected an attempt to base a Sherman Act conspiracy on evidence consisting entirely of activities of competitors seeking to influence public officials. The Sherman Act, it was held, was not intended to bar concerted action of this kind even though the resulting official action damaged other competitors at whom the campaign was aimed. Furthermore, the legality of the conduct \"was not at all affected by any anticompetitive purpose it may have had,\" id., at 140 - even though the \"sole purpose in seeking to influence the passage and enforcement of laws was to destroy the truckers as competitors for the long-distance freight business,\" id., at 138. Nothing could be clearer from the Court's opinion than that anticompetitive purpose did not illegalize the conduct there involved.\n\nWe agree with the UMW that both the Court of Appeals and the trial court failed to take proper account of the Noerr case. In approving the instructions of the trial court with regard to the approaches of the union and the operators to the Secretary of Labor and to the TVA officials, the Court of Appeals considered Noerr as applying only to conduct \"unaccompanied by a purpose or intent to further a conspiracy to violate a statute. It is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 670]\n\u00a0\n the illegal purpose or intent inherent in the conduct which vitiates the conduct which would otherwise be legal.\" 325 F.2d, at 817. Noerr shields from the Sherman Act a concerted effort to influence public officials regardless of intent or purpose. The Court of Appeals, however, would hold the conduct illegal depending upon proof of an illegal purpose.\n\nThe instructions of the trial court to the jury exhibit a similar infirmity. The jury was instructed that the approach to the Secretary of Labor was legal unless part of a conspiracy to drive small operators out of business and that the approach to the TVA was not a violation of the antitrust laws \"unless the parties so urged the TVA to modify its policies in buying coal for the purpose of driving the small operators out of business.\" If, therefore, the jury determined the requisite anticompetitive purpose to be present, it was free to find an illegal conspiracy based solely on the Walsh-Healey and TVA episodes, or in any event to attribute illegality to these acts as part of a general plan to eliminate Phillips and other operators similarly situated. Neither finding, however, is permitted by Noerr for the reasons stated in that case. Joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct is not illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader scheme itself violative of the Sherman Act. The jury should have been so instructed and, given the obviously telling nature of this evidence, we cannot hold this lapse to be mere harmless error.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 671]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is another reason for remanding this case for further proceedings in the lower courts. It is clear under Noerr that Phillips could not collect any damages under the Sherman Act for any injury which it suffered from the action of the Secretary of Labor. The conduct of the union and the operators did not violate the Act, the action taken to set a minimum wage for government purchases of coal was the act of a public official who is not claimed to be a co-conspirator and the jury should have been instructed, as UMW requested, to exclude any damages which Phillips may have suffered as a result of the Secretary's Walsh-Healey determinations.\n4\n See also American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 358\n; Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha R. Co., \n151 \nU.S. 1, 16\n-21; Okefenokee Rural Elec. Mem. Corp. v. Florida P. & L. Co., 214 F.2d 413, 418 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1954). The trial court, however, admitted evidence \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 672]\n\u00a0\n concerning the Walsh-Healey episodes for \"whatever bearing it may have on the overall picture\" and told the jury in its final instructions to include in the verdict all damages resulting directly from any act which was found to be part of the conspiracy. The effect this may have had on the jury is reflected by the statement of the Court of Appeals that the jury could reasonably conclude \"that the wage determination for the coal industry under the Walsh-Healey Act and the dumping of West Kentucky coal on the TVA spot market materially and adversely affected the operations of Phillips in the important TVA market . . .,\" 325 F.2d, at 815, and that \"[t]his minimum wage determination prevented Phillips from bidding on the TVA term market . . . .\" id., at 814.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n [For opinion of MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG dissenting from the opinion but concurring in the reversal, see post, p. 697.]\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The parties stipulated that the damages period would include the four-year limitation period, 15 U.S.C. 15b (1958 ed.), preceding the filing of Phillips' cross claim and extend up to December 31, 1958, the date on which Phillips terminated its business.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Unilaterally, and without agreement with any employer group to do so, a union may adopt a uniform wage policy and seek vigorously to implement it even though it may suspect that some employers cannot effectively compete if they are required to pay the wage scale demanded by the union. The union need not gear its wage demands to wages which the weakest units in the industry can afford to pay. Such union conduct is not alone sufficient evidence to maintain a union-employer conspiracy charge under the Sherman Act. There must be additional direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy. There was, of course, other evidence in this case, but we indicate no opinion as to its sufficiency.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It would of course still be within the province of the trial judge to admit this evidence, if he deemed it probative and not unduly prejudicial, under the \"established judicial rule of evidence that testimony of prior or subsequent transactions, which for some reason are barred from forming the basis for a suit, may nevertheless be introduced if it tends reasonably to show the purpose and character \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 671]\n\u00a0\n of the particular transactions under scrutiny. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 46\n-47; United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26, 43\n-44.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 705\n; see also Heike v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 131, 145\n; American Medical Assn. v. United States, 76 U.S. App. D.C. 70, 87-89, 130 F.2d 233, 250-252 (1942), aff'd, \n317 \nU.S. 519\n (certiorari limited to other issues).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] By contrast, in Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., \n370 \nU.S. 690\n, we held that the acts of a wartime purchasing agent appointed by the Canadian Government could be proved as part of the conspiracy and as an element in computing damages. The purchasing agent, however, was not a public official but the wholly owned subsidiary of an American corporation alleged to be a principal actor in the conspiracy. The acts complained of had been performed at the direction of the purchasing agent's American parent and there was \"no indication that the Controller or any other official within the structure of the Canadian Government approved or would have approved of joint efforts to monopolize the production and sale of vanadium or directed that purchases from [the plaintiff] be stopped.\" \n370 \nU.S., at 706\n. That case is wholly dissimilar to both Noerr and the present case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This latter conclusion regarding the term market would seem doubly erroneous as Phillips had virtually conceded, in the course of offering evidence respecting bids of the alleged conspirators on the term market, that it was claiming no damages from its exclusion from the term market, a market it never had any immediate prospect of entering. The trial court ruled that the proffered testimony was inadmissible on the damages phase of the case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK agree, concurring.\n\nAs we read the opinion of the Court, it reaffirms the principles of Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n, and tells the trial judge:\n\nFirst. On the new trial the jury should be instructed that if there were an industry-wide collective bargaining agreement whereby employers and the union agreed on a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 673]\n\u00a0\n wage scale that exceeded the financial ability of some operators to pay and that if it was made for the purpose of forcing some employers out of business, the union as well as the employers who participated in the arrangement with the union should be found to have violated the antitrust laws.\n\nSecond. An industry-wide agreement containing those features is prima facie evidence of a violation.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nIn Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, supra, the union was promoting closed shops in the New York City area. It got contractors to purchase equipment only from local manufacturers who had closed-shop agreements with the union; and it got manufacturers to confine their New York City sales to contractors employing the union's members. Agencies were set up to boycott recalcitrant local contractors and manufacturers and bar from the area equipment manufactured outside its boundaries. As we said:\n\n\"The combination among the three groups, union, contractors, and manufacturers, became highly successful from the standpoint of all of them. The business of New York City manufacturers had a phenomenal growth, thereby multiplying the jobs available for the Local's members. Wages went up, hours were shortened, and the New York electrical equipment \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 674]\n\u00a0\n prices scared, to the decided financial profit of local contractors and manufacturers.\" \n325 \nU.S., at 800\n.\n\n\n I repeat what we said in Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, supra, at 811:\n\n\"The difficulty of drawing legislation primarily aimed at trusts and monopolies so that it could also be applied to labor organizations without impairing the collective bargaining and related rights of those organizations has been emphasized both by congressional and judicial attempts to draw lines between permissible and prohibited union activities. There is, however, one line which we can draw with assurance that we follow the congressional purpose. We know that Congress feared the concentrated power of business organizations to dominate markets and prices. It intended to outlaw business monopolies. A business monopoly is no less such because a union participates, and such participation is a violation of the [Sherman] Act.\"\n\n\n Congress can design an oligopoly for our society, if it chooses. But business alone cannot do so as long as the antitrust laws are enforced. Nor should business and labor working hand-in-hand be allowed to make that basic change in the design of our so-called free enterprise system. If the allegations in this case are to be believed, organized labor joined hands with organized business to drive marginal operators out of existence. According to those allegations the union used its control over West Kentucky Coal Co. and Nashville Coal Co. to dump coal at such low prices that respondents, who were small operators, had to abandon their business. According to those allegations there was a boycott by the union and the major companies against small companies who needed major companies' coal land on which to operate. According \n\n[381 \nU.S. 657, 675]\n\u00a0\n to those allegations high wage and welfare terms of employment were imposed on the small, marginal companies by the union and the major companies with the knowledge and intent that the small ones would be driven out of business.\n\nThe only architect of our economic system is Congress. We are right in adhering to its philosophy of the free enterprise system as expressed in the antitrust laws and as enforced by Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, supra, until the Congress delegates to big business and big labor the power to remold our economy in the manner charged here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"It is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators.

WOOD CO.(1965)\nNo. 291\nArgued: April 29, 1965Decided: May 24, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent filed this private antitrust suit in 1961, alleging violations of 7 of the Clayton Act and 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, arising out of petitioner's acquisition in 1956 of the assets of Insulation and Wires, Inc., which had been the primary distributor of electric insulation materials manufactured by respondent. Petitioner claimed that the action was barred by the four-year limitation provision of 4B of the Clayton Act, but respondent asserted that the bar of the statute was tolled under 5 (b) by a proceeding timely filed in 1960 against petitioner pursuant to 7 of the Clayton Act by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That proceeding resulted in a consent order under which petitioner was directed to divest itself of the acquired assets. Section 5 (a) of the Clayton Act makes a final judgment or decree in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the United States prima facie evidence in later private suits as to all matters respecting which that judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties. Section 5 (b) provides that a civil or criminal proceeding instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain or punish violations of the antitrust laws tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter for private actions arising under those laws and based on any matter complained of in the government suit. The District Court held that the statute had been tolled by 5 (b) and that the suit was timely filed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. Sections 5 (a) and 5 (b) of the Clayton Act are not wholly interdependent or coextensive. Pp. 316-318.\n\n\n (a) The words \"final judgment or decree\" are important in the application of 5 (a), while 5 (b), which applies to every private right of action based on any matter complained of in the government suit and is not limited to matters which would operate as an estoppel, tolls the statute of limitations regardless of whether a final judgment or decree is entered. Pp. 316-317. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 312]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) In 5 (a) Congress was concerned with the narrow issue of the use of judgments or decrees as prima facie evidence in private suits, whereas in 5 (b) Congress meant to assist private litigants in obtaining all the benefits they might cull from government antitrust actions. P. 317.\n\n\n 2. Absent any specific legislative history on the inclusion of FTC actions within the tolling provision, the issue is resolved by reliance on the clear expression of congressional intention that private suitors be given the benefits of prior government actions, which would necessarily include FTC proceedings. The benefits of 5 (b) should not depend on an arbitrary allocation of enforcement responsibility between the Department of Justice and the FTC. Pp. 320-322.\n\n\n 3. Petitioner's Sherman Act claims, arising from the asset acquisition which was the basis of the FTC proceeding, although requiring a greater burden of proof than the Clayton Act charges, clearly are based \"in part on any matter complained of\" in the FTC action. Pp. 322-324.\n\n\n 332 F.2d 346, affirmed.\n\nSidney P. Howell, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Charles C. Trelease and Edwin E. McAmis.\n\nAlbert G. Besser argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nLewis C. Green and Gustav B. Margraf filed a brief for Reynolds Metals Co., as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging affirmance, were filed by Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick, Frank Goodman, Robert B. Hummel and Irwin A. Seibel for the United States, and by Alex Akerman, Jr., Thomas A. Ziebarth and Robert E. Staed for Highland Supply Corp.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis private treble-damage antitrust action was brought by the New Jersey Wood Finishing Company against Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company and the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n Essex Wire Corporation.\n1\n Respondent's original complaint was filed on November 20, 1961.\n2\n It alleged violations of 7 of the Clayton Act,\n3\n a conspiracy to restrain commerce in electrical insulation products in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act and an attempt to monopolize the same as prohibited by 2.\n4\n The substance of the complaint concerned the acquisition in 1956 of all the assets of Insulation and Wires, Inc., a subsidiary of Essex, by Minnesota Mining and an alleged conspiracy to restrain trade in electrical insulation products. The latter claimed that the suit was barred by the four-year limitation provision of the Clayton Act.\n5\n However, New Jersey Wood asserted that the bar of the statute had been tolled by a proceeding filed in 1960 against Minnesota Mining by the Federal Trade Commission under 7 of the Clayton Act. That action resulted in a consent order under which Minnesota Mining was directed to divest itself of the assets acquired. Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act\n6\n provides \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n that a \"civil or criminal proceeding . . . instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws\" suspends the running of the statute of limitations during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter with respect to private actions arising under those laws and based on any matter complained of in the government suit. The questions here are whether proceedings by the Federal Trade Commission toll the running of the 4B statute of limitations to the same extent as do judicial proceedings and, if they do, whether the claim of New Jersey Wood is based on \"any matter complained of\" in the Commission action. The District Court denied Minnesota Mining's motion to dismiss, holding that the four-year statute had been tolled by 5 (b) and that this suit was timely filed. 216 F. Supp. 507. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 332 F.2d 346. We granted certiorari because of a conflict between circuits\n7\n and the importance of the question in the administration of the Clayton Act. \n379 \nU.S. 877\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey Wood is engaged in the manufacture of electrical insulation materials, some of which it sells to independent distributors who, in turn, sell to wire and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n cable manufacturers and fabricators. Minnesota Mining is a diversified company, with one of its divisions producing electrical insulation materials. Essex is a substantial consumer of electrical insulation material. It owned Insulation Wires which distributes that type of material.\n\nIn August 1956 Minnesota Mining bought all the assets of Insulation Wires and in 1960 the Federal Trade Commission filed a proceeding against it under 7 of the Clayton Act which resulted in a consent order directing the divestiture by Minnesota Mining of the assets so acquired. This order was dated August 24, 1961. The Commission charged that prior to 1953 Minnesota Mining was the leading manufacturer of electrical insulation tape; that through five transactions in the years 1952 through 1956 it had also brought under its control substantial shares of other major electrical product lines; and that its subsequent acquisition of two of the three largest distributors of these products might have the effect of actually or potentially lessening competition and tending to create a monopoly in various aspects of that commerce. One of the two distributors so acquired was Insulation Wires.\n\nThereafter, within a year, this suit was filed. We need not detail the allegations of the complaint. It is sufficient to say that the gist of it was that prior to August 1956 Insulation Wires was the primary distributor of New Jersey Wood products throughout the United States; that in August 1956 Minnesota Mining acquired all of the assets of Insulation Wires and during the next month notified New Jersey Wood that beginning in January 1957 Insulation Wires would no longer distribute its products. The complaint also charged Minnesota Mining and Essex with conspiring to restrain trade and commerce in the manufacture, sale and distribution of electrical insulation products beginning with the acquisition of Insulation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n Wires and continuing until the filing of this suit. There were numerous overt acts alleged as being in furtherance of the conspiracy, the first of which was that acquisition.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAt the outset it is necessary to examine 5 (a) of the Clayton Act\n8\n and its relationship to 5 (b). The former makes a final judgment or decree in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the United States prima facie evidence in subsequent private suits \"as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties thereto.\" Several distinctions between these sections are apparent and suggest that they are not wholly interdependent. First, the words \"final judgment or decree\" are used in 5 (a) and are of crucial significance in its application. However, 5 (b) tolls the statute of limitations set out in 4B from the time suit is instituted by the United States regardless of whether a final judgment or decree is ultimately entered. Its applicability in no way turns on the success of the Government in prosecuting its case. Moreover, under 5 (a) the judgment or decree may be used only as to matters respecting which it would operate as an estoppel between the parties. No such limitation appears \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 317]\n\u00a0\n in the tolling provision. It applies to every private right of action based in whole or in part on \"any matter\" complained of in the government suit.\n\nWhen we turn from the express language of these two statutory provisions to the congressional policies underlying them, it becomes even more apparent that the applicability of 5 (a) to Federal Trade Commission actions should not control the question whether such proceedings toll the statute of limitations. We have discussed these policies at greater length below. At this juncture it is sufficient to say that in framing 5 (a) Congress focused on the narrow issue of the use by private parties of judgments or decrees as prima facie evidence. This was recognized in Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., \n340 \nU.S. 558\n (1951), where we stated that the purpose of 5 (a) was \"to minimize the burdens of litigation for injured private suitors by making available to them all matters previously established by the Government in antitrust actions\" and to permit them \"as large an advantage as the estoppel doctrine would afford had the Government brought suit.\" Id., at 568. As we shall show, however, its purpose in adopting 5 (b) was not so limited, for it was not then dealing with the delicate area in which a judgment secured in an action between two parties may be used by a third. Whatever ambiguities may exist in the legislative history of these provisions as to other questions, it is plain that in 5 (b) Congress meant to assist private litigants in utilizing any benefits they might cull from government antitrust actions. See S. Rep. No. 619, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 6. The distinction was emphasized in Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. v. Nisley, 300 F.2d 561 (1962), where the court, after noting the analysis of 5 (a) set out in Emich Motors Corp., supra, stated that:\n\n \"The corollary purpose of the tolling provisions of the second paragraph of Section 5 [now 5 (b)] is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n to vouchsafe the intended benefits of related government proceedings by suspending the running of the statute of limitations until the termination of the government proceedings, and allowing the private suitor one year thereafter in which to prepare and file his suit. The competency of a government judgment in a private suit is necessarily restricted to the requirements of due process. But the tolling of the statute during the pendency of the government litigation is not so limited.\" Id., at 569.\n\n\n In our view, therefore, the two sections are not necessarily coextensive; they are governed by different considerations as well as congressional policy objectives. This makes 5 (b) readily severable from 5 (a). Even if we assumed arguendo that 5 (a) is inapplicable to Commission proceedings - a question upon which we venture no opinion - that conclusion would be immaterial in our consideration of 5 (b) and 4B. Congress has expressed its belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws. This construction will lend considerable impetus to that policy.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nSection 5, later 5 (a) and 5 (b), was passed in response to the plea of President Wilson. In a speech to the Congress on January 20, 1914, he urged that a law be enacted which would permit victims of antitrust violations to have \"redress upon the facts and judgments proved and entered in suits by the Government\" and that \"the statute of limitations . . . be suffered to run against such litigants only from the date of the conclusion of the Government's action.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 1964. The broad aim of this enactment was to use \"private self-interest as a means of enforcement\" of the antitrust laws. Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., \n330 \nU.S. 743, 751\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n (1947). The \"entire provision [was] intended to help persons of small means who are injured in their property or business by combinations or corporations violating the antitrust laws.\" H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 14. See S. Rep. No. 619, supra, at 6.\n\nIt may be, as Minnesota Mining contends, that when it was enacted the tolling provision was a logical backstop for the prima facie evidence clause of 5 (a). But even though 5 (b) complements 5 (a) in this respect by permitting a litigant to await the outcome of government proceedings and use any judgment or decree rendered therein - a benefit which often is of limited practical value\n9\n - it is certainly not restricted to that effect. As we have pointed out, the textual distinctions as well as the policy basis of 5 (b) indicate that it was to serve a more comprehensive function in the congressional scheme of things. The Government's initial action may aid the private litigant in a number of other ways. The pleadings, transcripts of testimony, exhibits and documents are available to him in most instances. In fact, the rules of the Commission so provide. 16 CFR 1.132 (e). See generally 16 CFR 1.131 et seq. Moreover, difficult questions of law may be tested and definitively resolved before the private litigant enters the fray. The greater resources and expertise of the Commission and its staff render the private suitor a tremendous benefit aside from any value he may derive from a judgment or decree. Indeed, so useful is this service that government proceedings are recognized as a major source of evidence for private parties. See Bicks, The Department of Justice and Private Treble Damage Actions, 4 Antitrust Bull. 5 (1959); Loevinger, Handling a Plaintiff's Antitrust Damage Suit, 4 Antitrust Bull. 29 (1959). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdmittedly, there is little in the legislative history to suggest that Congress consciously intended to include Commission actions within the sweep of the tolling provision. But neither is there any substantial evidence that it consciously intended to exclude them. The fact of the matter is that the record of the 1914 legislative proceedings reveals an almost complete absence of any discussion on the tolling problem. It seems that Congress simply did not consider the extent of its coverage in the course of its deliberations.\n\nIt is in light of this legislative silence that we must determine whether 4B is tolled by Commission proceedings. In resolving this question we must necessarily rely on the one element of congressional intention which is plain on the record - the clearly expressed desire that private parties be permitted the benefits of prior government actions. Implicit in such an objective is the necessity that the tolling provision include Commission proceedings. Otherwise the benefits flowing from a major segment of the Government's enforcement effort would, in many cases, be denied to private parties. In this connection, and of crucial significance, is the fact that the potential advantages available to such litigants because of 5 (b) reach far beyond the specific and limited benefits accruing to them under 5 (a). Furthermore, the 5 (b) advantages flow as naturally from Commission proceedings as they do from Justice Department actions. Yet petitioner contends that 4B must be tolled in the latter but not in the former. Such a grudging interpretation of the interrelationship of 5 (b) and 4B, however, would collide head-on with Congress' basic policy objectives. Acceptance of petitioner's position would make enjoyment of these intended benefits turn on the arbitrary allocation of enforcement responsibility between the Department and the Commission, and we must therefore reject it. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is true that the precise language of 5 (b) does not clearly encompass Commission proceedings. But it is not the literal wording of such a provision that is controlling where, as here, Congress has evidenced neither acceptance nor rejection of either interpretation, yet one effects a clearly expressed congressional purpose while the other defeats it. We stated the pivotal question for determination in such an event only this Term in Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 424, 427\n (1965): \"[W]hether congressional purpose is effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in given circumstances.\" In order to determine that intent, we must examine \"the purposes and policies underlying the limitation provision, the Act itself, and the remedial scheme developed for the enforcement of the rights given by the Act.\" Ibid. Guided by these criteria, we think it clear that congressional policy sustaining 5 (b) would be effectively served only by tolling the statute of limitations in cases such as this, and we deem that policy controlling. This analysis is not a novel one. Mr. Justice Holmes, sitting on circuit, noted in Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32:\n\n\"A statute may indicate or require as its justification a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind. The Legislature has the power to decide what the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will should be recognized and obeyed. The major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.\"\n\n\n We hold, therefore, that the limitation provision of 4B is tolled by Commission proceedings to the same extent \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n and in the same circumstances as it is by Justice Department actions. In so holding we give effect to Congress' basic policy objectives in enacting 5 (b) - objectives which would be frustrated should we reach a contrary conclusion and thereby deprive large numbers of private litigants of the benefits of government antitrust suits simply because those suits were pursued by one governmental agency rather than the other.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nMinnesota Mining further contends that even though 5 (b) tolls Commission proceedings, the suit here, insofar as it asserts Sherman Act claims, is not based in part on any matter complained of in the Commission's proceeding. We cannot agree.\n\nNew Jersey Wood's Sherman Act claims rest on an alleged conspiracy to restrain and attempt to monopolize trade and commerce in the manufacture, sale and distribution of electrical insulation products. The purposes of the conspiracy were alleged to be: (1) to control Insulation Wires; (2) to prevent it from distributing New Jersey Wood products; (3) to insure that Insulation Wires' supplies were purchased from a Minnesota Mining subsidiary; (4) to effect tie-in sales of electrical insulation products with other Minnesota Mining products; and (5) to have Essex deal only with Insulation Wires in purchasing electrical insulation products to the exclusion of competitive distributors handling New Jersey Wood products. The effect of the conspiracy was alleged to be the complete disruption of the pattern of manufacture, sale and distribution that New Jersey Wood had enjoyed with Insulation Wires and denial to it of access to substantial national markets for electrical insulation products.\n\nCertainly the allegations are based \"in part\" on the Commission action. It charged that the Insulation Wires acquisition, along with that of another distributor, placed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 323]\n\u00a0\n in the hands of Minnesota Mining, a manufacturer, two of the three largest distributors in the business; that following the acquisitions these distributors discontinued distribution of the products of a number of manufacturers who had used them prior to their acquisition by Minnesota Mining; and that the effect of such action by Minnesota Mining was \"the actual or potential lessening of competition\" in the manufacture, sale and distribution of insulation products and the foreclosure of other manufacturers from a substantial share of the markets for said products. It appears to us that both suits set up substantially the same claims. It is true that the Commission's Clayton Act proceeding required proof only of a potential anticompetitive effect while the Sherman Act carries the more onerous burden of proof of an actual restraint. The Commission complaint, however, did allege an \"actual\" as well as a \"potential\" lessening of competition, i. e., manufacturers \"have been foreclosed from a substantial share of the markets.\" Moreover, the monopolization count was phrased in terms of an \"attempt to monopolize,\" which may be illegal though not successful. See United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495, 525\n, 531-532 (1948).\n\nMinnesota Mining's claim seems to be that the crucial difference between the Commission and the New Jersey Wood proceedings is that the former alleges conduct that may substantially lessen competition while the latter asserts activity that has actually done so. We think that this is a distinction without a difference and does not deprive New Jersey Wood of the tolling effect of 5 (b). That clause provides for tolling as long as the private claim is based \"in part on any matter complained of\" in the government proceedings. The fact that New Jersey Wood claims that the same conduct has a greater anti-competitive effect does not make the conduct challenged any less a matter complained of in the government action. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 324]\n\u00a0\n It merely requires it to meet a greater burden of proof as to the effect of the conspiracy before a Sherman Act claim can be sustained.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN and MR.

JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nSection 4B of the Clayton Act bars a private antitrust damage suit unless brought within four years after the cause of action arises.\n1\n Section 5 (b) of the Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b) (1964 ed.), however, suspends the running of this limitation period \"[w]henever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws . . . .\" I am unable to agree with the Court's holding that a purely administrative proceeding initiated by the Federal Trade Commission and decided by that same regulatory agency is the kind of \"civil or criminal proceeding . . . instituted by the United States . . .\" which tolls the statute of limitations under 5 (b). The Court itself concedes that even as amended \"the precise language of 5 (b) does not clearly encompass Commission proceedings\" and that \"there is little in the legislative history to suggest that Congress consciously intended to include Commission actions within the sweep of the tolling provision.\" And the Solicitor General, while urging as amicus curiae the result the Court reaches today, candidly admits that this \"result is difficult and perhaps impossible to justify in terms of conventional analysis of the text and legislative history . . . .\" It is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 325]\n\u00a0\n because I think both the language of the statute and the legislative history persuasively, if not conclusively, show that Congress did not intend the construction the Court gives 5 (b) today, that I am unable to agree with its decision.\n\nThe whole of 5, now divided into subdivisions (a) and (b), was passed in response to President Wilson's 1914 plea to Congress to enact a law designed to make it easier for antitrust victims to collect damages through private lawsuits since preparing an antitrust case against a major corporate defendant was a larger task than most injured persons could undertake. To accomplish that single purpose he recommended to Congress, as the Court notes, two things - that these victims be permitted to seek \"redress upon the facts and judgments proved and entered in suits by the Government\" and also that \"the statute of limitations . . . be suffered to run against such litigants only from the date of the conclusion of the Government's action.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 1964. Congress accepted the President's recommendation and passed 5, a single section in two paragraphs, making \"a final judgment or decree . . . rendered in any criminal prosecution or in any suit or proceeding in equity brought by or on behalf of the United States . . . prima facie evidence\" against a civil antitrust defendant and tolling the statute of limitations during the pendency of \"any suit or proceeding in equity or criminal prosecution . . . instituted by the United States . . . .\" This language of 5 as it passed the Congress in 1914 clearly did not refer to administrative proceedings but to antitrust suits or criminal prosecutions instituted by the Government in civil or criminal courts. Moreover, the purpose and effect of the two parts of this provision were obviously complementary, permitting the injured party to utilize a final judgment obtained by the Government and also providing a means whereby the injured party could await the result of the government action \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 326]\n\u00a0\n confident that his suit would not be barred by the statute of limitations. In the words of one of the committee reports, the \"entire provision is intended to help persons of small means who are injured in their property or business by combinations or corporations violating the antitrust laws.\" H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 14. (Emphasis supplied.) See S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 45. Therefore, both the language and the complementary nature of the two paragraphs of 5 ought to show beyond any doubt that the whole section as passed was intended to apply to the same kind of proceeding in the same kind of tribunal - that is a proceeding brought in a civil or criminal court, the only tribunal which in common understanding has power to render the kind of \"final judgment or decree\" mentioned in 5 (a).\n2\n Furthermore, since the two paragraphs of 5 when offered and when passed were regarded as an entity because of their identical language and purpose, it is not surprising that the Senators and Congressmen addressing themselves to 5 did not specifically direct their remarks to the tolling provision as distinct from the effect to be given a court judgment or decree. Those discussing the measure naturally treated the \"suit or proceeding in equity\" or \"criminal prosecution\" set out in both paragraphs in identical terms as referring to the same kind of proceeding in the same kind of tribunal, namely a court. It is true that the language was changed in 1955 from \"suit or proceeding in equity\" and \"criminal \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 327]\n\u00a0\n prosecution\" to \"civil or criminal proceeding,\" the present language, but the legislative history of the 1955 amendment affirmatively shows that there was no intention to affect in any way the kind of court proceedings necessary to suspend the statute of limitations. Thus, I am unable to go along with the Court in construing the tolling provision of 5 (b) as though it applies to both court and Trade Commission proceedings while treating 5 (a) as though it may apply to court proceedings only. Such a holding would, in my judgment, run counter to the whole legislative history of the 1914 Act.\n\nI am setting out as an Appendix some of the legislative history of the original Act and of the 1955 amendment, which points out specifically something which does not surprise me at all: that while Congress was ready to make the final judgment of a court prima facie evidence against a defendant, it was at the same time entirely unwilling to give such effect to administrative hearings and orders and was also unwilling to toll the statute of limitations during the pendency of such proceedings. It is true that many administrative agencies now conduct hearings, make findings, and issue orders in a way more or less comparable to courts. I doubt, however, that the time has even yet come when Congress would be willing to compel judges and juries to treat administrative orders as prima facie proof of a violation of law, either civil or criminal, or to treat those proceedings as though they were conducted in a court of law with all the protections there afforded litigants.\n\nI would reverse this judgment.\n\n APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE BLACK, DISSENTING.\n\n\n   THE 1914 ACT.\n\n\n Herewith for illustration are statements made about 5 of the 1914 Clayton Act by Senators and Congressmen \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 328]\n\u00a0\n particularly interested in 5, all of whom took part in the preparation and sponsorship of the 1914 bill or the discussions that took place as it went through the House and Senate.\n\nSenator Walsh, the spokesman for the Judiciary Committee, led the fight for the House version of 5 and defended it on the ground that the defendant \"has had an opportunity to try out before a court, with all the forms of the law, every question involved in the lawsuit. . . .\" 51 Cong. Rec. 13851. (Emphasis added.) And Senator Walsh later added that \"Here the party has had his day in court. He has tried every issue, and it is simply a question, now that he has had it tried, whether he may insist upon a second trial.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 13857. (Emphasis added.) Opponents of the \"conclusive evidence\" proposal of the House bill never challenged the premise, implicit in the remarks of Senator Walsh and others, that only judgments rendered in judicial proceedings were contemplated by 5. Not once did any member of Congress suggest that under the House version, administrative findings based upon evidence which would not be admissible in a court should be conclusive of the defendant's liability in a later treble-damage action.\n\nSenator Walsh, in arguing that his proposal would not violate the Constitution, again emphasized that 5 did not apply to administrative orders, but only to judgments or decrees of the courts:\n\n \"I want to say just a word with reference to the authorities to which the attention of the Senate has been invited . . . . Nobody questions them. They all lay down the rule that in an action brought against an individual who has never theretofore had his day in court you can not make a certificate or a recital or an order of an administrative board or anything of that kind conclusive evidence against him.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 13856-13857. (Emphasis added.) \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 329]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n On the other hand, there were Senators who thought a judgment or decree for a defendant should be equally binding on a treble-damage plaintiff. In opposing this idea, Senator White argued:\n\n \"Then, Mr. President, as has been said, it is burdensome enough to require parties to the litigation themselves to be bound by the findings of a court or jury in a particular case. So many things that we can not at the time possibly foresee influence such decisions. The way in which the evidence is produced may have its effect upon a jury or a court.\n\n\n \"The manner in which the case is handled by the lawyers employed may determine in the mind of a jury or a court what the verdict or the judgment shall be, and yet, Mr. President, those things should probably not have been controlling influences in the conclusions reached.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 13900. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n And Senator Cummins said: \"But when the suit is brought, then the judgment or decree of the court in the suit that has been brought by the Government would be prima facie evidence of violation of the antitrust law . . . .\" 51 Cong. Rec. 13850. (Emphasis added.)\n\nWhen the bill left the conference committee and went back to the House, the managers were called on to defend the changes against charges that elimination of the criminal penalties had emasculated the bill. Chairman Webb of the House Judiciary Committee attempted to describe the proposed enforcement procedures in the strongest possible light. After reading the provision vesting enforcement responsibility in the Trade Commission, he stated:\n\n \"Now, the value of these two sections is this: That they not only give the individual the right to sue for treble damages where he pleases, and we not only \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 330]\n\u00a0\n suspend the statute of limitations against an individual if a Government suit is brought against a trust, but we also require the Federal Trade Commission to stop these practices and take those guilty of such practices into court.\n\n\n \"But that is not all. Some argue that after the Trade Commission takes jurisdiction that excludes individuals from pursuing these other remedies. The bill further provides:\n\n\n \"`No order of the commission or board or the judgment of the court to enforce the same shall in any wise relieve or absolve any person from any liability under the antitrust acts.'\n\n\n \"So you have three or four distinct remedies, all of which may be invoked at the same time.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 16274. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n It is clear therefore that Chairman Webb distinguished between suits by the \"Government\" - the suits to which the tolling provision applied - and proceedings of the Federal Trade Commission. He believed that the statute was suspended only when actions were brought under the direction of the Attorney General. This was confirmed a few moments later by the following exchange:\n\n \"Mr. HARDY. Under the bill does the Government have the authority to bring suit for injunction as well as private parties?\n\n\n \"Mr. WEBB. Yes. Section 15 gives the district attorneys under the direction of the Attorney General the right to apply for an injunction.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 16276.\n\n\n The day following Chairman Webb's remarks Representative Floyd, another of the House managers, again attempted to persuade the House that the enforcement scheme contemplated by the bill was strong:\n\n \"That is not all. Under section 5 of the bill any private litigant injured by the unlawful acts of any \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 331]\n\u00a0\n corporation where the Government of the United States has proceeded against such corporation and obtained a judgment, either in a court of law or equity, is allowed the use of that judgment or decree to show the unlawful acts of the combination to the full extent that it would be an estoppel between the Government and the original offender. . . . That is a new remedy and a most efficient remedy. The Government of the United States, acting in behalf of all of its citizens, prosecutes a trust, convicts it either in a criminal court or a civil court, and the private litigant, injured by the unlawful acts of such trust, has nothing to do in order to recover the three-fold damages except to prove the amount of damages and that the injury was done by this trust or corporation. . . .\n\n\n  .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"But that is not all. There are several other remedies provided in this bill. Under section 11 the violation of sections 2, 3, 7, and 8 may be enforced, respectively, by the Trade Commission, by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or by the Federal Reserve Board.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 16319. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Another relevant discussion in the House is the following:\n\n \"Mr. McKENZIE: If this section is left in the bill, do you not feel and believe that this decree that is mentioned in this section should be the decree of the court of last resort - the Supreme Court of the land?\n\n\n \"Mr. VOLSTEAD. No.\n\n\n  .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. McKENZIE. You think it would be good policy to leave a matter of such great importance in the hands of an inferior court?\n\n\n \"Mr. VOLSTEAD. Yes.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 9079. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 332]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n As originally presented to the House, 5 also made a \"judgment or decree\" rendered in a \"suit or proceeding in equity brought by or on behalf of the United States\" conclusive against any prospective treble-damage plaintiff. Opponents of this clause vigorously challenged the constitutionality of binding a party who had never had his \"day in court.\" The debates made it clear time and again that the proceeding contemplated was an action brought for the United States by the Attorney General, not an administrative proceeding:\n\n \"Mr. SISSON. . . . [D]oes the gentleman believe that his rights in the court should be determined upon the questions raised by the Attorney General of the United States?\n\n\n \"Mr. PROUTY. Why, certainly not; the Constitution expressly prohibits it. In other words, the Attorney General could go in and prevent my having a trial before a jury.\n\n\n \"Mr. SISSON. That is the point I had in mind.\n\n\n \"Mr. PROUTY. By instituting a proceeding in equity and having the case tried.\n\n\n \"Mr. SISSON. That is the point I had in mind, that the Attorney General, if he was disposed to do so - we would not charge that of any particular Attorney General - might cook up a case which would directly defeat the rights of every individual if he had been injured.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 9492.\n\n\n Defenders of the proposition, on the other hand, stated:\n\n \"Mr. CULLOP. My question is this: Supposing a collusive suit was brought and the defendant won on the issue, then is every outsider barred from any further suit? According to this language he is.\n\n\n \"Mr. FLOYD of Arkansas . . . .\n\n\n \". . . My answer to that proposition is that if the time ever comes in this Government when any Attorney \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 333]\n\u00a0\n General will enter into collusive suits with corporations and combinations engaged in unlawful acts, it will be an evil day for our Republic, a day when every statute will become useless and justice will become a mockery.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 9489.\n\n\n Furthermore, an amendment was in fact offered to the Senate which arguably would have resulted in bringing administrative proceedings within the scope of the phrase \"suit or proceeding.\" The amendment met with opposition and was withdrawn. The House bill originally dealt only with a \"suit or proceeding in equity,\" and did not apply to criminal proceedings. After the bill reached the Senate, Senator Bryan moved to strike out the words \"in equity,\" so the provision would read simply \"any suit or proceeding.\" As observed by Senator Reed, \"That would cover any kind of proceeding.\" Senator Culberson proposed a substitute adding the phrase \"criminal prosecution or,\" and retaining the phrase \"in equity.\" Senator Bryan withdrew his broader proposal and accepted Senator Culberson's limited substitute. 51 Cong. Rec. 13897-13898.\n\nThe House initially passed the Act with four substantive sections, each having a criminal penalty attached. All of the criminal penalties were removed in the Senate or in conference. Senator Reed of Missouri, leading the opposition to the bill, charged repeatedly that the Clayton Act had been stripped of all force and effectiveness:\n\n\"We end by providing a smooth and easy road which may be traveled through the years, until finally a commission shall issue an innocuous, non-enforcible decree, a decree that can be vitalized only by being affirmed by a court. At the conclusion of all the litigation we propose to impose no penalty, levy no fine, send no one to jail, and we permit the culprit to preserve his swag!\" 51 Cong. Rec. 15867. (Emphasis added.) \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 334]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Had the proponents of the measure contemplated the use of administrative findings as evidence it appears that the obvious answer to Senator Reed would have been that the bill does have teeth for the Commission's order would be admissible as prima facie evidence against the \"culprit,\" and private claimants would be able to reclaim \"his swag,\" three times over. Neither this, nor any other answer challenging the accuracy of Senator Reed's statement, was heard on the Senate floor, although his complaint was repeatedly made. And in the House, Representative Nelson charged:\n\n\"Finally, the penalty is cut out; they can do all these things, and the Trade Commission can only say, `You must not do it any more.' Then there is the long delay in an appeal to the courts; and they go through the courts. And then what? There may be an injunction issued, but they have got away with the loot with impunity.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 16325.\n\n\n For further examples see 51 Cong. Rec. 9079, 9169, 9488-9490, 9492, 9494-9495, 12789-12790, 13850-13851, 13856-13857, 13897-13898, 13900, 14262, 14328, 15867, 15948, 15950, 16003, 16044, 16046, 16149, 16154, 16274, 16281, 16319, 16325.\n\n   THE 1955 AMENDMENT.\n\n\n The committee reports on the amendment detailed carefully every change the bill would make, but there is absolutely no evidence that there was any intent to amend 5 (b) for the purpose of suspending the statute of limitations during the pendency of Federal Trade Commission hearings. See H. R. Rep. No. 422, 84th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 619, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. And the debates and the hearings affirmatively show that no change was intended. For example, in the 1951 hearings Representative Patman appeared before the House subcommittee considering the bill and questioned whether 5 had been changed to deny the right of a private \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 335]\n\u00a0\n litigant to use a judgment obtained by the Government. Representative Wilson assured him that: \"This doesn't change the present law.\" Representative Keating, the author of the bill, then commented: \"I think there is a slight change in existing law where it refers to the subsequent numbers. There has to be a change in phraseology in that because of what we have done in section 4. I believe that is the only change.\" Hearings on H. R. 3408 before the Subcommittee on Study of Monopoly Power of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., Part 3, 98-100. And on the floor of the House in the discussion of the bill which became the present law, Representative Quigley stated:\n\n \"It was the specific purpose of the committee in reporting this bill to in no way affect the substantive rights of individual litigants. It is simply a procedural change and suggested with the thought of setting up a uniform statute of limitations. That is the sole purpose.\" 101 Cong. Rec. 5131.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 4B of the Clayton Act, 69 Stat. 283, 15 U.S.C. 15b (1964 ed.), provides that:\n\n\"Any action to enforce any cause of action under sections 15 or 15a of this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] And of course, it is not at all clear that this is a suit \"instituted by the United States.\" The Department of Justice brings suits and criminal prosecutions in the name of the United States, while an independent regulatory agency sues and is sued in its own name. And the United States does not initiate the proceedings before an administrative agency. Here for example the Federal Trade Commission filed the proceeding against petitioner. However, because of the view I take of the other language in the section, I find it unnecessary to decide this question.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nWith all deference, I dissent. I agree with the Court, ante, at 321, that, as we recently stated in Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 424, 427\n, the pivotal question for determination is \"whether congressional purpose is effectuated by tolling the statute of limitations in given circumstances.\" I cannot agree, however, that the Court has correctly applied that test in this case. As my Brother BLACK has so well demonstrated in his dissenting opinion, both the language and legislative history of the statutes before us clearly show that Congress did not intend that the statute of limitations applicable to private antitrust actions be tolled by the institution of a Federal Trade Commission administrative proceeding. Cf. United States v. Welden, \n377 \nU.S. 95\n. It frustrates rather than effectuates congressional purpose to fail to honor the express intent of Congress in this given circumstance. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 311, 336]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOODY v.

The employer paid his rent and provided him with a per diem expense allowance for each day of the year, including weekends and holidays, to cover \"the necessary living expenditures in the Korean economy.\" He worked on a \"365 day per year basis . . . subject to call to the job site at any time.\" He \"quite often\" worked on Saturdays and Sundays and at other times outside the normal work day. The employer considered all its employees to be \"in the course of regular occupation from the time they leave the United States until their return.\" The employer expected the decedent and its other employees to seek recreation away from the job site on weekends and holidays.\n\nBased upon the above stipulated facts, the Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees' Compensation, United States Department of Labor, petitioner herein, determined \"that the accident and the subsequent death of the decedent arose out of and in the course of employment.\" 222 F. Supp. 4, 6. He therefore awarded death benefits to the decedent's widow and a minor child in accordance with the terms of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq. (1958 ed.), as extended by the Defense Base Act, 55 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1651 et seq. (1958 ed.). The employer and its insurance carrier, respondents herein, then brought this action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida to set aside and enjoin the enforcement of this compensation award. The District Court affirmed the compensation award and granted the Deputy Commissioner's motion for summary judgment. 222 F. Supp. 4. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit summarily reversed and set aside the award. 327 F.2d 1003. But compare the later decision of another panel of the Fifth Circuit in O'Keeffe v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 338 F.2d 319.\n\nThe petition for writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. Section 2 (2) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 902 (2) (1958 ed.), provides workmen's compensation for any \"accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment.\" Section 19 (a), 33 U.S.C. 919 (a) (1958 ed.), provides for the filing of a \"claim for compensation\" and specifies that \"the deputy commissioner shall have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.\" Section 20 (a), 33 U.S.C. 920 (a) (1958 ed.), provides that \"[i]n any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\" Finally, 21 (b), 33 U.S.C. 921 (b) (1958 ed.), provides that the Deputy Commissioner's compensation order may be suspended and set aside by a reviewing court only \"[i]f not in accordance with law.\"\n\nIn cases decided both before and after the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 237, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. (1958 ed.), the Court has held that the foregoing statutory provisions limit the scope of judicial review of the Deputy Commissioner's determination that a \"particular injury arose out of and in the course of employment.\" Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., \n330 \nU.S. 469, 477\n-478; O'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., \n340 \nU.S. 504, 507\n-508.\n\n  \"It matters not that the basic facts from which the Deputy Commissioner draws this inference are undisputed rather than controverted. . . . It is likewise \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n immaterial that the facts permit the drawing of diverse inferences. The Deputy Commissioner alone is charged with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not be disturbed by a reviewing court. . . . Moreover, the fact that the inference of the type here made by the Deputy Commissioner involves an application of a broad statutory term or phrase to a specific set of facts gives rise to no greater scope of judicial review. . . .\" Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., supra, at 478.\n\n\n The rule of judicial review has therefore emerged that the inferences drawn by the Deputy Commissioner are to be accepted unless they are irrational or \"unsupported by substantial evidence on the record . . . as a whole.\" O'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., supra, at 508.\n\nThe Brown-Pacific-Maxon case held that the standard to be applied by the Deputy Commissioner does not require \"a causal relation between the nature of employment of the injured person and the accident. Thom v. Sinclair, 1917. A. C. 127, 142. Nor is it necessary that the employee be engaged at the time of the injury in activity of benefit to his employer. All that is required is that the `obligations or conditions' of employment create the `zone of special danger' out of which the injury arose.\" Id., at 507. And, borrowing from language in Matter of Waters v. Taylor Co., 218 N. Y. 248, 252, 112 N. E. 727, 728, the Court in Brown-Pacific-Maxon drew the line only at cases where an employee had become \"so thoroughly disconnected from the service of his employer that it would be entirely unreasonable to say that injuries suffered by him arose out of and in the course of his employment.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 507\n. This standard is in accord with the humanitarian nature of the Act as exemplified by the statutory command that \"[i]n any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\" 20 (a), 33 U.S.C. 920 (a).\n\nIn this case, the Deputy Commissioner, applying the Brown-Pacific-Maxon standard to the undisputed facts, concluded \"that the accident and the subsequent death of the decedent arose out of and in the course of employment.\" 222 F. Supp. 4, 6. The District Court, likewise applying the Brown-Pacific-Maxon standard, held \"that the Deputy Commissioner was correct in his finding that the conditions of the deceased's employment created a zone where the deceased Ecker had to seek recreation under exacting and unconventional conditions and that therefore the accident and death of the decedent arose out of and in the course of employment.\" 222 F. Supp., at 9.\n\nWe agree that the District Court correctly affirmed the finding of the Deputy Commissioner. While this Court may not have reached the same conclusion as the Deputy Commissioner, it cannot be said that his holding that the decedent's death, in a zone of danger, arose out of and in the course of his employment is irrational or without substantial evidence on the record as a whole. The decedent was hired to work in the exacting and unconventional conditions of Korea. His transportation over and back was to be at the employer's expense, and while there he was considered to be working on a 365-day-per-year basis, subject to call at the job site at any time, and quite often he worked Saturdays and Sundays and at other times outside the working day. The employer considered decedent and all other employees at this hazardous overseas base to be \"in the course of regular occupation from the time they leave the United States until their return.\" Finally, the employer provided neither housing nor recreational activities for its employees, but expected them to live, while necessarily in the country to perform its work, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n under the exacting and dangerous conditions of Korea. The employer paid decedent's rent and provided him with a per diem expense allowance for each day of the year, including weekends and holidays, to cover the necessary living expenses in the Korean economy. The accident here occurred on an outing for a short period of time on a lake located only 30 miles from the employer's job site. In the words of the District Court, \"It was reasonable to conclude that recreational activities contributed to a higher efficiency of the employer's work and that when conducted in the restricted area of employment, on a work day, so to speak, and in a manner not prohibited by the employer, such activity was an incident of the employment.\" 222 F. Supp. 4, 9.\n\nThe dissent, while giving lip service to the Brown-Pacific-Maxon standards, would reverse the determination of the Deputy Commissioner and District Court here, as well as the Deputy Commissioner and the Courts of Appeals in other cases, that the several accidents involved were within the \"zone of special danger.\" As Brown-Pacific-Maxon made clear, it is just this type of determination which the statute leaves to the Deputy Commissioner subject only to limited judicial review. Indeed, this type of determination, depending as it does on an analysis of the many factors involved in the area of the employment, would seem to be one peculiarly for the Deputy Commissioner.\n\nThe District Court therefore correctly upheld the determination of the Deputy Commissioner and the Court of Appeals erred in summarily reversing its judgment. Cf. O'Keeffe v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 338 F.2d 319 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1964); Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Hearne, 335 F.2d 70 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1964); Self v. Hanson, 305 F.2d 699 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1962); Hastorf-Nettles, Inc. v. Pillsbury, 203 F.2d 641 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1953). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince we believe that the Deputy Commissioner and District Court properly applied the Brown-Pacific-Maxon standard, and since we deem it necessary to preserve the integrity of the administrative process established by Congress to effectuate the statutory scheme, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.\n\nEcker was employed in Seoul, Korea, as an assistant administrative officer for Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., an engineering management concern working under contracts with the United States and Korean Governments. His duties were restricted to Seoul where he was responsible for personnel in the stenographic and clerical departments. He was subject to call at the job site at any time, but the usual work week was 44 hours, and employees were accustomed to travel far from the job site on weekends and holidays for recreational purposes. Ecker did not live at the job site; he was given an allowance to live on the economy in Seoul. On his Memorial Day weekend he went to a lake 30 miles east of Seoul where a friend of his (not a co-employee) had a house. Ecker intended to spend the holiday there with his friend and another visitor. Their Saturday afternoon project was to fill in the beach in front of the house with sand, but none was readily available. In order to obtain it the three crossed the lake in a small aluminum boat to a sandy part of the shore. There they filled the boat with a load of sand, intending to transport it back to the house. The return trip, however, put Archimedes' Principle to the test; in the middle of the lake the boat capsized and sank. Two of the three men drowned, including Ecker. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,\n1\n as extended by the Defense Bases Act,\n2\n provides workmen's compensation for any\n\n\"accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment, and such occupational disease or infection as arises naturally out of such employment or as naturally or unavoidably results from such accidental injury, and includes an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment.\" 33 U.S.C. 902 (2).\n\n\n The Court holds, per curiam, that Ecker died in the course of his employment. I see no meaningful interpretation of the statute which will support this result except a rule that any decision made by a Deputy Commissioner must be upheld (compare Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\n). That interpretation, although meaningful, is unsupportable.\n\nO'Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., \n340 \nU.S. 504\n, relied upon by the Court, did not establish such a rule. The Court there upheld a compensation award arising from the accidental death of an employee of a government contractor on the island of Guam. The employer maintained for its employees a recreation center near the shoreline along which ran a very dangerous channel. After spending the afternoon at the employer's recreation center, and while waiting for the employer's bus, the employee heard cries for help from two men in trouble in the channel. He drowned in his attempt to rescue them. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court, stated the standard of coverage as:\n\n\"All that is required is that the `obligations or conditions' of employment create the `zone of special \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n danger' out of which the injury arose.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 507\n.\n\n\n That language was intended to mean only that where the employer had placed a facility for employees in an especially dangerous location and thus had created a danger of accidents, a \"reasonable rescue attempt\" could be \"one of the risks of the employment.\" This was made crystal clear by the caveat: \"We hold only that rescue attempts such as that before us are not necessarily excluded from the coverage of the Act as the kind of conduct that employees engage in as frolics of their own.\" Ibid.\n\nHe went on to state that the standard of review to be applied to the Deputy Commissioner's finding that the employee died in the course of his employment was the same as that set out in Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n, for review of Labor Board decisions. Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote both Universal Camera and Brown-Pacific-Maxon, and delivered the opinions on the same day. Reliance upon Universal Camera in Brown-Pacific-Maxon shows beyond doubt that the Court was not establishing a rule that any compensation award by a Deputy Commissioner would be automatically upheld, for it was the whole purpose of Universal Camera to effectuate congressional intent that the courts expand their scope of review over administrative decisions. That opinion defined judicial responsibility for examining the whole record in Labor Board cases, and not just those parts of the record which tended to support the Board. It remains today as the leading judicial guide for administrative review, and the most prominent directive to lower courts not to underestimate their responsibilities in this regard. I think it untenable to read a case which purports to apply the Universal Camera standard of review as embodying a philosophy of judicial abdication. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI read Brown-Pacific-Maxon to mean that some questions of application of \"arising out of and in the course of employment\" to the facts of a case will be left to the discretion of the administrator, and review of his decision treated as review of a finding of fact. The cases in which this limited review of the administrator's decision is appropriate are those in which one application of the statute to the external facts of the case effectuates the judicially recognizable purpose of the statute as well as another. Dominion over the broad or clear purposes of the statute thus remains firmly in the courts' hands, while within the confines of such statutory purposes, administrators are left discretion to provide the intimate particularizations of statutory application.\n3\n Brown-Pacific-Maxon is illustrative. The employee drowned in a particularly treacherous channel with which his job brought him into proximity. The danger was not great that circumstance would force him to swim in the channel, but the danger existed and was peculiar to the locality to which his job brought him; and it was out of this special danger that the employee's injury arose. This, taken together with the other elements of job connection which the administrator thought relevant, rendered an award in the case consistent with the broad purposes of the compensation statute. Yet had the Deputy Commissioner come out the other way, I think that his decision would have been equally supportable. Although it was true that the injury was related to an especially dangerous channel with which the employee's job brought him into proximity, the administrator could have ruled that the danger, although special, was so remote that the connection between the job and the injury was not sufficient to justify compensation. Either result would have been \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n consistent with the statutory purpose of compensating all job-connected injuries on the actual job site and, additionally, those injuries off the job site which result from the \"special\" dangers of the employment. In the sense that both results would have been supportable, the review of the choice actually made by the Deputy Commissioner was treated as review of a finding of fact.\n\nIn the case before us, the Deputy Commissioner's ruling is not consistent with the statutory purpose. The injury did not take place on the actual job site, and it did not arise out of any special danger created by the job. In no sense can it be said that Ecker's job created any \"special\" danger of his drowning in a lake, or more particularly of his loading a small boat with sand and capsizing it. Nothing indicates that the lake was rougher, the boat tippier, or the sand heavier than their counterparts in the United States. If there were \"exacting and unconventional conditions\" in Korea it does not appear that the lake, boat, or sand was one of them. There is nothing more than a \"but for\" relationship between the accident and the employment. To permit the award of compensation to stand reads the \"job-connected\" emphasis right out of the statute, an emphasis which is clearly there. Only injuries \"arising out of\" the employment are compensated. A disease or infection is covered if it arises \"naturally out of such employment.\" Injuries willfully inflicted by third persons upon an employee are covered only if inflicted \"because of his employment.\" A \"but for\" relationship between the injury and the employment should not in itself be sufficient to bring about coverage.\n\nWhether the injury is compensable should depend to some degree on the cause of the injury as well as the time of day, location, and momentary activity of the employee at the time of the accident. I would distinguish between \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n a case in which Ecker smashed his hand in a filing cabinet while at the office and one in which he tripped over a pebble while off on a weekend hike. In the first case Ecker's injury would have arisen out of and in the course of his employment, whereas the statute would not apply to the second case unless the injury were traceable to some special danger peculiar to the employment, which was clearly not the case. Thus, if while off on that same weekend hike Ecker stepped on a mine left over from the Korean conflict, a different result could follow.\n\nThis view of the statute makes far more sense to me than the view adopted by the Court as indicated by the result in this case and its approving citation of such cases as Self v. Hanson, 305 F.2d 699, and Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Hearne, 335 F.2d 70, cert. denied today. It is difficult to determine just what such cases stand for. In Self v. Hanson, for instance, Miss Williams was in the company of a gentleman in a pick-up truck parked at the end of a breakwater on Guam Island at 11 o'clock in the evening. The gentleman said that he wanted to show her a ship in the harbor. Apparently they had been looking at it for over half an hour when the driver of another vehicle on the breakwater lost control and ran into the pick-up truck, causing Miss Williams spinal injuries. The Ninth Circuit upheld the Deputy Commissioner's ruling that she was injured in the course of her employment as a secretary on a Guam defense project.\n\nTo permit compensation for such injuries is to impose absolute liability upon the employer for any and all injuries, whatever their nature, whatever their cause, just so long as the Deputy Commissioner makes an award and the job location is one to which the reviewing judge would not choose to go if he had his choice of vacation spots. Before setting its stamp of approval on such an interpretation of the statute, the Court at the very least should \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n hear argument and receive briefs on the merits. The Solicitor General has pointed out that \"there are several thousands of injury cases reported annually\" under this Act.\n4\n He urged that this question be definitively resolved by this Court. Because of the importance placed by all parties upon resolution of the proper application of the Act to these cases, and because I do not believe Brown-Pacific-Maxon, supra, dictates the Court's result, I respectfully dissent from its decision to treat O'Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., summarily, from its decision on the merits in that case, and from its denial of certiorari in Pan-American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Hearne, No. 474, and Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. O'Keeffe, No. 852.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.

Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474, 490\n, of review by Courts of Appeals of decisions of the National Labor Relations Board, should be applicable here:\n\n\"Reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function. Congress has imposed on them responsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds. That responsibility is not less real because it is limited to enforcing the requirement that evidence appear substantial when viewed, on the record as a whole, by courts invested with the authority and enjoying the prestige of the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 359, 372]\n\u00a0\n Courts of Appeals. The Board's findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board's decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\"\n\n\n Applying that test I would not be inclined to reverse a Court of Appeals that disagreed with a Deputy Commissioner over findings as exotic as we have here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] These problems are unlike those under the Federal Employers' Liability Act where suits can be brought both in state and in federal courts (45 U.S.C. 56) and where the law, poorly received by the judiciary, has been severely eroded.

COMMISSIONER(1965)\nNo. 134\nArgued: March 8, 1965Decided: April 28, 1965\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 237, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Merritt et al, also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n Petitioner Paragon Jewel Coal Company (Paragon), lessee of coal lands, made substantial investments preparatory to the mining of the coal but made agreements with contract miners who were actually to mine the coal at their own expense and deliver it to Paragon at a price per ton to be fixed by Paragon. The coal was mined by drift-mining, a costly and time-consuming process. All equipment used by the miners except buildings and connecting roadways could be removed, and several miners, who were not bound to continue, sold their equipment to others. The miners paid nothing for the privilege of mining, they acquired no title to the coal before or after mining, and they took depreciation on their equipment. Both Paragon and the mining contractors claimed a depletion deduction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 611 and 613 in computing income taxes, but the Commissioner disallowed both claims. The Tax Court held that Paragon was entitled to the entire depletion allowance. Although on appeal the Commissioner then contended that the Tax Court result was right, the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: Depletion deductions are allowed only to the owner of an economic interest in the mineral deposits. Pp. 631-638.\n\n (a) Under 611 (b), read in the light of 631 (c), the lessee in a typical lessor-lessee arrangement is entitled to the entire depletion allowance on the gross income from the property. Pp. 632-633.\n\n\n (b) Parsons v. Smith, \n359 \nU.S. 215, 225\n, sets forth factors to be considered in determining whether contract miners have an economic interest in the coal in place, which are applicable here. Pp. 633-634.\n\n\n (c) A Treasury Regulation buttresses this conclusion. It provides that an agreement between the owner of an economic interest and another entitling the latter to compensation for extraction does \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 625]\n\u00a0\n not of itself convey a depletable economic interest and having survived successive enactments of the Revenue Code the Regulation is entitled to great weight. Pp. 635-636.\n\n\n (d) In addition the subsequent enactment of 631 (c), when contrasted with 631 (b), indicates the intention of Congress that contract coal miners without more are not entitled to a tax allowance. Pp. 636-637.\n\n\n (e) Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308\n, based upon a statute requiring upland drill sites for drilling offshore oil and a lease with upland owners providing for a percentage of net profits, is clearly distinguishable.

Cooper et al., as amici curiae, urging affirmance in No. 237.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issue in these consolidated tax cases is whether the lessee\n1\n of coal lands is entitled to percentage depletion on all the gross income derived from the sale of the coal \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 626]\n\u00a0\n mined from its leases, or whether contract miners who do the actual mining acquired a depletable interest within the meaning of 611 and 613 (b) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to the extent they were paid by the lessee for mining and delivering coal to it.\n\nThe mining contractors, respondents in No. 237, claimed an allocable portion of the allowance for the years 1954 through 1956, while the lessee, petitioner in No. 134, claimed the right to the entire depletion deduction for 1955 through 1957. In each case the deduction was denied the taxpayer. However, the Commissioner now takes the position that the lessee is entitled to the entire allowance;\n2\n the Tax Court so held, 39 T. C. 257, but the Court of Appeals agreed with the contractors. 330 F.2d 161. We granted certiorari in No. 134, \n379 \nU.S. 812\n, and in No. 237, \n379 \nU.S. 886\n, and consolidated them for argument. We have concluded that the Tax Court was correct and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe parties agree that the principles of our opinion in Parsons v. Smith, \n359 \nU.S. 215\n (1959), are controlling here. There we held that the deduction is allowed in recognition of the fact that mineral deposits are wasting assets and that the deduction is intended as compensation to the owner for the part used in production; that there may be more than one depletable interest in the same coal deposit, but that the right to an allocable portion of the allowance depends on the ownership of an economic interest in the coal in place since the statute makes the deduction available only to the owner of a capital interest in such deposit; and, finally, that the legal form of such capital interest is unimportant so long as it constitutes a right with regard to the coal in place. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 627]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe problem arises in applying those principles \"according to the peculiar conditions in each case.\"\n3\n The mining contractors contend that they made a capital investment in the coal in place because of the nature and extent of their expenditures in preparation for and in the performance of oral agreements which they claim granted them the right to mine certain designated areas to exhaustion. They contend that they could only look to the extraction and sale of coal for a return of their investment, and thus that the test of Parsons v. Smith, supra, is satisfied.\n\nParagon, on the other hand, says that Congress never intended for contractors mining coal to have a depletable interest as evidenced by statutory enactments adopted subsequent to the tax years involved in Parsons v. Smith, supra; that in the case of a lease the lessor of coal lands is no longer granted a deduction for depletion but is relegated to capital gains treatment only.\n4\n And, finally, that the expenditures made by the contractors were only for equipment which they depreciated and could not constitute an investment in the coal in place as required under Parsons v. Smith, supra.\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue takes the position that only a taxpayer with a legally enforceable right to share in the value of a mineral deposit has a depletable capital or economic interest in that deposit and the contract miners in this case had no such interest in the unmined coal.\n\n    THE FACTS.\n\n\n Paragon took an assignment of written leases on the coal in and under certain lands which obligated it to pay annual minimum cash royalties, tonnage royalties, land taxes, and to mine all or 85% of the minable coal in the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 628]\n\u00a0\n tracts. It made substantial investments in preparation for processing and marketing the coal, including construction of a tipple, a power line, a railroad siding with four spurs and the purchase of processing equipment. It also built a road from the tipple which circled the mountain close to the outcrop line of coal. This road was used to truck the coal from the contractors' mines to Paragon's tipple.\n\nParagon made oral agreements with various individuals and firms to mine the coal in allocated areas under its leases. They were to mine the coal at their own expense and deliver it to Paragon's tipple at a fixed fee per ton for mining, less 2 1\/2% for rejects. It was understood that this fee might vary from time to time - and it did so - depending somewhat on the general trend of the market price for the coal over extended periods and to some extent on labor costs. However, any changes in the fixed fee were always prospective, the contractors being notified several days in advance of any change so that they always knew the amount they would get for the mining of the coal upon delivery. After delivery to Paragon's tipple the contractor had no further control over the coal, and no responsibility for its sale or in fixing its price. The fixed fee was earned and payable upon delivery and the contractors did not even know the price at which Paragon sold.\n\nThe contractors agreed to buy power at a fixed rate per ton from Paragon's line or put in their own diesel engine generator and compressors. A certain amount per ton was also paid by the contractors for engineering services inside the mine. An engineer provided by Paragon was used to map out or show each of the contractors the particular direction his mine was to take, the locations of adjacent mines, etc. The single engineer was utilized for all of the mines to ensure that they would not run into each other and also so that no minable coal would be \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 629]\n\u00a0\n rendered unrecoverable by haphazard mining methods. Periodically, the engineer would extend his projections of the mine in order to keep it within the contractor's original location.\n\nBecause of the nature of the coal deposits, it was necessary to use the drift-mining method\n5\n which requires the opening of two parallel tunnels, one for ventilation and the other for working space and removal of coal. In this type operation the roof is supported by leaving pillars of coal in place and erecting wooden supports about every 18 inches.\n6\n However, as the miners withdraw from a mine where the coal seam has been exhausted, they take out the wooden supports and also remove the coal pillars, thus recovering the last bit of minable coal. Because of the method used it often takes six to eight weeks to develop a mine to the point where it can be operated profitably.\n\nThe nature of the coal deposits here involved was such that the miners often encountered \"a sandstone roll\" which is an outcrop of rock which \"squeezes\" out the coal. When one of these situations is encountered the miners must move large amounts of rock to reach the coal seam. During this period, of course, they are receiving no money because they are not delivering merchantable coal to Paragon's tipple.\n7\n At other times, water might accumulate which would have to be pumped out before work \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 630]\n\u00a0\n could resume. Again, the contract miners received nothing for this clearing operation.\n\nAfter the coal was removed it was placed in the contractor's bins at the entrance to the mine and was later trucked over a connecting roadway built by the contractor to the adjacent road of Paragon and then taken to the latter's tipple. Paragon took all of the merchantable coal mined. If its facilities were full at the moment the contractor would fill his own bins and then shut down his mine. The record shows no deliveries by the contractors to anyone other than Paragon.\n\nAlthough there was nothing said at the time of the oral contracts regarding who was to receive the depletion, the Tax Court found that Paragon expected to receive that deduction and had fixed its per-ton fee for mining with this in mind. The contracts were also silent regarding termination and were apparently for an indefinite period. However, numerous contractors quit mining, and some sold their equipment, buildings, tracks, etc., to others. Under the agreements, those ceasing to operate could not remove the buildings, but could remove all other equipment. It was anticipated that the contractors would continue mining in their allocated areas as long as it was profitable and so long as proper mining methods were used and the coal met Paragon's standards. However, the contractors were under no obligation to mine any specific amount of coal and were not specifically given the right to mine any particular area to exhaustion.\n\nThe contractors paid nothing for the privilege of mining the coal; they acquired no title to the coal either in place or after it was mined; they paid none of the royalty or land taxes required by Paragon's leases; they claim no sublease, no co-adventure, no partnership. Their sole claim to any interest in the coal in place is based on their investment in equipment, connecting roadways, buildings and the costs of opening the mine, and, in some instances, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 631]\n\u00a0\n on their installation of track inside the mine to remove the coal. They admit, however, that all of this was removable, save the buildings and the connecting roadways, neither of which represented any appreciable expenditure. All of their expenditures were deducted either as direct costs, development costs, depreciation of equipment or capital assets.\n\nOn the basis of these facts the Tax Court concluded as a matter of law that the contractors did not have a depletable interest under their contracts. The Court of Appeals accepted all of the Tax Court's findings but held that the latter erred in its conclusions. It reversed on the basis that the contractors were \"performing Paragon's obligation under its leases and this constituted ample consideration\" together with their \"continuing right to produce the coal and to be paid therefor at a price which was closely related to the market price\" to give them \"an economic interest in the mineral [bringing] them within the rationale of Parsons v. Smith . . . .\" At 163. We believe that the Court of Appeals was in error in so doing.\n\n  STATUTORY PROVISIONS FOR COAL DEPLETION.\n\n\n This Court has often said that the purpose of the allowance for depletion is to compensate the owner of wasting mineral assets for the part exhausted in production, so that when the minerals are gone, the owner's capital and his capital assets remain unimpaired. United States v. Cannelton Sewer Pipe Co., \n364 \nU.S. 76, 81\n (1960). Percentage depletion first came into the tax structure in 1926 and has been consistently regarded as a matter of legislative grace.\n8\n We, therefore, must look to the Code provisions and regulations in effect during the years involved to determine whether these contract coal miners acquired a depletable interest in the coal in place. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 632]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 611 (a) provides for \"a reasonable allowance for depletion . . . according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary . . . .\" The pertinent regulation states:\n\n\"(1) Annual depletion deductions are allowed only to the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or standing timber. An economic interest is possessed in every case in which the taxpayer has acquired by investment any interest in mineral in place or standing timber and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the mineral or severance of the timber, to which he must look for a return of his capital. But a person who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit or standing timber does not possess an economic interest merely because through a contractual relation he possess[es] a mere economic or pecuniary advantage derived from production. For example, an agreement between the owner of an economic interest and another entitling the latter to purchase or process the product upon production or entitling the latter to compensation for extraction or cutting does not convey a depletable economic interest. . . .\" Treas. Reg. 1.611-1 (b) (1).\n\n\n Section 611 (b) establishes an equitable apportionment of such allowance between the lessor and the lessee in the case of a lease. However, 611 (b) must now be read in light of 631 (c)\n9\n which provides that an owner who disposes of coal under any form of contract in which he retains an economic interest shall not receive percentage depletion, but instead must take capital gains treatment for the royalties received under that contract. The result of this in the typical lessor-lessee situation is that the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 633]\n\u00a0\n lessee is entitled to the entire depletion allowance on the gross income from the property. Respondent contract miners make no contention that they are lessees or the sublessees of Paragon.\n\nHowever, they claim that they are entitled to a portion of the percentage depletion because they have somehow acquired an economic interest in the coal in place. This test was first enunciated in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n (1933), and has since become the touchstone of decisions determining the eligibility of a party to share in the depletion allowance. The contract miners contend that their investments of time and money in developing these mines bring them within the meaning of our cases. We believe that Parsons v. Smith, supra, completely settles this question against them.\n\nIn Parsons, the Court enumerated seven factors to be considered in determining whether the coal-mining contracts there involved gave the contract miners any capital investment or economic interest in the coal in place. They were:\n\n\"(1) that [the contract miners'] investments were in their equipment, all of which was movable - not in the coal in place; (2) that their investments in equipment were recoverable through depreciation - not depletion; (3) that the contracts were completely terminable without cause on short notice; (4) that the landowners did not agree to surrender and did not actually surrender to [the contract miners] any capital interest in the coal in place; (5) that the coal at all times, even after it was mined, belonged entirely to the landowners, and that [the contract miners] could not sell or keep any of it but were required to deliver all that they mined to the landowners; (6) that [the contract miners] were not to have any part of the proceeds of the sale of the coal, but, on the contrary, they were to be paid a fixed sum for \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 634]\n\u00a0\n each ton mined and delivered . . .; and (7) that [the contract miners], thus, agreed to look only to the landowners for all sums to become due them under their contracts.\" At 225.\n\n\n The Tax Court found all of these factors present in this case and ruled therefore that Parsons controlled.\n\nThe Court of Appeals agreed with the contractors' position and held, contrary to the Tax Court, that the contracts under which they mined the coal were not terminable at the will of Paragon but gave the contractors \"a continuing right to produce the coal and to be paid therefor at a price which was closely related to the market price.\" It based its decision on the fact that the operators made \"large expenditures of time and money in preparing their respective sites for mining\" and that \"[i]t would be inequitable indeed to hold that Paragon might . . . then take the benefit of the operators' efforts at will and without cause.\" At 163. We regret that we are unable to agree.\n\nIn Parsons the contract was expressly terminable on short notice; here no specific right to terminate was mentioned in the agreement between the parties. However, as the Court of Appeals noted, \"the contracts did not fix upon the operators an obligation to mine to exhaustion.\" In fact, many of them quit at any time they chose. We are unable to say that it is any more inequitable to allow Paragon to terminate the contracts at will than it is to allow the contractors to terminate work and thereby impose upon Paragon the obligation to get other people to work the mine or forfeit its right under the leases.\n\nIn any event, the right to mine even to exhaustion, without more, does not constitute an economic interest under Parsons, but is \"a mere economic advantage derived from production, through a contractual relation to the owner, by one who has no capital investment in the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 635]\n\u00a0\n mineral deposit.\" Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 367\n (1938).\n\nThe court below also indicated that it disagreed with the conclusion of the Tax Court that Paragon could set the price at any level it chose under the agreements. It stated that the contractors were \"to be paid therefor at a price which was closely related to the market price.\" The conclusion of the Tax Court was that while the fee varied somewhat with labor costs, \"there [was] no evidence that the amount paid by Paragon was directly related either to the price it was getting for the coal or to the sales price of a particular contractor's coal, and the amount was apparently changeable at the will of Paragon.\" (Emphasis supplied.) 39 T. C., at 282. After an examination of the entire record, we can only conclude that Paragon at all times retained the right to change its fixed fee at will, and after delivery to the tipple, the contractors could only rely on Paragon's personal covenant to pay the posted price. This is insufficient. As we said in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n (1933), the deduction is allowed only to one who \"has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Here, Paragon was bound to pay the posted fee regardless of the condition of the market at the time of the particular delivery and thus the contract miners did not look to the sale of the coal for a return of their investment, but looked solely to Paragon to abide by its covenant.\n\nThis construction of the Act as to coal depletion is buttressed by the language of the Treasury Regulations which, by example, specifically provide that \"an agreement between the owner of an economic interest and another entitling the latter to . . . compensation for extraction \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 636]\n\u00a0\n . . . does not convey a depletable economic interest.\" This language was taken almost verbatim from Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 367\n (1938), and incorporated in the first regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and since that time there have been no major changes in the economic-interest-versus-economic-advantage paragraph. Compare Treas. Reg. 103, 19.23 (m)-1; Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (m)-1; and Treas. Reg. 118, 39.23 (m)-1 (a)-(b), with Treas. Reg. 1.611-1 (b) (1). This Regulation has survived through successive amendments of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore is entitled to great weight.\n\nFurther, we believe that additional support is given to our construction by subsequent statutory enactments. As noted above, an owner who by contract disposes of the coal in place while retaining an economic interest is relegated to capital gains treatment of the royalties received. However, exemptive language in 631 (c)\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 637]\n\u00a0\n excludes an owner who is also a co-adventurer, partner or principal in the mining of coal, thus permitting such an owner to secure percentage depletion. \"Owner\" is defined for purposes of this subsection as \"any person who owns an economic interest in coal in place, including a sublessor.\" (Emphasis supplied.) While Paragon is certainly an owner of an economic interest in the coal, it is also a principal in the mining of coal and thus comes within the exemption and is expressly allowed depletion. The contract miners do not claim, nor will the record support a contention, that they are a \"co-adventurer, partner, or principal.\" In contrast to the language of 631 (c), it is noted that in treating with timber in 631 (b) an \"owner\" is allowed capital gains instead of depletion. In this instance \"owner\" is defined to be \"any person who owns an interest in such timber, including a sublessor and a holder of a contract to cut timber.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This last phrase as to contractors is not included in 631 (c) thus indicating that as to coal, \"owner\" does not include contract coal miners. Clearly the Congress knew what language to use when it wished to give a contractor a tax allowance. It gave holders of contracts to cut timber capital gains treatment in 631 (b) but did not so provide for contract coal miners in 631 (c).\n\nNor does the opinion in Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308\n (1956), undercut our conclusion. There the State of California required that the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 638]\n\u00a0\n State's offshore oil might be extracted only from wells drilled on filled lands or slant drilled from upland drill sites to the submerged oil deposits. Pursuant to that statute Southwest entered into an agreement with upland owners whereby in the event it was awarded a lease by the State it was given the right to use the surface of the upland as a base for its derrick and drilling operation in reaching the leased oil premises. In consideration of this use Southwest assigned to the upland owners, 24 1\/2% of the net profits derived from the oil recovered. This agreement was the sine qua non of Southwest's securing a lease to drill the submerged land from the State. We held that Southwest's right to drill being expressly conditioned by law upon the agreements with the upland owners made the latter essential parties to the lease from the State and was a sufficient investment by them in the obtaining of the lease to give them an economic interest in the oil in place, which investment was recoverable solely through the extraction of the oil to which they had to look for the return of their investment. Here we have no such statute; the contractors had no part whatever in the lease but were wholly disassociated from it; no fixed percentage of the net income from Paragon's lease was assigned to the contractors; and the latter did not look to the coal but to Paragon for their payment.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons the judgment is reversed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Paragon Jewel Coal Co. was actually an assignee or sublessee of the coal lands in this particular case. However, this is a factual matter without significance here, and for purposes of convenience it will be referred to as the lessee throughout the opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commissioner took a neutral position in the Tax Court, but contended before the Court of Appeals, as he does here, that the lessee is entitled to the depletion deduction on all the gross income derived from the sale of coal mined from its leases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] I. R. C. 1954, 611, 26 U.S.C. 611 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] I. R.

Such owner shall not be entitled to the allowance for percentage depletion provided in section 613 with respect to such coal.

It is interesting to note that when 631 (c) was amended in 1964 to include domestic iron ore Congress did not change the language of this section to also include those mining such ore or coal under a contract since it had made provision for such contractors in 631 (b) dealing with timber.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] We said in Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., supra, at 317: \"We decide only that where, in the circumstances of this case, a party essential to the drilling for and extraction of oil has made an indispensable contribution of the use of real property adjacent to the oil deposits in return for a share in the net profits from the production of oil, that party has an economic interest which entitles him to depletion on the income thus received.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 639]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\nI respectfully dissent. I cannot accept the Court's formalistic view of the depletion provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 611, 613, and 614, which, as applied to this case, would give the entire depletion allowance to Paragon, the lessee of the coal-bearing land. I cannot agree with the Court's decision that a lessee of mineral lands, whose total investment may consist merely of a promise to pay a small royalty for minerals produced, is entitled to the full allowance for depletion and that no share of this allowance is to be apportioned to a mining company with substantial investment in digging and maintaining a particular coal mine. I believe that the issue in this case is basically a simple one: For purposes of the depletion allowance under the Internal Revenue Code, should the mine operators here be viewed as independent contractors selling their services to Paragon, the lessee, or should they be viewed as entrepreneurs participating in a type of joint venture to which Paragon contributes its lease of the land and certain necessary equipment and for which the mine operators provide the other investment necessary to open and run the mines? A look through the formal legal arrangements to the underlying economic realities makes clear that the position of the miners is far closer to that of the entrepreneur participating in a joint venture than to that of a seller of services. For this reason I would hold that the miners have \"an economic interest in the . . . [mineral], in place, which is depleted by production,\" Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n, and they are therefore entitled to a fairly proportioned share of the depletion allowance.\n\nThe factual situation presented by this case is far different from that considered by the Court in Parsons v. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 640]\n\u00a0\n Smith, \n359 \nU.S. 215\n. Parsons held that persons contracting with the owners of coal-bearing land to strip-mine the land were not entitled to an allowance for depletion. Parsons involved comparatively little investment in any particular mines. The coal was obtained through a strip-mining process which consists of removing the earth which lies over the coal, and then removing the coal uncovered. The entire investment of petitioners in Parsons took the form of equipment, such as mechanical shovels, trucks and bulldozers, which \"was movable and usable elsewhere in strip mining and . . . for other purposes.\" Parsons v. Smith, supra, at 219. In fact, one of petitioners in Parsons was primarily a road-building firm. It insisted upon a contract terminable by either party on 10 days' notice since, \"`. . . if an opportunity opened up, [it] wanted to go back to road building,'\" id., at 216, for which its shovels and bulldozers were primarily designed. The contracts of both petitioners in Parsons were made terminable on very short notice. Thus the strippers in Parsons were clearly independent contractors hired to do the stripping, not entrepreneurs with a fixed investment in a particular mine.\n\nOn the other hand, the mines here involved were not strip mines but deep underground mines. The mine operators in the instant case had to use a drift, rather than a strip, method of mining. Unlike a strip-mine contractor, who can begin full production immediately upon removal of the overburden with one employee and a mechanical shovel, the drift-mine operators here had to employ a number of miners and spend many months opening the underground mines. The operations of the miners here included cutting shafts, building a railroad spur, opening ventilation tunnels, shoring the roof of the mine, removing rock and unmarketable coal, and developing entries, cross sections, rooms and air courses, etc. Normally six to eight weeks was required before any marketable \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 641]\n\u00a0\n coal was reached and several months before the mine reached the production\n1\n stage. Moreover, even after the production stage was reached, the miners had to face and prepare pillars of coal for support, and frequently they spent many weeks excavating worthless \"rolls\" of nonmarketable rock or removing excess water from the mines. All this activity required considerable capital investment.\n\nKyva and Standard, the two partnerships of mine operators involved here, state without challenge that as of the end of 1956, they had invested in machinery, $33,263.81 and $26,901.30, respectively. Their expenses during their first year of operation were, respectively, $76,036.64 and $73,214.02. This expense was primarily capital expense representing investment in the mine, making it ready for exploitation of the coal in place. Unlike Parsons where the bulldozers, trucks and shovels were movable and primarily designed for road building and other work, the major part of the mine operators' capital investment here consisted of labor costs and was usable only in this particular underground mine operation. The mine operators could look for a return of their investment only to sales of the coal which they were to mine. Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that Paragon's contracts with the operators were not terminable at will or upon short notice, and that \"the operators had a continuing right to produce the coal and to be paid therefor at a price which was closely related to the market price.\" 330 F.2d 161, 163. Under these circumstances I believe it undeniable that the operators invested considerable time, labor, and equipment in the coal in place. In order to extract the mineral, they pooled their resources, funds, and energies with Paragon, which supplied its base interest and made other investment necessary \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 642]\n\u00a0\n for processing and marketing the coal. I would hold, with the Court of Appeals, that the operators as well as Paragon fit within the rule enunciated in Palmer v. Bender, supra, and followed in other cases,\n2\n and that they had an economic interest in the mineral in place which entitled them to an allowance for depletion.\n\nThe Court tries to assimilate this case to Parsons by stating that Paragon could have terminated the interest of the operators in the coal at any time and that the operators had no right to mine their coal veins to exhaustion. The actual facts, however, reveal that Paragon has never taken steps, nor given the slightest intimation that it might take steps, to terminate anyone's contract. As a matter of practical fact the operators could count on mining the coal vein so long as coal remained and selling that coal to Paragon at a rate which varied slightly with the market price of coal. Additionally, the Court of Appeals found that the operators had \"a right to mine to exhaustion,\" and a \"continuing right to produce the coal and to be paid therefor at a price which was closely related to the market price.\" 330 F.2d, at 163. Whether or not the actions of the parties would produce these legal results is, of course, a question of state law. And, it is a clear rule of long standing that this Court, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, accepts the determinations of the Court of Appeals, the members of which are closer to the local scene than we, on questions of local law. General Box Co. v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 159, 165\n; Allegheny County v. Frank Mashuda Co., \n360 \nU.S. 185, 191\n; Ragan v. Merchants Transfer Co., \n337 \nU.S. 530, 534\n. Moreover, in view of the operators' considerable investment in the mines and their substantial reliance on being \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 643]\n\u00a0\n able to work those mines, I should be most surprised were state courts, contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, to allow Paragon to terminate the contracts at will or to lower drastically the price it paid for the coal deliberately in order to drive particular operators out of business. Thus this case differs from Parsons not only because here the operators had a substantial fixed and unmovable investment in each particular mine, but also because here the operators had a right to mine the coal until it was exhausted in order to attempt to recover their investment and make a profit. In Parsons, as I have noted, it was the strip operator itself which insisted upon terminability so that it would be free to move its equipment to more profitable and unrelated opportunities.\n\nThe Court, in reaching its result, relies upon Treasury Regulations 1.611-1 (b) (1) and Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362\n. With all deference I do not believe that either the regulation or Bankline Oil bears significantly upon the issue here presented. The regulation in its entirety makes clear that \"[a]n economic interest is possessed in every case in which the taxpayer has acquired by investment any interest in mineral in place . . . and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the mineral . . . . But a person who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit . . . does not possess an economic interest merely because through a contractual relation he possess[es] a mere economic or pecuniary advantage derived from production.\"\n3\n The regulation thus indicates that the question \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 644]\n\u00a0\n to be asked is whether the mine operators have a significant investment in the coal in place. I think it clear from the facts I have recited that their investment has given them an economic interest in the coal. Bankline Oil held that a processor of natural gas who received the gas at the mouth of the well and \"`. . . had no enforceable rights whatsoever under its contracts prior to the time the wet gas was actually placed in its pipe line,'\" \"had no capital investment in the mineral deposit,\" for he \"had no interest in the gas in place.\" \n303 \nU.S., at 368\n. The facts that \"the taxpayer's capital investment was in equipment facilitating delivery of the gas produced rather than in equipment for production of gas, . . . that its function was not production of gas but the processing of gas,\" G. C. M. 22730, 1941-1 Cum. Bull. 214, 220, and that the taxpayer had no enforcible right to receive any gas from the well,\n4\n all adequately distinguish Bankline Oil from the case here before us.\n\nFurther, I find this case virtually indistinguishable from Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308\n. In Southwest Exploration, owners of uplands next to offshore oil drilling sites allowed drillers to use their land as a base for offshore drilling operations in return \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 645]\n\u00a0\n for 24 1\/2% of the net profits derived from the oil recovered. Though no oil lay under the owners' land, under California law offshore oil could be extracted only from filled lands or by slant drilling from upland drill sites. The Court held, because the owners of the upland sites had contributed the use of their land, necessary for the extraction of the oil, in return for a share in the net profits from the production of oil, that they had \"an economic interest which entitle[d] . . . [them] to depletion on the income thus received.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 317\n. The coal mine operators in this case made as significant an investment in the mine as did the upland owners in Southwest Exploration. Their contribution was as necessary for the extraction of the coal as was the land for the extraction of the oil. They were as dependent upon the coal for the recoupment of their investment as were the landowners upon the oil. Though the mine operators had little control over who bought the coal, there is no indication that the landowners had any control over who bought the oil. And the mine operators made a substantial investment in the mine - not an investment in machinery which could be moved from place to place or mine to mine, but a fixed investment of time and labor in opening and developing the mine. The coal mine operators could look only to a sale of the coal for the return of their investment.\n\nThe Court also attempts to draw support from 631 (b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as showing a congressional intent not to allow mine operators to share in the depletion allowance. These sections, however, have nothing to do with the issue of apportioning the depletion allowance here under consideration. They state only that the holders of certain passive kinds of income interest, such as royalty interests in coal like that of the lessor in this case - interests quite unlike those owned either by Paragon or the mine operators here - will not receive any allowance for depletion but instead \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 646]\n\u00a0\n will receive capital gains treatment for their income. See S. Rep. No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 43. Section 631 (b), a rather lengthy subsection, provides capital gains treatment for the income of certain passive owners of timber interests and states in part that \"[f]or purposes of this subsection, the term `owner' means any person who owns an interest in such timber, including a sublessor and a holder of a contract to cut timber.\" This definition, by its very terms, applies only to 631 (b), a section with no bearing on the question at issue here. Section 631 (c), also a lengthy subsection, provides for capital gains treatment for income arising from coal royalties. To make certain that only passive holders of royalties received capital gains treatment and that holders of working interests did not receive capital gains treatment but instead received a depletion allowance, Congress specifically excluded holders of working interests from the coverage of 631 (c). Congress stated that certain owners of royalty interests would receive capital gains treatment, but stated that \"[t]his subsection shall not apply to income realized by any owner as a co-adventurer, partner, or principal in the mining of such coal, and the word `owner' means any person who owns an economic interest in coal in place, including a sublessor.\" This definition is meant to exclude from the coverage of 631 (c) not only mine operators, but also lessees such as Paragon, whose income does not arise from passive royalties. In my view, this sentence adequately does the job Congress intended for it to do, for the income of both mine operators and lessees falls within the scope of \"income realized by any owner as a co-adventurer, partner, or principal in the mining of such coal.\" See S. Rep. No. 781, supra, at 43.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 647]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven were I to assume that the definitions of \"owner\" in 631 (b) and (c) have a more direct bearing upon 611, 613, and 614, the sections dealing with the depletion allowance, 631 (b) and (c) would not show that Congress did not intend to grant contract miners for coal any depletion allowance. \"[A] holder of a contract to cut timber\" may well have been included specifically in 631 (b)'s definition because Congress wished to make crystal clear that all holders of contracts to cut timber were to receive capital gains treatment for their income. See H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 59. Congress may not have included a similar provision in 631 (c) because it did not believe that the strip miner, whose function is similar to that of the holder of a contract to cut timber, should be brought within the coverage of 631 (c); or Congress may have felt that since lessees such as Paragon were not included within the coverage of 631 (c), holders of contracts to mine coal should similarly not have their income treated as a capital gain; or the issue of according capital gains treatment to the income of contract mine operators might not have been before the Committee when 631 was being drafted. If 631 (b) and (c) have any relevance to this case, it must be in the fact that 631 (c) defines an owner as a person \"who owns an economic interest in coal in place\" (emphasis added), thus indicating a specific congressional intent that formal legal ownership of the mineral should not be controlling.\n\nFinally, it is argued that the operators were able to recover their investments through depreciation and to allow them depletion as well would be to permit a double recovery of their costs. This argument overlooks the fact that Paragon too is able to recover every cent of its investment \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 648]\n\u00a0\n through depreciation and amortization allowances in addition to depletion. The only investment made by Paragon which might be considered different in kind from that of the mine operators is Paragon's promise to pay a royalty to its lessors of between 30 and 40 cents per ton of coal.\n6\n This royalty was fully deductible from Paragon's income. Despite the fact that to allow a lessee to share in the depletion allowance is to allow a double deduction, Congress affirmatively stated its intent to allow lessees of land to share in this allowance. See Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 611 (b) (1). Perhaps allowing both a depletion allowance and depreciation is inequitable, but this is a congressional decision which is not for us to question.\n\nI conclude that the depletion allowance should be properly apportioned between the lessee and the coal mine operators. The operators were not employees or independent contractors hired to perform services. Unlike a man hired to mow a lawn, or shovel snow, or strip-mine coal, they made a substantial investment in opening and developing each individual mine and could look only to proceeds of the sale of coal extracted for a return of that investment. Under these circumstances I believe that the operators meet the test of Palmer v. Bender, supra, which undisputedly applies here, for they have \"an economic interest in the . . . [coal], in place, which is depleted by production.\" \n287 \nU.S., at 557\n. While, clearly, the \"phrase `economic interest' is not to be taken as embracing a mere economic advantage derived from production,\" Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, the operators here, unlike the strip miners in Parsons, do not merely derive an economic advantage through production; they also have a substantial capital investment in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 649]\n\u00a0\n the mineral in place. To refuse to recognize this merely because the operators do not hold legal title to the coal is, in my view, a blind following of form, which I cannot accept.\n7\n To hold that the operators here are, in fact, like sellers of services is equally unrealistic. I would accept the sound view of the Court of Appeals - the members of which come from local mining areas - that the operators are substantial investors in the coal, and, in accordance with what I believe to be the intent of Congress, I would require that they be permitted a share of the allowance for depletion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For the applicable definition of production stage, see Treas. Reg. 1.616-2 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, \n328 \nU.S. 25, 32\n; Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, \n326 \nU.S. 599, 603\n; Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 370, 371\n; Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655, 661\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Treas. Reg. 1.611-1 (b) (1) reads as follows: \"Annual depletion deductions are allowed only to the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or standing timber. An economic interest is possessed in every case in which the taxpayer has acquired by investment any interest in mineral in place or standing timber and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the mineral or severance of the timber, to which he \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 644]\n\u00a0\n must look for a return of his capital. But a person who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit or standing timber does not possess an economic interest merely because through a contractual relation he possess[es] a mere economic or pecuniary advantage derived from production. For example, an agreement between the owner of an economic interest and another entitling the latter to purchase or process the product upon production or entitling the latter to compensation for extraction or cutting does not convey a depletable economic interest. Further, depletion deductions with respect to an economic interest of a corporation are allowed to the corporation and not to its shareholders.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals found that the mine operators here had an enforcible right to mine the coal to exhaustion. See discussion, supra, at 642.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Court points out that the mine operators do not claim to be a \"co-adventurer, partner, or principal\" in the mining of the coal. Ante, at 637. The mine operators, however, do claim to be engaged in a type of joint venture with Paragon in mining the coal. It is \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 647]\n\u00a0\n understandable that they do not use the exact language of 631 (c), for that section has no bearing upon the question here at issue: whether they own an economic interest in the coal in place.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Paragon paid the mine operators between $4 and $5 per ton for the coal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Compare this Court's rejection of the argument that only a legal interest can constitute a \"substantial interest\" in a corporation in United States v. Boston & M. R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 157\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 624, 650]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARROT v.

The State filed a petition for forfeiture of the car, which the trial judge, after finding that the officers acted without probable cause, dismissed on the ground that the forfeiture depended on the admission of illegally obtained evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment as applied to the States by the Fourteenth. The State Supreme Court, without reviewing the finding of lack of probable cause, reversed on the basis that the exclusionary rule applies only to criminal prosecutions and not to forfeitures, which it held are civil in nature.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAt approximately 6:30 a. m. on December 16, 1960, two law enforcement officers of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board stationed near Camden, New Jersey, at the approach to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, observed a 1958 Plymouth sedan bearing Pennsylvania license plates proceeding toward the bridge in the direction of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The officers, noting that \"[t]he car was low in the rear, quite low,\" followed it across the bridge into Philadelphia. They stopped the automobile a short distance within the city, identified themselves and questioned the owner, George McGonigle. The officers then searched the car and, in the rear and the trunk, found 31 cases of liquor not bearing Pennsylvania tax seals. The car and liquor were seized and McGonigle was arrested and charged with violation of Pennsylvania law.\n1\n The officers did not have either a search or arrest warrant.\n\nPursuant to a Pennsylvania statute\n2\n the Commonwealth filed a petition for forfeiture of the automobile.\n3\n At the hearing McGonigle, by timely objection, sought dismissal of the forfeiture petition on the ground that the forfeiture of the automobile depended upon the admission \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 695]\n\u00a0\n of evidence illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court sustained this position and dismissed the forfeiture petition. In doing so, the trial judge made a specific finding that \"[t]he seizure was founded upon evidence illegally obtained, since under the particular circumstances the officers acted without probable cause.\"\n4\n The Superior Court of Pennsylvania, an intermediate appellate court, by a 4-to-3 decision reversed the order dismissing the petition and directed that the automobile be forfeited. 199 Pa. Super. 428, 186 A. 2d 52. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the order of the Superior Court, one judge dissenting. 414 Pa. 540, 201 A. 2d 427.\n\nThe basis of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision was that the exclusionary rule, which this Court in Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 657\n, held \"is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments,\" applies only to criminal prosecutions and is not applicable in a forfeiture proceeding which the Pennsylvania court deemed civil in nature. In light of this disposition of the case, the State Supreme Court did not review the trial court's finding of lack of probable cause, stating:\n\n \"The thrust of the arguments, both of the appellant and the Commonwealth, is directed to the validity and propriety of the search and the subsequent seizure by the officers of this Plymouth automobile. In our view, such arguments are beyond the point. By reason of the nature of the present proceeding, i. e., a forfeiture procedure, we consider it unnecessary to determine the propriety and validity of the search and the seizure of this automobile.\" 414 Pa., at 542; 201 A. 2d, at 429. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 696]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 927\n, to consider the important question of whether the constitutional exclusionary rule enunciated in Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, and Mapp applies to forfeiture proceedings of the character involved here - a question on which there has been conflict in both state and federal decisions.\n5\n For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the constitutional exclusionary rule does apply to such forfeiture proceedings and consequently reverse the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nAs this Court has acknowledged, \"[t]he leading case on the subject of search and seizure is Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n.\" Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 147\n. See Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 646-647. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, itself was not a criminal case but was a proceeding by the United States to forfeit 35 cases of plate glass which had allegedly been imported without payment of the customs duty. The District Judge in the case entered an order compelling the owners of the plate glass to produce certain records which would aid the United States in proving its case for forfeiture. The question before the Court in Boyd was whether the compulsory production of a man's private papers for their evidentiary use against him in a proceeding to forfeit his property for alleged fraud against the revenue laws constituted an unreasonable search and seizure within the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 697]\n\u00a0\n meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. In holding that the Fourth Amendment applied and barred such attempted seizure, Mr. Justice Bradley, for the Court stated:\n\n\"We are also clearly of opinion that proceedings instituted for the purpose of declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by reason of offences committed by him, though they may be civil in form, are in their nature criminal. In this very case, the ground of forfeiture as declared in the 12th section of the act of 1874, on which the information is based, consists of certain acts of fraud committed against the public revenue in relation to imported merchandise, which are made criminal by the statute; and it is declared, that the offender shall be fined not exceeding $5000 nor less than $50, or be imprisoned not exceeding two years, or both; and in addition to such fine such merchandise shall be forfeited. These are the penalties affixed to the criminal acts; the forfeiture sought by this suit being one of them. If an indictment had been presented against the claimants, upon conviction the forfeiture of the goods could have been included in the judgment. If the government prosecutor elects to waive an indictment, and to file a civil information against the claimants - that is, civil in form - can he by this device take from the proceeding its criminal aspect and deprive the claimants of their immunities as citizens, and extort from them a production of their private papers, or, as an alternative, a confession of guilt? This cannot be. The information, though technically a civil proceeding, is in substance and effect a criminal one. . . . As, therefore, suits for penalties and forfeitures incurred by the commission of offences against the law, are of this quasi-criminal nature, we think that they are within the reason of criminal proceedings for all \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 698]\n\u00a0\n the purposes of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution . . . .\" Boyd v. United States, supra, at 633-634.\n\n\n This authoritative statement and the holding by the Court in Boyd that the Government could not seize evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment for use in a forfeiture proceeding would seem to be dispositive of this case. The Commonwealth, however, argues that Boyd is factually distinguishable as it involved a subpoena sought by the Government for the production of evidence whereas the issue here is the admissibility of illegally seized evidence already in the Government's possession. Although there is this factual difference between Boyd and the case at bar, nevertheless the basic holding of Boyd applies with equal, if not greater, force to the case before us. In both the Boyd situation and here the essential question is whether evidence - in Boyd the books and records, here the results of the search of the car - the obtaining of which violates the Fourth Amendment may be relied upon to sustain a forfeiture. Boyd holds that it may not.\n\nThe Commonwealth further argues that Boyd's unequivocal statement that the Fourth Amendment applies to forfeiture proceedings as well as criminal prosecutions has been undermined by the statements of this Court in United States v. Jeffers, \n342 \nU.S. 48, 54\n, and Trupiano v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 699, 710\n. Jeffers and Trupiano, unlike Boyd, were not forfeiture cases. They were federal criminal prosecutions. In both cases the Court held that evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was not admissible notwithstanding the fact that the evidence involved was contraband. By way of dictum, however, since the point was not before it, the Court stated in these cases that its ruling that the contraband was excludable as illegally seized did not mean that the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 699]\n\u00a0\n Government was required to return the illegally imported narcotics to Jeffers or the unregistered still, alcohol and mash to Trupiano.\n\nThe nature of the contraband involved in these cases clearly explains these statements of the Court. Both Trupiano and Jeffers concerned objects the possession of which, without more, constitutes a crime.\n6\n The repossession of such per se contraband by Jeffers and Trupiano would have subjected them to criminal penalties. The return of the contraband would clearly have frustrated the express public policy against the possession of such objects. See United States v. Jeffers, supra, at 53-54.\n\nIt is apparent that the nature of the property here, though termed contraband by Pennsylvania, is quite different. There is nothing even remotely criminal in possessing an automobile. It is only the alleged use to which this particular automobile was put that subjects Mr. McGonigle to its possible loss. And it is conceded here that the Commonwealth could not establish an illegal use without using the evidence resulting from the search which is challenged as having been in violation of the Constitution. Furthermore, the return of the automobile to the owner would not subject him to any possible criminal penalties for possession or frustrate any public policy concerning automobiles, as automobiles. This distinction between what has been described as contraband per se and only derivative contraband has indeed been recognized by Pennsylvania itself in its requirement of mandatory forfeiture of illegal liquor, and stills, and only discretionary forfeiture of such things as automobiles illegally used. See Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 47, 6-602 (e) (1964 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 700]\n\u00a0\n Cum. Supp.). We, therefore, do not have a case before us in any way analogous to the contraband involved in Jeffers and Trupiano and these cases can in no way be deemed to impair the continued validity of Boyd which, like this case, involved property not intrinsically illegal in character.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nFinally as Mr. Justice Bradley aptly pointed out in Boyd, a forfeiture proceeding is quasi-criminal in character. Its object, like a criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law. In this case McGonigle, the driver and owner of the automobile, was arrested and charged with a criminal offense against the Pennsylvania liquor laws. The record does not disclose which particular offense or offenses he was charged with committing.\n8\n If convicted of any one of the possible offenses involved, however, he would be subject, if a \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 701]\n\u00a0\n first offender, to a minimum penalty of a $100 fine and a maximum penalty of a $500 fine.\n9\n In this forfeiture proceeding he was subject to the loss of his automobile, which at the time involved had an estimated value of approximately $1,000,\n10\n a higher amount than the maximum fine in the criminal proceeding. It would be anomalous indeed, under these circumstances, to hold that in the criminal proceeding the illegally seized evidence is excludable, while in the forfeiture proceeding, requiring the determination that the criminal law has been violated, the same evidence would be admissible.\n11\n That the forfeiture is clearly a penalty for the criminal offense and can result in even greater punishment than the criminal prosecution has in fact been recognized by the Pennsylvania courts. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 702]\n\u00a0\n In Commonwealth v. One 1959 Chevrolet Impala Coupe, involving a forfeiture in 1962, the Pennsylvania Superior Court in affirming the exercise of discretion to waive a forfeiture following a criminal prosecution, stated:\n\n \"It seemed to the court below that to make this man pay the sum of $500.00 in fines, together with the costs of the proceeding and the storage cost for the automobile, was sufficient punishment under all the circumstances. To forfeit a 1959 Chevrolet Impala coupe in addition to the above seemed to the court below to be entirely out of proportion to the crime involved. We cannot say that the court below abused its discretion in so acting.\" 201 Pa. Super. 145, 150, 191 A. 2d 717, 719.\n\n\n In sum, we conclude that the nature of a forfeiture proceeding, so well described by Mr. Justice Bradley in Boyd, and the reasons which led the Court to hold that the exclusionary rule of Weeks v. United States, supra, is obligatory upon the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, so well articulated by MR. JUSTICE CLARK in Mapp, support the conclusion that the exclusionary rule is applicable to forfeiture proceedings such as the one involved here. This being the case, the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court must be reversed. Our holding frees the Pennsylvania court on remand to review the trial court's finding that the officials did not in this case have probable cause for the search involved, a question which it previously did not consider necessary to decide.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 703]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See note 9, infra, and accompanying text.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Purdon's Pa.

One Ford Coupe Automobile, \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, or Dodge v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 530\n. The question involved in both of these cases was not the introduction of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution but that of whether evidence seized by one without statutory authority could be used when its seizure was later ratified by an official with statutory authority. Indeed in Dodge v. United States, supra, at 532, Mr. Justice Holmes, for the Court, expressly recognized that the case did not involve exclusion of evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure and stated: \"The exclusion of evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure stands on a different ground. If the search and seizure are unlawful as invading personal rights secured by the Constitution those rights would be infringed yet further if the evidence were allowed to be used.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Under Pennsylvania law on the alleged facts of this case, McGonigle presumably could have been charged with violating one or more of the following subsections of Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 47, 4-491: (2) possession or transport of liquor that has not been purchased from a Pennsylvania Liquor Store; (4) possession of untaxed liquor; (11) illegal importation of liquor into the Commonwealth.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 47, 4-494 (a) (1964 Cum. Supp.) provides: \"Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this article, except as otherwise specifically provided, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), and on failure to pay such fine, to imprisonment for not less than one month, nor more than three months, and for any subsequent offense, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not less than three hundred dollars ($300), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), and to undergo imprisonment for a period not less than three months, nor more than one year.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See National Market Reports, Inc., Red Book, Jan. 1-Feb. 14, 1961, Region A, 114.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] This Court in Boyd v. United States, supra, at 638, rejected any argument that the technical character of a forfeiture as an in rem proceeding against the goods had any effect on the right of the owner of the goods to assert as a defense violations of his constitutional rights. The Court stated: \"[A]lthough the owner of goods, sought to be forfeited by a proceeding in rem, is not the nominal party, he is, nevertheless, the substantial party to the suit; he certainly is so, after making claim and defence; and, in a case like the present, he is entitled to all the privileges which appertain to a person who is prosecuted for a forfeiture of his property by reason of committing a criminal offence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The applicable standard of what constitutes probable cause, as stated by MR. JUSTICE CLARK for the Court in Ker v. California, \n374 \nU.S. 23, 33\n, \"is the same under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Cf. Beck v. Ohio, \n379 \nU.S. 89\n; Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108\n; Henry v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 98\n; Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 153\n-154.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nThe language of the Fourth Amendment forbids \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" but it does not expressly or by implication provide that evidence secured in such a way cannot be used in a prosecution against an accused. Congress could, of course, pass a law to preclude the use of evidence so secured in the federal courts, but I do not believe this Court or any other has constitutional power to pass such a law itself. See Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25, 39\n (concurring opinion). For these reasons I cannot agree that because we ourselves might believe the practice of obtaining evidence in that manner \"shocks the conscience\" or is \"shabby\" or \"arbitrary,\" we are commanded or even authorized by the Constitution to prevent its use as evidence. That seems to me to be amending the Constitution, which is the business of the people, not interpreting it, which is the business of the courts. But the Fifth Amendment does specifically provide that \"No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\" and this Court held in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 634\n-635, that \"a compulsory production of the private books and papers of the owner of goods sought to be forfeited in . . . a suit is compelling him to be a witness against himself, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and is the equivalent of a search and seizure - and an unreasonable search and seizure - within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\" Boyd therefore stands for the constitutional principle that evidence secured by unreasonable search and seizure is compelled \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 704]\n\u00a0\n evidence, and is therefore barred from use in criminal cases by the Fifth Amendment's provision that \"No person. . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . .\" See Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 174\n (concurring opinion). The Court in Boyd thus based its exclusion of unlawfully seized evidence squarely on the specific prohibitions of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and not merely on the personal predilections of judges against such use.\n\nThis Court in Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643, 646\n, recognized as the Court had in Boyd that \"the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.\" \n116 \nU.S., at 630\n. At the very outset of its opinion in Mapp this Court relied on and quoted at length from the opinion in the Boyd case, which had relied on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments together to forbid the use in court of evidence obtained through an unreasonable search or seizure. \n367 \nU.S., at 646\n-647. Use of such evidence, the Court said in Mapp, would be \"tantamount to coerced testimony.\" \n367 \nU.S., at 656\n. And we said last Term in Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1, 8\n:\n\n\"Mapp held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination implemented the Fourth Amendment in such cases, and that the two guarantees of personal security conjoined in the Fourteenth Amendment to make the exclusionary rule obligatory on the States. We relied upon the great case of Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n . . . .\"\n\n\n It was because of the Court's reliance on the Boyd doctrine - which held that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments together barred use of unreasonably seized evidence - that I joined the Court's opinion in Mapp. See \n367 \nU.S. 643, 661\n (concurring opinion). And for that same reason I agree with the Court today that the Fourth Amendment's protection against unlawful search and seizure and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 705]\n\u00a0\n the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled testimony apply in forfeiture proceedings like the one here. This was the holding in Boyd, which itself involved a forfeiture proceeding, and I would follow it in forfeiture proceedings as well as in criminal cases. In doing so, I recognize that this interpretation was reached in Boyd on the principle that \"constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed.\" \n116 \nU.S., at 635\n. But that interpretive principle, I think, is a desirable one if our Constitution is to be given its proper place in our Government.\n\nI also agree with the Court that our remand expresses no view as to whether the trial court was correct in its ruling on the issue of probable cause, and that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is free on remand to review the trial court's finding, and that of course, as declared in Mapp, the standard of probable cause is the same in the state courts as in the federal courts.\n\n\n[380 \nU.S. 693, 1]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOINTER v.

With him on the brief were Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of Texas, Hawthorne Phillips, First Assistant Attorney General, Stanton Stone, Executive Assistant Attorney General, and Howard M. Fender and Allo B. Crow, Jr., Assistant Attorneys General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment provides in part that:\n\n \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 401]\n\u00a0\n against him . . . and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"\n\n\n Two years ago in Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n, we held that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of right to counsel obligatory upon the States. The question we find necessary to decide in this case is whether the Amendment's guarantee of a defendant's right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\" which has been held to include the right to cross-examine those witnesses, is also made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe petitioner Pointer and one Dillard were arrested in Texas and taken before a state judge for a preliminary hearing (in Texas called the \"examining trial\") on a charge of having robbed Kenneth W. Phillips of $375 \"by assault, or violence, or by putting in fear of life or bodily injury,\" in violation of Texas Penal Code Art. 1408. At this hearing an Assistant District Attorney conducted the prosecution and examined witnesses, but neither of the defendants, both of whom were laymen, had a lawyer. Phillips as chief witness for the State gave his version of the alleged robbery in detail, identifying petitioner as the man who had robbed him at gunpoint. Apparently Dillard tried to cross-examine Phillips but Pointer did not, although Pointer was said to have tried to cross-examine some other witnesses at the hearing. Petitioner was subsequently indicted on a charge of having committed the robbery. Some time before the trial was held, Phillips moved to California. After putting in evidence to show that Phillips had moved and did not intend to return to Texas, the State at the trial offered the transcript of Phillips' testimony given at the preliminary hearing as evidence against petitioner. Petitioner's counsel immediately objected to introduction of the transcript, stating, \"Your Honor, we will object to that, as it is a denial of the confrontment of the witnesses against the Defendant.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 402]\n\u00a0\n Similar objections were repeatedly made by petitioner's counsel but were overruled by the trial judge, apparently in part because, as the judge viewed it, petitioner had been present at the preliminary hearing and therefore had been \"accorded the opportunity of cross examining the witnesses there against him.\" The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest state court to which the case could be taken, affirmed petitioner's conviction, rejecting his contention that use of the transcript to convict him denied him rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. 375 S. W. 2d 293. We granted certiorari to consider the important constitutional question the case involves. \n379 \nU.S. 815\n.\n\nIn this Court we do not find it necessary to decide one aspect of the question petitioner raises, that is, whether failure to appoint counsel to represent him at the preliminary hearing unconstitutionally denied him the assistance of counsel within the meaning of Gideon v. Wainwright, supra. In making that argument petitioner relies mainly on White v. Maryland, \n373 \nU.S. 59\n, in which this Court reversed a conviction based in part upon evidence that the defendant had pleaded guilty to the crime at a preliminary hearing where he was without counsel. Since the preliminary hearing there, as in Hamilton v. Alabama, \n368 \nU.S. 52\n, was one in which pleas to the charge could be made, we held in White as in Hamilton that a preliminary proceeding of that nature was so critical a stage in the prosecution that a defendant at that point was entitled to counsel. But the State informs us that at a Texas preliminary hearing, such as is involved here, pleas of guilty are not guilty are not accepted and that the judge decides only whether the accused should be bound over to the grand jury and if so whether he should be admitted to bail. Because of these significant differences in the procedures of the respective States, we cannot say that the White case is necessarily controlling \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n as to the right to counsel. Whether there might be other circumstances making this Texas preliminary hearing so critical to the defendant as to call for appointment of counsel at that stage we need not decide on this record, and that question we reserve. In this case the objections and arguments in the trial court as well as the arguments in the Court of Criminal Appeals and before us make it clear that petitioner's objection is based not so much on the fact that he had no lawyer when Phillips made his statement at the preliminary hearing, as on the fact that use of the transcript of that statement at the trial denied petitioner any opportunity to have the benefit of counsel's cross-examination of the principal witness against him. It is that latter question which we decide here.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Sixth Amendment is a part of what is called our Bill of Rights. In Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, in which this Court held that the Sixth Amendment's right to the assistance of counsel is obligatory upon the States, we did so on the ground that \"a provision of the Bill of Rights which is `fundamental and essential to a fair trial' is made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" \n372 \nU.S., at 342\n. And last Term in Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n, in holding that the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, we reiterated the holding of Gideon that the Sixth Amendment's right-to-counsel guarantee is \"`a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,'\" and \"thus was made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" \n378 \nU.S., at 6\n. See also Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, \n378 \nU.S. 52\n. We hold today that the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is likewise a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt cannot seriously be doubted at this late date that the right of cross-examination is included in the right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him. And probably no one, certainly no one experienced in the trial of lawsuits, would deny the value of cross-examination in exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth in the trial of a criminal case. See, e. g., 5 Wigmore, Evidence 1367 (3d ed. 1940). The fact that this right appears in the Sixth Amendment of our Bill of Rights reflects the belief of the Framers of those liberties and safeguards that confrontation was a fundamental right essential to a fair trial in a criminal prosecution. Moreover, the decisions of this Court and other courts\n*\n throughout the years have constantly emphasized the necessity for cross-examination as a protection for defendants in criminal cases. This Court in Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47, 55\n, 56, referred to the right of confrontation as \"[o]ne of the fundamental guarantees of life and liberty,\" and \"a right long deemed so essential for the due protection of life and liberty that it is guarded against legislative and judicial action by provisions in the Constitution of the United States and in the constitutions of most if not of all the States composing the Union.\" Mr. Justice Stone, writing for the Court in Alford v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 687, 692\n, declared that the right of cross-examination is \"one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\" And in speaking of confrontation and cross-examination this Court said in Greene v. McElroy, \n360 \nU.S. 474\n:\n\n\"They have ancient roots. They find expression in the Sixth Amendment which provides that in all \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 405]\n\u00a0\n criminal cases the accused shall enjoy the right `to be confronted with the witnesses against him.' This Court has been zealous to protect these rights from erosion.\" \n360 \nU.S., at 496\n-497 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n There are few subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country's constitutional goal. Indeed, we have expressly declared that to deprive an accused of the right to cross-examine the witnesses against him is a denial of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law. In In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n, this Court said:\n\n\"A person's right to reasonable notice of a charge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense - a right to his day in court - are basic in our system of jurisprudence; and these rights include, as a minimum, a right to examine the witnesses against him, to offer testimony, and to be represented by counsel.\" \n333 \nU.S., at 273\n (footnote omitted).\n\n\n And earlier this Term in Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466, 472\n-473, we held:\n\n \"In the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the `evidence developed' against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant's right of confrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel.\"\n\n\n Compare Willner v. Committee on Character & Fitness, \n373 \nU.S. 96, 103\n-104. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are aware that some cases, particularly West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258, 264\n, have stated that the Sixth Amendment's right of confrontation does not apply to trials in state courts, on the ground that the entire Sixth Amendment does not so apply. See also Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156, 195\n-196. But of course since Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, it no longer can broadly be said that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to state courts. And as this Court said in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, \"The Court has not hesitated to re-examine past decisions according the Fourteenth Amendment a less central role in the preservation of basic liberties than that which was contemplated by its Framers when they added the Amendment to our constitutional scheme.\" \n378 \nU.S., at 5\n. In the light of Gideon, Malloy, and other cases cited in those opinions holding various provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, the statements made in West and similar cases generally declaring that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the States can no longer be regarded as the law. We hold that petitioner was entitled to be tried in accordance with the protection of the confrontation guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, and that that guarantee, like the right against compelled self-incrimination, is \"to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\" Malloy v. Hogan, supra, \n378 \nU.S., at 10\n.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nUnder this Court's prior decisions, the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of confrontation and cross-examination was unquestionably denied petitioner in this case. As has been pointed out, a major reason underlying the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 407]\n\u00a0\n constitutional confrontation rule is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him. See, e. g., Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 330\n; Motes v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 458, 474\n; Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47, 55\n-56; Mattox v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 237, 242\n-243. Cf. Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 574, 581\n; Queen v. Hepburn, 7 Cranch 290, 295. This Court has recognized the admissibility against an accused of dying declarations, Mattox v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 140, 151\n, and of testimony of a deceased witness who has testified at a former trial, Mattox v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 237, 240\n-244. See also Dowdell v. United States, supra, \n221 \nU.S., at 330\n; Kirby v. United States, supra, \n174 \nU.S., at 61\n. Nothing we hold here is to the contrary. The case before us would be quite a different one had Phillips' statement been taken at a full-fledged hearing at which petitioner had been represented by counsel who had been given a complete and adequate opportunity to cross-examine. Compare Motes v. United States, supra, \n178 \nU.S., at 474\n. There are other analogous situations which might not fall within the scope of the constitutional rule requiring confrontation of witnesses. The case before us, however, does not present any situation like those mentioned above or others analogous to them. Because the transcript of Phillips' statement offered against petitioner at his trial had not been taken at a time and under circumstances affording petitioner through counsel an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Phillips, its introduction in a federal court in a criminal case against Pointer would have amounted to denial of the privilege of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Since we hold that the right of an accused to be confronted with the witnesses against him must be determined by the same standards whether the right is denied in a federal or state proceeding, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 408]\n\u00a0\n it follows that use of the transcript to convict petitioner denied him a constitutional right, and that his conviction must be reversed.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See state and English cases collected in 5 Wigmore, Evidence 1367, 1395 (3d ed. 1940). State constitutional and statutory provisions similar to the Sixth Amendment are collected in 5 Wigmore, supra, 1397, n. 1.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the result.\n\nI agree that in the circumstances the admission of the statement in question deprived the petitioner of a right of \"confrontation\" assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. I cannot subscribe, however, to the constitutional reasoning of the Court.\n\nThe Court holds that the right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment in federal criminal trials is carried into state criminal cases by the Fourteenth Amendment. This is another step in the onward march of the long-since discredited \"incorporation\" doctrine (see, e. g., Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Frankfurter, Memorandum on \"Incorporation\" of the Bill of Rights Into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 746 (1965)), which for some reason that I have not yet been able to fathom has come into the sunlight in recent years. See, e. g., Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n; Ker v. California, \n374 \nU.S. 23\n; Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nFor me this state judgment must be reversed because a right of confrontation is \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, reflected in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment independently of the Sixth.\n\nWhile either of these constitutional approaches brings one to the same end result in this particular case, there is a basic difference between the two in the kind of future constitutional development they portend. The concept of Fourteenth Amendment due process embodied in Palko \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 409]\n\u00a0\n and a host of other thoughtful past decisions now rapidly falling into discard, recognizes that our Constitution tolerates, indeed encourages, differences between the methods used to effectuate legitimate federal and state concerns, subject to the requirements of fundamental fairness \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" The philosophy of \"incorporation,\" on the other hand, subordinates all such state differences to the particular requirements of the Federal Bill of Rights (but see Ker v. California, supra, at 34) and increasingly subjects state legal processes to enveloping federal judicial authority. \"Selective\" incorporation or \"absorption\" amounts to little more than a diluted form of the full incorporation theory. Whereas it rejects full incorporation because of recognition that not all of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights should be deemed \"fundamental,\" it at the same time ignores the possibility that not all phases of any given guaranty described in the Bill of Rights are necessarily fundamental.\n\nIt is too often forgotten in these times that the American federal system is itself constitutionally ordained, that it embodies values profoundly making for lasting liberties in this country, and that its legitimate requirements demand continuing solid recognition in all phases of the work of this Court. The \"incorporation\" doctrines, whether full blown or selective, are both historically and constitutionally unsound and incompatible with the maintenance of our federal system on even course.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the result.\n\nI join in the judgment reversing this conviction, for the reason that the petitioner was denied the opportunity to cross-examine, through counsel, the chief witness for the prosecution. But I do not join in the Court's pronouncement which makes \"the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him . . . obligatory \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 410]\n\u00a0\n on the States.\" That questionable tour de force seems to me entirely unnecessary to the decision of this case, which I think is directly controlled by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"\n\nThe right of defense counsel in a criminal case to cross-examine the prosecutor's living witnesses is \"[o]ne of the fundamental guarantees of life and liberty,\"\n1\n and \"one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\"\n2\n It is, I think, as indispensable an ingredient as the \"right to be tried in a courtroom presided over by a judge.\"\n3\n Indeed, this Court has said so this very Term. Turner v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 466, 472\n-473.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nHere that right was completely denied. Therefore, as the Court correctly points out, we need not consider the case which could be presented if Phillips' statement had been taken at a hearing at which the petitioner's counsel was given a full opportunity to cross-examine. See West v. Louisiana, \n194 \nU.S. 258\n.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47, 55\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Alford v.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG, concurring.\n\nI agree with the holding of the Court that \"the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is . . . a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Ante, at 403. I therefore join in the opinion and judgment of the Court. My Brother HARLAN, while agreeing with the result reached by the Court, deplores the Court's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 411]\n\u00a0\n reasoning as \"another step in the onward march of the long-since discredited `incorporation' doctrine,\" ante, at 408. Since I was not on the Court when the incorporation issue was joined, see Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n, I deem it appropriate to set forth briefly my view on this subject.\n\nI need not recapitulate the arguments for or against incorporation whether \"total\" or \"selective.\" They have been set forth adequately elsewhere.\n1\n My Brother BLACK'S view of incorporation has never commanded a majority of the Court, though in Adamson it was assented to by four Justices. The Court in its decisions has followed a course whereby certain guarantees \"have been taken over from the earlier articles of the federal bill of rights and brought within the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, by a process which might aptly be described as \"a process of absorption.\" Ibid. See Cohen v. Hurley, \n366 \nU.S. 117, 154\n (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN); Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States, 36 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 761 (1961). Thus the Court has held that the Fourteenth \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 412]\n\u00a0\n Amendment guarantees against infringement by the States the liberties of the First Amendment,\n2\n the Fourth Amendment,\n3\n the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\n4\n the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination,\n5\n the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments,\n6\n and the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of the assistance of counsel for an accused in a criminal prosecution.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWith all deference to my Brother HARLAN, I cannot agree that this process has \"come into the sunlight in recent years.\" Ante, at 408. Rather, I believe that it has its origins at least as far back as Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 99\n, where the Court stated that \"it is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226\n.\" This passage and the authority cited make clear that what is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are \"rights,\" which apply in every case, not solely in those cases where it seems \"fair\" to a majority of the Court to afford the protection. Later cases reaffirm that the process of \"absorption\" is one of extending \"rights.\" See Ker v. California, \n374 \nU.S. 23\n; Malloy v. Hogan, \n378 \nU.S. 1\n, and cases cited by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in his dissenting opinion in Cohen v. Hurley, supra, at 156. I agree with these decisions, as is apparent from my votes in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 413]\n\u00a0\n Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n; Malloy v. Hogan, supra, and Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, \n378 \nU.S. 52\n, and my concurring opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, \n376 \nU.S. 254, 297\n, and I subscribe to the process by which fundamental guarantees of the Bill of Rights are absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment and thereby applied to the States.\n\nFurthermore, I do not agree with my Brother HARLAN that once a provision of the Bill of Rights has been held applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, it does not apply to the States in full strength. Such a view would have the Fourteenth Amendment apply to the States \"only a `watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.'\" Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 10-11. It would allow the States greater latitude than the Federal Government to abridge concededly fundamental liberties protected by the Constitution. While I quite agree with Mr. Justice Brandeis that \"[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a . . . State may . . . serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments,\" New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, \n285 \nU.S. 262, 280\n, 311 (dissenting opinion), I do not believe that this includes the power to experiment with the fundamental liberties of citizens safeguarded by the Bill of Rights. My Brother HARLAN'S view would also require this Court to make the extremely subjective and excessively discretionary determination as to whether a practice, forbidden the Federal Government by a fundamental constitutional guarantee, is, as viewed in the factual circumstances surrounding each individual case, sufficiently repugnant to the notion of due process as to be forbidden the States.\n\nFinally, I do not see that my Brother HARLAN'S view would further any legitimate interests of federalism. It would require this Court to intervene in the state judicial process with considerable lack of predictability and with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 400, 414]\n\u00a0\n a consequent likelihood of considerable friction. This is well illustrated by the difficulties which were faced and were articulated by the state courts attempting to apply this Court's now discarded rule of Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n. See Green, The Bill of Rights, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court, 46 Mich. L. Rev. 869, 897-898. These difficulties led the Attorneys General of 22 States to urge that this Court overrule Betts v. Brady and apply fully the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of right to counsel to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, at 336. And, to deny to the States the power to impair a fundamental constitutional right is not to increase federal power, but, rather, to limit the power of both federal and state governments in favor of safeguarding the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual. In my view this promotes rather than undermines the basic policy of avoiding excess concentration of power in government, federal or state, which underlines our concepts of federalism.\n\nI adhere to and support the process of absorption by means of which the Court holds that certain fundamental guarantees of the Bill of Rights are made obligatory on the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Although, as this case illustrates, there are differences among members of the Court as to the theory by which the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental liberties of individual citizens, it is noteworthy that there is a large area of agreement, both here and in other cases, that certain basic rights are fundamental - not to be denied the individual by either the state or federal governments under the Constitution.

It contended that although the annual gross receipts of WSIM are below the National Labor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n Relations Board's jurisdictional minimum of $100,000 per year for radio stations, WSIM is an integral part of a group of radio stations owned and operated by Charles W. Holt and the Holt Broadcasting Service and that the annual receipts of the common enterprise are in excess of $100,000, which is determinative under the Board's standards. Stating that every court has judicial power to determine its jurisdiction and that the union failed to allege \"that the appellant's [WSIM's] gross business exceeded $100,000 per annum,\" the Alabama Supreme Court held that the state courts had jurisdiction over WSIM's complaint. We granted certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 812\n. The judgment below must be reversed.\n\nAlthough a state court may assume jurisdiction over labor disputes over which the National Labor Relations Board has, but declines to assert, jurisdiction, 29 U.S.C. 164 (c) (1) and (2) (1958 ed., Supp. V), there must be a proper determination of whether the case is actually one of those which the Board will decline to hear. Hattiesburg Building Trades Council v. Broome, \n377 \nU.S. 126\n. The Board will assert jurisdiction over an employer operating a radio station if his gross receipts equal or exceed $100,000 per year, Raritan Valley Broadcasting Co., 122 N. L. R. B. 90, and in determining the relevant employer, the Board considers several nominally separate business entities to be a single employer where they comprise an integrated enterprise, N. L. R. B.

Association for the Benefit of Non-Contract Employees, also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n The Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks (Brotherhood) filed with the National Mediation Board (Board) an application under 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act which as later amended requested investigation of a representation dispute among the \"clerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service\" employees of United Air Lines (United). The Board had determined that grouping to be appropriate for collective bargaining in a case (R-1706) decided in 1947 after an extensive hearing in which United and other airlines by invitation gave their views. The Board found that a representation dispute existed and scheduled a secret election, proposing to use its standard ballot providing for the printing of the names of the two labor organizations in the dispute, with a third space for a \"write in\" designation but no space for a specific \"no union\" vote. Seeking to enjoin the Board from conducting an election unless it held a hearing on the craft or class issue and unless the ballot allowed an employee to vote against representation, United, after extensive correspondence with the Board, filed suit. The District Court dismissed the case, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the case is here on certiorari as No. 139. The Association for the Benefit of Non-Contract Employees of United (the Association), which had been formed only to be heard by the Board in a craft or class proceeding and to have the ballot amended, brought a similar suit after United's case was dismissed, and the Brotherhood intervened. The District Court enjoined the Board from conducting an election which did not permit an employee to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 651]\n\u00a0\n vote against collective bargaining representation. The Board and the Brotherhood filed separate appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed both cases, which are here on certiorari as Nos. 138 and 369. The Board later amended the ballot form to state that no employee is required to vote and that if less than a majority of employees casts valid ballots no representative will be certified. Held:\n\n 1. The Railway Labor Act precludes judicial review of the Board's certification of a collective bargaining representative Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, followed. Pp. 658-660.\n\n\n 2. The Board's action here is reviewable only to the extent of the question of the Board's performance of its statutory duty to \"investigate\" the representation dispute. P. 661.\n\n\n 3. The Board performed its statutory duty to conduct an investigation and designate the craft or class in which the election should be held. P. 661.\n\n\n  (a) The Board's duty to investigate is to make such informal, non-adversary investigation as the nature of the case may require. P. 662.\n\n\n  (b) The Board has not failed to make sufficient investigation and has not blindly followed its R-1706 ruling. Pp. 662-665.\n\n\n  (c) The Board did not adhere solely to the craft or class chosen by the unions, having consistently held hearings (though not required to do so) to determine the propriety of units requested by unions which were untested by actual collective bargaining, but dispensing with such hearings where, as here, experience has shown the grouping to be satisfactory. P. 665.\n\n\n  (d) The Act does not require that a carrier be made a party to whatever procedure the Board uses to determine the propriety of a craft or class, that status being given only to those who seek to represent employees; and whether and to what extent the carrier's views may be presented is solely within the Board's discretion. Pp. 666-667.\n\n\n  (e) The Board does not select the bargaining representative; it only investigates, defines the scope of the electorate, holds the election, and certifies the winner. P. 667.\n\n\n 4. The Board's decision as to the form of ballot or whether selection shall be by ballot is not subject to judicial review, and, in view of the Board's long-established election procedures, the District \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 652]\n\u00a0\n Court erred in enjoining the Board from holding an election with a ballot not providing opportunity on its face for an employee to vote against collective representation. Pp. 668-669.\n\n\n 5. The Board's rule of election procedure that \"no vote\" is a vote for no representation is within the Board's statutory authority under 2, Fourth and was favorable to the Association's employees. Pp. 670-671.\n\n\n 117 U.S. App. D.C. 387, 330 F.2d 853, judgments in Nos. 138 and 369 reversed, judgment in No. 139 affirmed.\n\nJames L. Highsaw, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner in No. 138. With him on the brief were Milton Kramer and William J. Donlon.\n\nStuart Bernstein argued the cause for petitioner in No. 139. With him on the brief were H. Templeton Brown and Robert L. Stern.\n\nSolicitor General Cox argued the cause for petitioners in No. 369 and respondents in No. 139. With him on the briefs were Assistant Attorney General Douglas, Daniel M. Friedman, Morton Hollander and John C. Eldridge.\n\nAlex L. Arguello argued the cause for respondent in Nos. 138 and 369. With him on the brief was Jerome C. Muys.\n\nClarence M. Mulholland and Edward J. Hickey, Jr., filed a brief for the Railway Labor Executives' Association, as amicus curiae, urging reversal in Nos. 138 and 369 and affirmance in No. 139.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese consolidated cases involve claims of United Air Lines (United) and the Association for the Benefit of Non-Contract Employees of United (the Association), attacking the form of ballot that the Board intends to use in a representation election among United's employees under 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 653]\n\u00a0\n as amended, 45 U.S.C. 152, Ninth (1958 ed.).\n1\n United also contends that the National Mediation Board (Board) should hold a hearing under the same section, with its participation, to determine the appropriate craft or class in which the election should be held. Before the Board the conflicting unions - Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks (Brotherhood) and International Association of Machinists (Machinists) - agreed that the appropriate craft or class in which the election should be held was \"clerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service employees\"; over the objection of United the Board ordered an election in this unit to determine which union, if either, would be its bargaining representative. United then filed suit against the Board raising the questions it presses here. This case was dismissed and is here, after affirmance by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 654]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals, as No. 139. After this dismissal the Association filed suit against the Board, the Brotherhood being permitted to intervene, and raised substantially the same claims. The District Court enjoined the Board from conducting an election with a ballot that did not permit an employee to cast a vote against collective bargaining representation; the other issues were remanded to the Board for further consideration. 218 F. Supp. 114. The Court of Appeals affirmed these cases by a divided court and they are here as Nos. 138 and 369. 117 U.S. App. D.C. 387, 330 F.2d 853. Judge Wright, dissenting, thought the District Court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the Board from conducting a representation election, citing Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n (1943). We granted certiorari in all three of the cases. \n379 \nU.S. 814\n.\n\nWe hold that the Board satisfied its statutory duty to investigate the dispute; that United is not entitled to be a party to proceedings by which the Board determines the scope of the appropriate craft or class; and that the Board's choice of ballot for its future elections does not exceed its statutory authority and is therefore not open to judicial review.\n\n   1. THE FACTS.\n\n\n In January 1947, after lengthy hearings in which United and other airlines participated at the request of the Board, it was determined that the \"clerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service\" grouping of employees constituted an appropriate craft or class, within the meaning of the Act, for collective bargaining purposes. Case No. R-1706, N. M. B. Determinations of Craft or Class 423 (1948). All of the parties here, save the Association, participated in this public hearing. Since that time they have participated in other cases involving the same questions decided in R-1706, but, with some exceptions, the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 655]\n\u00a0\n Board has continued through the years to hold elections in that craft or class.\n\nIn August 1962 the Brotherhood filed with the Board an application under 2, Ninth to investigate a representation dispute among employees of United. In its original application the Brotherhood proposed to exclude those stores and fleet service personnel then represented by the Machinists. After the Board had advised United and the Machinists of the Brotherhood's application each informed the Board that in its opinion the application should be dismissed because it did not conform to what the Board had found to constitute a craft or class in Case No. R-1706, supra. Alternatively, United requested that if dismissal was not in order the Board should hold hearings to determine the proper craft or class in which the election should be held. Upon receiving notice of this opposition the Brotherhood amended its application to include the full craft or class approved in R-1706. The Machinists then agreed that this was the appropriate unit in which to conduct the election.\n\nThe Board concluded that a dispute existed requiring an election and scheduled one for January 1963. It proposed to use its standard form of ballot which provided for the printing of the names of the labor organizations - in this case, the Brotherhood and the Machinists - with a box below each name for the employee to check the representative preferred. A third space was provided in which the employee could write in the name of any other organization or individual he wished to represent him. There was not a place on the ballot in which the employee could vote specifically for \"no union.\"\n\nThe Board, on December 19, 1962, directed that a list of the employees involved be supplied by United not later than January 14, 1963. On January 11 United advised that the request was premature and requested a hearing as to the scope of the unit involved in the Brotherhood's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 656]\n\u00a0\n amended application. It outlined in some detail the past practices of the Board in dealing with such requests and attacked the continued suitability of the R-1706 determination, asking that the case be re-opened and that the group be divided into three separate crafts or classes. On January 17 the Board denied this request. It pointed out that United on September 7, 1962, had objected to the craft proposed in the Brotherhood's original application on the sole ground that it did not conform to R-1706; that the Brotherhood had then amended its request to conform with R-1706; that United had been notified of this change on October 8, 1962; that on October 24 the Board had requested United to furnish the number of employees in the craft or class as amended and that it had furnished this information on November 2, stating that there were 12,451 as of a given date; and that it had failed to furnish the names of the employees. The Board then commented that \"the carrier is not a party to this representation dispute\"; that \"no request for a review of . . . Case No. R-1706, et al. has been received from either organization party to NMB Case No. 3590\" (the pending application of the Brotherhood); and that United's request was \"not timely made, since the Board, on December 19, 1962, found that a representation dispute existed among the employees in this craft or class, and has authorized an election.\" United requested reconsideration of this decision, but without success.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 18, 1963, when United advised the Board that it was \"willing to allow a ballot box election on Company property provided the ballot follows the form used by the National Labor Relations Board,\" i. e., the ballot \"would have a space for the employee to vote against representation as well as space for the employee to vote for representation\" by the Brotherhood or the Machinists. (Emphasis in the original.) The Board replied that its form of ballot had been used since 1934 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 657]\n\u00a0\n and that it saw no reason to depart from it. Thereafter United advised that it would furnish the list of employees by February 11, but on that date the list was refused and action was begun the next day against the Board in the District Court for the District of Columbia. This case was later dismissed, as we have noted.\n\nIt appears that while the election was being delayed the Association was being organized among United's employees. By March 1963 it claimed 6,400 members, about 50% of the total number of United's employees. It sought, like United, to be heard in a craft or class proceeding and to have the ballot amended. It stated, however, that it did not seek recognition as a bargaining representative, and it did not want its name on the ballot. It intended to dissolve after the election. The Board denied the applications.\n\nAfter United's case was dismissed, the Association filed a similar suit in the same court, seeking substantially the same relief. The Brotherhood was permitted to intervene, and it filed a separate appeal from that of the Board after the court had disposed of the case as we have already stated.\n\nAfter we granted certiorari, the Board adopted an amended form of ballot on which there appears the following directly above the names of the unions seeking election as representative:\n\n   \"INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOTING\n\n\n  \"No employee is required to vote. If less than a  majority of the employees cast valid ballots, no representative  will be certified.\"\n\n\n In effect, this amended ballot stated on its face what has been the practice of the Board in these elections since its inception. The Board has announced its intention to use this form of ballot in future representation elections, including any that may be held in this particular matter. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 658]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  2. THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT AND THE BOARD'S\n\nFUNCTION.\n\n\n\n\n The major objective of the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (1958 ed.), was \"the avoidance of industrial strife, by conference between the authorized representatives of employer and employee.\" Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 547\n (1937). Section 2 Ninth set up the machinery for the selection of the representatives of employees. It authorized the National Mediation Board, upon request, to investigate disputes over representation; to \"designate\" those who were affected; to use a secret ballot or any other appropriate means of ascertaining the choice of employees; to establish rules governing elections and to certify the representatives so chosen to represent the employees in negotiations. Upon the issuance of this certificate the employer, under the Act, is required to \"treat\" with the representative certified to it by the Board. As we said in Virginian R. Co.: \"The statute does not undertake to compel agreement between the employer and employees, but it does command those preliminary steps without which no agreement can be reached. It at least requires the employer to meet and confer with the authorized representative of its employees, to listen to their complaints, to make reasonable effort to compose differences - in short, to enter into a negotiation for the settlement of labor disputes such as is contemplated by 2, First.\" Id., at 548.\n\nIn Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n (1943), the petitioner sued for the cancellation of a Board representation certificate. The Court held that the Act precluded review of the Board's certification of a collective bargaining representative under 2, Ninth. The case involved a question of statutory construction, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 659]\n\u00a0\n i. e., whether the Act permitted the division of crafts or classes of a single carrier into smaller units for collective bargaining purposes. The Court refused to consider the merits of the claim, holding that it was for the Board, not the courts, finally to resolve such questions. \"The Act in 2, Fourth,\" the Court said, \"writes into law the `right' of the `majority of any craft or class of employees to `determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act.' That `right' is protected by 2, Ninth which gives the Mediation Board the power to resolve controversies concerning it and as an incident thereto to determine what is the appropriate craft or class in which the election should be held.\" Id., at 300-301. The Court goes on to note that Congress decided on the method which might be employed to protect this \"right\"; and that where Congress \"has not expressly authorized judicial review,\" id., at 301, \"this Court has often refused to furnish one even where questions of law might be involved,\" id., at 303. The Court's conclusion was that \"the intent seems plain - the dispute was to reach its last terminal point when the administrative finding was made. There was to be no dragging out of the controversy into other tribunals of law.\" Id., at 305. Thus, the Court held there could be no judicial review.\n\nIt is sometimes said that in Leedom v. Kyne, \n358 \nU.S. 184\n (1958), the Court created an \"exception\" to the doctrine of Switchmen's Union. In Kyne, it was held that the law afforded a remedy in the courts when unlawful action by the National Labor Relations Board inflicted injury on one of the parties to a bargaining dispute. But this was no exception to Switchmen's Union. Rather the Court was careful to note that \"[t]his suit is not one to `review.' in the sense of that term as used in the Act, a decision of the Board made within its jurisdiction. Rather it is one to strike down an order of the Board \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 660]\n\u00a0\n made in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the Act.\" Leedom v. Kyne, \n358 \nU.S. 184, 188\n. (Emphasis supplied.) The limited nature of this holding was re-emphasized only last Term where we referred to the \"narrow limits\" and \"painstakingly delineated procedural boundaries of Kyne.\" Boire v. Greyhound Corp., \n376 \nU.S. 473, 481\n (1964). It is with these principles in mind that we turn to the questions in the instant cases.\n\n  3. THE CRAFT OR CLASS DETERMINATION.\n\n\n The order of the District Court in Nos. 138 and 369 enjoins the Board from conducting an election \"in which the form of the ballot does not permit a voting employee to cast a vote against collective bargaining representation . . . .\" The Association concedes that the order does not enjoin the holding of the election until the Board reconsiders its craft or class determination; nor has it petitioned here for a review of that portion of the decision. Thus, we need not reach the question of the Association's right to demand or participate in proceedings leading to such a determination.\n\nThe same is not true of United, however, for it specifically sought and was denied such relief, and it comes here contending that this denial constituted error. United argues that since the Act compels it to treat with the representative chosen by the majority of its employees in the craft or class in which the election is held, it has a direct and substantial interest in the scope of that unit: and that since the Act provides for no administrative or judicial review, due process requires that it be accorded an opportunity to participate in the proceedings by which the Board determines which employees may participate.\n\nIt also contends that the Board, in designating the employees who could participate in the election, did not do so as a result of the statutorily required investigation - \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 661]\n\u00a0\n which, United contends, requires that the Board take evidence and make findings - but made an arbitrary determination, relying solely on the agreement of the unions.\n\nUnited's position is that Switchmen's Union does not control a claim that the Board has ignored an express command of the Act. This particular question was reserved in the 1943 cases. In General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n (1943), a companion case to Switchmen's Union, the Court stated: \"Whether judicial power may ever be exerted to require the Mediation Board to exercise the `duty' imposed upon it under 2, Ninth and, if so, the type or types of situations in which it may be invoked present questions not involved here.\" Id., at 336, n. 12. We think that the Board's action here is reviewable only to the extent that it bears on the question of whether it performed its statutory duty to \"investigate\" the dispute.\n2\n Reviewing that action, however, we conclude that the contention is completely devoid of merit.\n\nSection 2, Ninth makes it the duty of the Board to \"investigate\" a representation dispute and \"to certify to both parties, in writing, within thirty days after the receipt of the invocation of its services, the name or names \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 662]\n\u00a0\n of the individuals or organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent the employees involved in the dispute, and certify the same to the carrier.\" This command is broad and sweeping. We should note at the outset that the Board's duty to investigate is a duty to make such investigation as the nature of the case requires.\n3\n An investigation is \"essentially informal, not adversary\"; it is \"not required to take any particular form.\" Inland Empire District Council v. Millis, \n325 \nU.S. 697, 706\n (1945). These principles are particularly apt here where Congress has simply told the Board to investigate and has left to it the task of selecting the methods and procedures which it should employ in each case.\n\nIn dealing with the sufficiency of the investigation it is necessary to examine the experience of the Board through the years in resolving questions of craft or class appropriateness. That experience, insofar as it concerns the unit involved here, dates back to 1946 in Case No. R-1706, supra, when it was called upon for the first time to apply the craft or class principle of representation to the airline industry. At that time it had before it a fledgling industry, a relatively new statutory command and a huge group of employees for whom there were no recognized crafts or classes within the meaning of the Act. At least five unions were involved, all urging different employee groupings, and all of the major airlines were invited to participate in an extended public hearing. United was among those participating and in fact supported the very craft or class unit which the Board eventually decided upon and to which it has adhered here. Because it was the first time the Board had recognized such a craft or class, it cautiously provided in denying reconsideration of its determination that it was subject \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 663]\n\u00a0\n to future re-examination where to do so would further the purposes of the Act.\n\nThereafter began a period in which the workability of the R-1706 determination was tested in practice, and it did not go completely unchallenged. In 1948 United voluntarily recognized the Machinists as the collective bargaining representative for its ramp and stores employees. It supplied the Board with evidence upon which this recognition was based and its reasons for departing from its usual policy. It is noteworthy that the Board replied that voluntary recognition would not preclude future determination by the Board of the proper craft or class to which those employees would belong. In 1951 the determination of R-1706 withstood challenge in Matter of Representation of Employees of Northwest Airlines, Inc., Case No. R-2357, 2 N. M. B. Determinations of Craft or Class 60 (1955). United submitted a statement in this proceeding, emphasizing its disagreement with the R-1706 decision and requesting that it be disregarded. The Board refused to do so, but it did reiterate what it had implied in 1947 - that it was \"of the opinion that upon proper application . . . it will be advisable to reexamine the determination in case R-1706 et al., with the view of making such modifications as may be found to be justified at that time.\" Id., at 67. We note that in both cases - R-1706 and R-2357 - the unions competing for representative status were in disagreement as to the appropriate unit in which elections should be held. Again in 1952, in Case No. R-2482, 2 N. M. B. Determinations of Craft or Class 72 (1955), United participated when the Air Line Dispatch Clerks Association sought to represent its general dispatch clerks, dispatch clerks A, B, and C and crew schedulers; the Brotherhood there disputed the grouping, contending that R-1706 established the scope of the election. The Board sustained this position, which was also that of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 664]\n\u00a0\n United, and held that R-1706 should be adhered to. United had argued that the dispatch clerks and schedulers were not a separate craft or class but merely components of the R-1706 unit, and that representation could be had only through investigation and election in that group. The Board ultimately discussed the application in these terms:\n\n\"The precedents heretofore established by the Board, however, cannot be disregarded. Moreover, the record of stable industrial relations which has followed in the years since the Determination in R-1706 must be given due and careful consideration.\n\n\n \". . . In an industry which is still expanding, the agency charged with the duty of certifying designated representatives for collective bargaining must of necessity hesitate before acquiescing in the desires of certain employees to establish small segregated groups, because by that very course it may retard, or even destroy job opportunities. Flexibility in the use of employee talent carries just as many advantages for the employees as it does for the carrier. The Board is fully aware that the action taken herein will have, as an end result, the withholding of an immediate opportunity to select a collective-bargaining agent by this group of employees, but nevertheless, it is convinced that the basic purposes of the Railway Labor Act will be better served by adherence to the policy of preserving established crafts or classes.\" Id., at 76.\n\n\n Nor do the subsequent cases brought to our attention strip the R-1706 decision of its continuing validity. In both these matters - Cases No. C-2252 and C-2389, 3 N. M. B. Determinations of Craft or Class 16 (1961) - the Board determined that stock and storeroom employees were separate crafts or classes of employees at North Central and Trans-Texas Air Lines. Neither of these airlines \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 665]\n\u00a0\n had participated in the 1946 proceedings. Both were feeder lines, and in both cases the contending unions disagreed as to the appropriate unit in which the election should be held. In any event, the Board was simply pursuing the policy it had announced when it decided R-1706 - that it would re-examine craft or class determinations when it thought the purpose of the Act would be furthered thereby. This in itself belies the notion that the Board has blindly followed the R-1706 ruling.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIt is in light of this background that we must decide whether the Board's reaffirmation of the R-1706 determination in these cases was made after a sufficient investigation, within the meaning of the Act. We reject the contention that it adhered solely to the craft or class chosen by the unions. Time and again it has acknowledged that it has the task of determining the appropriateness of a craft or class, and nothing in this case suggests that it abdicated that responsibility here. Where units untested by actual collective bargaining have been proposed by the unions involved the Board has consistently held hearings to determine the propriety of holding elections in those crafts or classes. But where the unions have agreed and the unit they have agreed upon has been one well-established in industry bargaining circles, it has usually held elections without full-scale hearings, not simply because the unions agree but because the unit upon which they agree is one that is well-recognized under prior determinations of the Board and has proven satisfactory in actual experience. This is what it did here. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 666]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Board received the Brotherhood's application; it requested, received and considered statements from the carrier and the Machinists. On the basis of these preliminary actions, it scheduled an election. But it continued to correspond with United, accepting and studying its detailed application for reconsideration of the Board's decision to proceed to election in the R-1706 craft or class. Viewed alongside prior experience with the R-1706 grouping in the air transport industry this procedure clearly complied with the statutory command that the Board \"investigate\" the dispute. The only missing element of the required investigation is the election and that can now be held promptly.\n\nUnited sought to have the District Court require the Board to hold a hearing on the craft or class issue in which it would participate as a \"party in interest.\" But the Act does not require a hearing when the Board itself designates those who may participate in the election. It provides that \"the Board shall designate who may participate in the election . . ., or may appoint a committee of three neutral persons who after hearing shall within ten days designate the employees who may participate in the election.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Indeed, United seems aware of this, for it stated in its brief that if \"the Railway Labor Act does not specifically require a hearing, it does require an `investigation,'\" and that United must be heard in the course of that proceeding. Clearly, then, the Board cannot be required to hold a hearing.\n\nNor does the Act require that United be made a party to whatever procedure the Board uses to define the scope of the electorate. This status is accorded only to those organizations and individuals who seek to represent the employees, for it is the employees' representative that is to be chosen, not the carriers'. Whether and to what extent carriers will be permitted to present their views on \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 667]\n\u00a0\n craft or class questions is a matter that the Act leaves solely in the discretion of the Board.\n\nThe gist of United's claim, therefore, is that it should be accorded a greater role in the Board's investigation. This argument must be rejected. Here United participated in the proceeding establishing the craft or class in question as a cognizable grouping of employees, and it has had opportunities since that time to present further evidence. It must be remembered that United is under no compulsion to reach an agreement with the certified representative. As Chief Justice Stone said in Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, \"The quality of the action compelled, its reasonableness, and therefore the lawfulness of the compulsion, must be judged in the light of the conditions which have occasioned the exercise of governmental power.\" Id., at 558-559. Likewise, as the Court observed in Hannah v. Larche, \n363 \nU.S. 420, 442\n (1960), the procedural requirements in a particular proceeding depend on \"[t]he nature of the alleged right involved, the nature of the proceeding, and the possible burden on that proceeding . . . .\" The Board, as we noted in Switchmen's Union, performs the \"function of a referee.\" It does not select one organization or another; it simply investigates, defines the scope of the electorate, holds the election and certifies the winner. Thus, while the Board's investigation and resolution of a dispute in one craft or class rather than another might impose some additional burden upon the carrier, we cannot say that the latter's interest rises to a status which requires the full panoply of procedural protections. We find support for this conclusion when we consider the burden that acceptance of United's contentions would visit upon the administration of the Act. To require full-dress hearings on craft or class in each representation dispute would fly in the face of Congress' instruction that \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 668]\n\u00a0\n representatives should be certified within 30 days of invocation of the Board's services. It places beyond reach the speed which the Act's framers thought an objective of the first order.\n\nIn view of these considerations, we hold that the Board performed its statutory duty to conduct an investigation and designate the craft or class in which the election should be held and that it did so in a manner satisfying any possible constitutional requirements that might exist. Its determination, therefore, is not subject to judicial review. Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, supra. As was pointed out there, the \"highly selective manner in which Congress has provided for judicial review of administrative orders or determinations under the Act,\" id., at 305, indicates the confidence that it reposed in the Board. In turn the fair and equitable manner in which the Board has discharged its difficult function is attested by the admirable results it has attained.\n\n   4. THE FORM OF THE BALLOT.\n\n\n As we have noted the District Court enjoined the Board from conducting an election with a ballot that did not permit an employee to cast a vote against collective representation. We believe this was error. Section 2, Ninth empowers the Board to establish the rules governing elections. Moreover, it provides that in resolving representation disputes the Board is authorized \"to take a secret ballot of the employees involved, or to utilize any other appropriate method of ascertaining the names of their duly designated and authorized representatives in such manner as shall insure the choice of representatives by the employees without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by the carrier.\" Thus, not only does the statute fail to spell out the form of any ballot that might be used but it does not even require selection by ballot. It leaves the details to the broad discretion \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 669]\n\u00a0\n of the Board with only the caveat that it \"insure\" freedom from carrier interference. That the details of selecting representatives were to be left for the final determination of the Board is buttressed by legislative history clearly indicating as much.\n5\n See Hearings on H. R. 7650, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 34-35.\n\nIn summary, then, the selection of a ballot is a necessary incident of the Board's duty to resolve disputes. The Act expressly says as much, instructing the Board alone to establish the rules governing elections. Thus, it is clear that its decision on the matter is not subject to judicial review where there is no showing that it has acted in excess of its statutory authority.\n\nUnited and the Association, however, apparently relying on Leedom v. Kyne, supra, contend that the Board has exceeded its statutory authority in selecting the proposed ballot. The argument is that 2, Fourth, which provides that \"[t]he majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class\" requires a ballot with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 670]\n\u00a0\n a \"no union\" box. They urge that in Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, at 560, certification on the basis of a majority of the votes cast, rather than a majority of the eligible voters, was upheld on the ground that nonvoters \"are presumed to assent to the expressed will of the majority of those voting.\" And they say that the Board's ballot is inconsistent with this rationale. But the Board has not followed the presumption of Virginian R. Co. Indeed the caveat on the face of the proposed ballot expressly refutes such an assumption. The Board's rule of election procedure is that no vote is a vote for no representation, and this is now made plain to the voting employees. It is, as we have said, an assumption more favorable to the employees that the Association represents. Thus, under the Board's practice a majority of the craft or class, as required by 2, Fourth, does have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the group or, indeed, whether they shall have any representation at all.\n\nIt is also claimed that since 9 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 453, as amended, 61 Stat. 143, 29 U.S.C. 159 (a) (1958 ed.) and 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act are both designed to encourage collective bargaining and the National Labor Relations Board uses a ballot with a \"no union\" box, the Mediation Board must use one also. Even assuming that the \"no union\" ballot would implement the purpose of the Act. this is a far cry from saying that it is the only form of ballot that would do so. Given broad discretion as it is the Mediation Board has followed a presumption contrary to that adhered to by the Labor Relations Board. The latter has tailored its ballot to conform to the presumption of Virginian R. Co. If in a Labor Board election, an employee does not vote, he can safely be presumed to have acquiesced in the will of the majority of the voters. In a Mediation Board election, if the employee \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 671]\n\u00a0\n refuses to vote he is treated as having voted for no representation.\n\nWe venture no opinion as to whether the Board's proposed ballot will best effectuate the purposes of the Act. We do say that there is nothing to suggest that in framing it the Board has exceeded its statutory authority.\n\nUnable to point to any specific requirement of a \"no union\" ballot in the Act, United and the Association are left to arguing in terms of policy and broad generalities as to what the Railway Labor Act should provide. The very nature of the arguments indicates that the Board's choice of its proposed ballot is not subject to judicial review, for it was to avoid the haggling and delays of litigation that such questions were left to the Board. These are matters for Congress and the Board rather than the courts. Here the Board - a creature of Congress - has been, as we have said, careful to provide fair, yet effective procedures and we feel certain that it will continue to do so. If its decision on the ballot is not acceptable, the place to go is to Congress, not to us.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgments in Nos. 138 and 369 and affirm the judgment in No. 139.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2, Ninth provides: \"If any dispute shall arise among a carrier's employees as to who are the representatives of such employees designated and authorized in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the Mediation Board, upon request of either party to the dispute, to investigate such dispute and to certify to both parties, in writing, within thirty days after the receipt of the invocation of its services, the name or names of the individuals or organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent the employees involved in the dispute, and certify the same to the carrier. Upon receipt of such certification the carrier shall treat with the representative so certified as the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this chapter. In such an investigation, the Mediation Board shall be authorized to take a secret ballot of the employees involved, or to utilize any other appropriate method of ascertaining the names of their duly designated and authorized representatives in such manner as shall insure the choice of representatives by the employees without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by the carrier. In the conduct of any election for the purposes herein indicated the Board shall designate who may participate in the election and establish the rules to govern the election, or may appoint a committee of three neutral persons who after hearing shall within ten days designate the employees who may participate in the election. . . .\" 45 U.S.C. 152, Ninth.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Indeed in the keystone case dealing with the Railway Labor Act, Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, the validity of the Board's certificate was attacked because it failed to recite the number of eligible voters in the craft or class in which the election was held. The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether the certificate would be conclusive absent such a finding, but it commented: \"But we think it plain that if the Board omits to certify any of them [the facts concerning the number of eligible voters, the number participating and the choice of the majority], the omitted fact is open to inquiry by the court asked to enforce the command of the statute. . . . Such inquiry was made by the trial court, which found the number of eligible voters and thus established the correctness of the Board's ultimate conclusion.\" Id., at 562.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Ruby v. American Airlines, Inc., 323 F.2d 248, 255; WES Chapter, Flight Engineers' Int'l Assn. v. National Mediation Board, 114 U.S. App. D.C. 229, 232, 314 F.2d 234, 237.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It should be noted, however, that in nearly all cases subsequent to Nos. C-2252 and C-2389, the Board has held elections among clerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service employees without re-examining that grouping and without noticeable protest. Mr. Thompson, Executive Secretary of the Board, lists 19 such cases in his affidavit in the District Court supporting the Board's motion to dismiss. This hardly supports United's contention that the Board is clinging in this case to a determination it has found obsolete.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The legislative history supports the view that the employees are to have the option of rejecting collective representation. The ballot that the Board proposes to use in future elections fully comports with this conception of the Act. Using the Board's ballot an employee may refrain from joining a union and refuse to bargain collectively. All he need do is not vote and this is considered a vote against representation under the Board's practice of requiring that a majority of the eligible voters in a craft or class actually vote for some representative before the election is valid. The practicalities of voting - the fact that many who favor some representation will not vote - are in favor of the employee who wants \"no union.\" Indeed, the method proposed by the Board might well be more effective than providing a \"no union\" box, since, if one were added, a failure to vote would then be taken as a vote approving the choice of the majority of those voting. This is the practice of the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.\n\nMy dissent stems from the Court's approval of the form of ballot used by the National Mediation Board in representation elections. As I understand its opinion, the Court holds that the form of ballot devised by the Board is subject to judicial review, at least for the purpose of determining whether the Board \"acted in excess of its statutory authority.\" With that I agree. But the Court goes on to hold that the ballot devised by the Board does conform with the statute. With that I cannot agree. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nNothing decided in Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, forecloses a determination by this Court of the validity of the ballot form used by the Board. On the contrary, that case, which insulated from judicial review the Board's ultimate craft or class determinations, makes it all the more imperative that the Board be required to operate by fair and lawful procedures. Compare Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, \n373 \nU.S. 341, 361\n. To say that Switchmen's Union, by interpreting the Railway Labor Act (44 Stat. 577, as amended) to deprive courts of jurisdiction to review class or craft determinations, also deprived courts of jurisdiction to review the fundamental procedures used by the Board in arriving at those determinations \"would indeed be to `turn the blade inward.'\" Graham v. Brotherhood of Firemen, \n338 \nU.S. 232, 237\n.\n\nThe ballot lies at the heart of the Board's certification mechanism. It is used day in and day out and will be used on thousands of occasions in the future. What happened in this very case illustrates the vital and salutary effect of judicial scrutiny of the Board's procedures. The ballot form which the Court of Appeals held illegal in this litigation had been used by the Board for many years. Yet the Solicitor General, as a consequence of the grant of certiorari in this case, persuaded the Board to modify the ballot to reduce its ambiguities.\n1\n If the Court were understood as holding today that there can be no review \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 673]\n\u00a0\n of the ballot's structure, the Board would, of course, be free to return to the older historic form which the Solicitor General has virtually conceded is unfair and unlawful.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nEven as revised in response to our grant of certiorari in this case, however, the form of ballot to be used by the Board continues to list spaces only for the organizations actually competing for representation, with a blank space left for writing in an unlisted organization. No space is provided for voting for \"no union.\" Employees are still confronted with a ballot upon which they can mark a choice only among representatives, without an opportunity to mark a choice for no representative at all. This ballot form is directly attributable to the Board's view of what the bargaining pattern should be in the airline industry. The Board has stated that \"the act does not contemplate that its purposes shall be achieved, nor is it clear that they can be achieved, without employee representatives . . . .\"\n3\n As a result, the Board has designed its ballot to encourage employees to choose a labor organization to represent them collectively. I believe both the language of the Act and its legislative history belie this view and, for that reason, I would order the Board to reconsider the form of its ballot.\n\nSection 2, Fourth provides that \"Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 674]\n\u00a0\n representatives of their own choosing. The majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class . . . .\" The Act performs the function, familiar to the rest of our labor legislation, of furnishing the opportunity for majority determination within each employee group of what the nature of bargaining shall be. But the Act is not compulsory. Employees are not required to organize, nor are they required to select labor unions or anyone else as their representatives. It has always been recognized that under the law the employees have the option of rejecting collective representation.\n\nThe House Report on the bill, stated:\n\n \"2. It [H. R. 9861] provides that the employees shall be free to join any labor union of their choice and likewise be free to refrain from joining any union if that be their desire and forbids interference by the carriers' officers with the exercise of said rights.\" (Emphasis supplied.) (H. R. Rep. No. 1944 to accompany H. R. 9861, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1934, p. 2.)\n\n\n Much of the testimony on the bill was given by Commissioner Joseph B. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation and the principal draftsman of the legislation. His reply to a question by Congressman Huddleston reflects the contemporary understanding of the Act:\n\n \"Commissioner EASTMAN. No; it does not require collective bargaining on the part of the employees. If the employees do not wish to organize, prefer to deal individually with the management with regard to these matters, why, that course is left open to them, or it should be.\" (Hearings on H. R. 7650, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1934, p. 57.) \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 675]\n\u00a0\n And in the Senate, Senator Wagner insisted that this was the burden of the bill:\n\n\n \"Senator WAGNER. . . . I didn't understand these provisions compelled an employee to join any particular union. I thought the purpose of it was just the opposite, to see that the men have absolute liberty to join or not to join any union or to remain unorganized.\n\n\n \"Mr. CLEMENT. That is the way we hope they will read when they are finally amended.\" (Hearings on S. 3266, Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1934, p. 76.)\n\n\n See also Hearings, id., p. 12. That legislative history is directly counter to the conception of the Act reflected by the ballot form used by the Board, and spelled out in the particularized record of the present case.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe form of the ballot is markedly different from that evolved by the National Labor Relations Board under a statute which contained almost identical wording at the time the ballot was designed.\n5\n Originally the Labor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 676]\n\u00a0\n Board, like the Mediation Board, did not include a space for a \"no union\" vote. Since July 1937, however, it has consistently placed such a slot on the ballot to insure that an employee's vote for a particular representative does not spring from a feeling that the vying organizations present the only alternatives available. \"The policy adopted by the Board is designed merely to make sure that the votes recorded for a particular representative express a free choice rather than a choice in default of the possibility of expressing disapproval of both or all proposed representatives.\" In re Interlake Iron Corp., 4 N. L. R. B. 55, 61. \"The Act . . . does not require an unwilling majority of employees to bargain through representatives. It merely guarantees and protects that \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 677]\n\u00a0\n right of a majority if it chooses to exercise it.\" Ibid. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nCertainly the Board may use alternate devices for divining the desires of the employees. But each device must be tested within its own framework. Where the Board purports to gain its information through the traditional system of balloting the employees, all parties rely on that election to yield a meaningful result. Here the Board decided to employ the secret ballot and rely on its results exclusively. At the least then, the ballot must unambiguously convey to each employee the choices available to him under the law.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nBecause the National Mediation Board has hewn to the mistaken belief that its duty is to encourage collective representation in the airline industry, I would remand this case to the Board for further consideration in the light of the views here expressed. I would not attempt to dictate to the Board precisely what form the ballot should ultimately take. Within a broad range, that question surely lies within the Board's discretion. But it is a question the Board should confront with a correct understanding of the law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Solicitor General's changes would leave the slots on the ballot intact (not supplying a \"no union\" box) but would append the following caption:   \"INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOTING \"No employee is required to vote. If less than a majority of the employees cast valid ballots, no representative will be certified.\" It is this revised form of ballot which the Court today approves, rather than the old form which was before the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Before Switchmen's Union there were several decisions which furnished the National Mediation Board with clarifying interpretations of the Act. The Board found these \"decisions are very helpful . . . in that they serve to settle issues which, in the past, have frequently arisen to trouble the orderly and prompt adjustment of disputes over representation between different factions among employees.\" Annual Report of the National Mediation Board, 1938, pp. 5-6.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Administration of the Railway Labor Act by the National Mediation Board, 1934-1957, p. 15.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In a letter to United Air Lines, rejecting its objections to the form of the ballot, the Executive Secretary of the Board stated: \"Introduction of a `yes' or `no' ballot would contribute to, if it did not actually encourage, an attempt to circumvent the mandate of Congress that representatives be designated by carriers and their employees for the purposes described in Section 2, First and Second of the Railway Labor Act . . . .\" Letter to Charles Mason from Executive Secretary of the National Mediation Board, January 24, 1963.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The original 9 (c) of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 453, stated the Labor Board's powers in the following language: \"Whenever a question affecting commerce arises concerning the representation of employees, the Board may investigate such controversy and certify to the parties, in writing, the name or names of the representatives that have been designated or selected. In any such investigation, the Board shall provide for an appropriate hearing upon due notice, either in conjunction with a proceeding under \n\n[380 \nU.S. 650, 676]\n\u00a0\n section 10 or otherwise, and may take a secret ballot of employees, or utilize any other suitable method to ascertain such representatives.\" Compare 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act: \"If any dispute shall arise among a carrier's employees as to who are the representatives of such employees designated and authorized in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the Mediation Board, upon request of either party to the dispute, to investigate such dispute and to certify to both parties, in writing, within thirty days after the receipt of the invocation of its services, the name or names of the individuals or organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent the employees involved in the dispute, and certify the same to the carrier. . . . In such an investigation, the Mediation Board shall be authorized to take a secret ballot of the employees involved, or to utilize any other appropriate method of ascertaining the names of their duly designated and authorized representatives in such manner as shall insure the choice of representatives by the employees without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by the carrier. . . .\" 45 U.S.C. 152, Ninth (1958 ed.). The similarity in the purposes of the Wagner Act and the Railway Labor Act was pointed out in the report of the House Committee on Labor which stated that \"the bill is merely an amplification and further clarification of the principles enacted into law by the Railway Labor Act . . . .\" H.

Gen. 541 (Attorney General Clark).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Prior to this litigation, the only court to consider the ballot employed by the National Mediation Board found that failure to include a \"no union\" slot deprived the employees of a \"free choice.\" \"It is manifest that this ballot did not present the issue to the eligible voters.\" McNulty v.

Judgment for respondent was affirmed in the state courts on the ground that the state law did not require him to exhaust contract grievance procedures before suit, which he had not done. Held: Under federal policy reflected in the LMRA, contract grievance procedures, which apply to severance as well as other types of claims, must, unless specified as nonexclusive, be exhausted before direct legal redress is sought.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent Maddox brought suit in an Alabama state court against his employer, the Republic Steel Corporation, for severance pay amounting to $694.08, allegedly owed him under the terms of the collective bargaining \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 651]\n\u00a0\n agreement existing between Republic and Maddox' union. Maddox had been laid off in December 1953. The collective bargaining agreement called for severance pay if the layoff was the result of a decision to close the mine, at which Maddox worked, \"permanently.\"\n1\n The agreement also contained a three-step grievance procedure to be followed by binding arbitration,\n2\n but Maddox made no effort to utilize this mode of redress. Instead, in August 1956, he sued for breach of the contract. At all times material to his claim, Republic was engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n3\n and Republic's industrial relations with Maddox and his union were subject to the provisions of that Act.\n\nThe case was tried on stipulated facts without a jury. Judgment was awarded in favor of Maddox, and the appellate courts of Alabama affirmed on the theory that state law applies to suits for severance pay since, with the employment relationship necessarily ended, no further danger of industrial strife exists warranting the application of federal labor law.\n4\n Moore v. Illinois Central \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 652]\n\u00a0\n R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n (1941), and Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc. v. Koppal, \n345 \nU.S. 653\n (1953), cases decided under the Railway Labor Act,\n5\n were cited to support the proposition. Furthermore, it was held that under Alabama law Maddox was not required to exhaust the contract grievance procedures. We granted Republic's petition for certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 904\n, to determine whether the rationale of Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co. carries over to a suit for severance pay on a contract subject to 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.\n6\n We conclude that the state judgment must be reversed.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAs a general rule in cases to which federal law applies, federal labor policy requires that individual employees wishing to assert contract grievances must attempt use of the contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and union as the mode of redress.\n7\n If the union refuses to press or only perfunctorily presses the individual's claim, differences may arise as to the forms of redress then available. See Humphrey v. Moore, \n375 \nU.S. 335\n; Labor Board v. Miranda Fuel Co., 326 F.2d 172.\n8\n But \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 653]\n\u00a0\n unless the contract provides otherwise,\n9\n there can be no doubt that the employee must afford the union the opportunity to act on his behalf. Congress has expressly approved contract grievance procedures as a preferred method for settling disputes and stabilizing the \"common law\" of the plant. LMRA 203 (d), 29 U.S.C. 173 (d); 201 (c), 29 U.S.C. 171 (c) (1958 ed.). Union interest in prosecuting employee grievances is clear. Such activity complements the union's status as exclusive bargaining representative by permitting it to participate actively in the continuing administration of the contract. In addition, conscientious handling of grievance claims will enhance the union's prestige with employees. Employer interests, for their part, are served by limiting the choice of remedies available to aggrieved employees. And it cannot be said, in the normal situation, that contract grievance procedures are inadequate to protect the interests of an aggrieved employee until the employee has attempted to implement the procedures and found them so.\n\nA contrary rule which would permit an individual employee to completely sidestep available grievance procedures in favor of a lawsuit has little to commend it. In addition to cutting across the interests already mentioned, it would deprive employer and union of the ability to establish a uniform and exclusive method for orderly settlement of employee grievances. If a grievance procedure cannot be made exclusive, it loses much of its desirability as a method of settlement. A rule creating such a situation \"would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective agreements.\" Teamsters Local v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 103\n. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 654]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nOnce it is established that the federal rule discussed above applies to grievances in general, it should next be inquired whether the specific type of grievance here in question - one relating to severance pay - is so different in kind as to justify an exception. Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., and Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc. v. Koppal, supra, are put forward for the proposition that it is.\n\nIn Moore, the Court ruled that a trainman was not required by the Railway Labor Act to exhaust the administrative remedies granted him by the Act before bringing suit for wrongful discharge. MR. JUSTICE BLACK, for the Court, based the decision on the use of permissive language in the Act - disputes \"may be referred . . . to the . . . Adjustment Board . . . .\"\n10\n MR. JUSTICE BLACK wrote again in Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n (1950), a declaratory judgment suit brought in a state court by a railroad company against two unions to resolve a representation dispute. The Court held that jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board to resolve such disputes was exclusive. Moore was distinguished thus:\n\n \"Moore was discharged by the railroad. He could  have challenged the validity of his discharge before  the Board, seeking reinstatement and back pay. Instead  he chose to accept the railroad's action in discharging  him as final, thereby ceasing to be an  employee, and brought suit claiming damages for  breach of contract. As we there held, the Railway  Labor Act does not bar courts from adjudicating  such cases. A common-law or statutory action for  wrongful discharge differs from any remedy which \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 655]\n\u00a0\n  the Board has power to provide, and does not involve  questions of future relations between the railroad and  its other employees.\" \n339 \nU.S. 239\n, at 244.\n\n\n This distinction was confirmed in Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc. v. Koppal, supra:\n\n \"Such [a wrongfully discharged] employee may proceed  either in accordance with the administrative  procedures prescribed in his employment contract or  he may resort to his action at law for alleged unlawful  discharge if the state courts recognize such a  claim. Where the applicable law permits his recovery  of damages without showing his prior exhaustion  of his administrative remedies, he may so recover,  as he did in the Moore litigation, supra, under Mississippi  law.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n345 \nU.S. 653\n, at 661.\n\n\n Federal jurisdiction in both Moore and Koppal was based on diversity; federal law was not thought to apply merely by reason of the fact that the collective bargaining agreements were subject to the Railway Labor Act. Since that time the Court has made it clear that substantive federal law applies to suits on collective bargaining agreements covered by 204 of the Railway Labor Act, International Assn. of Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., \n372 \nU.S. 682\n, and by 301 (a) of the LMRA, Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n. Thus a major underpinning for the continued validity of the Moore case in the field of the Railway Labor Act, and more importantly in the present context, for the extension of its rationale to suits under 301 (a) of the LMRA, has been removed. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 656]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hold that any such extension is incompatible with the precepts of Lincoln Mills and cannot be accepted. Grievances depending on severance claims are not critically unlike other types of grievances. Although it is true that the employee asserting the claim will necessarily have accepted his discharge as final, it does not follow that the resolution of his claim can have no effect on future relations between the employer and other employees. Severance pay and other contract terms governing discharge are of obvious concern to all employees, and a potential cause of dispute so long as any employee maintains a continuing employment relationship. Only in the situation in which no employees represented by the union remain employed, as would be the case with a final and permanent plant shutdown, is there no possibility of a work stoppage resulting from a severance-pay claim. But even in that narrow situation, if applicable law did not require resort to contract procedures, the inability of the union and employer at the contract negotiation stage to agree upon arbitration as the exclusive method of handling permanent shutdown severance claims in all situations could have an inhibiting effect on reaching an agreement. If applicable law permitted a court suit for severance pay in any circumstances without prior recourse to available contract remedies, an employer seeking to limit the modes of redress that could be used against him could do so only by eliminating contract grievance procedures for severance-pay claims. The union would hardly favor the elimination, for it is in the union's interest to afford comprehensive protection to those it represents, to participate in interpretations of the contract, and to have an arbitrator rather than a court decide such questions as whether the company has determined to \"close permanently.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 657]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are, then, positive reasons why the general federal rule should govern grievances based on severance claims as it does others. Furthermore, no positive reasons appear why the general federal rule should not apply. \"Comprehensiveness is inherent in the process by which the law is to be formulated under the mandate of Lincoln Mills,\" and \"the subject matter of 301 (a) `is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law.'\" Teamsters Local v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S., at 103\n. Maddox' suit in the present case is simply on the contract, and the remedy sought, award of $694.08, did not differ from any that the grievance procedure had power to provide. Federal law governs \"Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter . . . .\"\n13\n Section 301 (a) of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. 185 (a) (1958 ed.), Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, supra. The suit by Maddox clearly falls within the terms of the statute and within the principles of Lincoln Mills, and because we see no reason for creating an exception, we conclude that the general federal rule applies.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe federal rule would not of course preclude Maddox' court suit if the parties to the collective bargaining agreement expressly agreed that arbitration was not the exclusive \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 658]\n\u00a0\n remedy.\n15\n The section of this contract governing grievances provides, inter alia:\n\n \"It is the purpose of this Section to provide procedure for prompt, equitable adjustment of claimed grievances. It is understood and agreed that unless otherwise specifically specified elsewhere in this Agreement grievances to be considered hereunder must be filed within thirty days after the date on which the fact or events upon which such alleged grievance is based shall have existed or occurred.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Any Employee who has a complaint may discuss the alleged complaint with his Foreman in an attempt to settle it. Any complaint not so settled shall constitute a grievance within the meaning of this Section, `Adjustment of Grievances'.\n\n\n \"Grievances shall be handled in the following manner:\n\n\n \"STEP 1. Between the aggrieved Employee, his Grievance Committeeman or Assistant Grievance Committeeman and the Foreman.\"\n\n\n The procedure calls for two more grievance-committee steps capped with binding arbitration of matters not satisfactorily settled by the initial steps.\n\nThe language stating that an employee \"may discuss\" a complaint with his foreman is susceptible to various interpretations; the most likely is that an employee may, if he chooses, speak to his foreman himself without bringing in his grievance committeeman and formally embarking on Step 1. Use of the permissive \"may\" does not of itself reveal a clear understanding between the contracting \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 659]\n\u00a0\n parties that individual employees, unlike either the union or the employer, are free to avoid the contract procedure and its time limitations in favor of a judicial suit. Any doubts must be resolved against such an interpretation. See United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574\n; Belk v. Allied Aviation Service Co., 315 F.2d 513, cert. denied, \n375 \nU.S. 847\n.\n\nFinally, Maddox suggests that it was not possible for him to make use of the grievance procedure, the first step of which called for a discussion within 30 days of his discharge with his foreman, because a mine that has permanently closed has no foreman - indeed, no employees of any kind. This casuistic reading of the contract cannot be accepted. The foreman did not vanish; and it is unlikely that the union grievance procedure broke down within 30 days of Maddox' discharge. In any event, the case is before us on stipulated facts; in neither the facts nor the pleadings is there any suggestion that Maddox could not have availed himself of the grievance procedure instead of waiting nearly three years and bringing a court suit.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The section of the contract dealing with severance allowance provided in relevant part:\n\n\"When, in the sole judgment of the Company, it decides to close permanently a plant or discontinue permanently a department of a mine or plant, or substantial portion thereof and terminate the employment of individuals, an Employee whose employment is terminated either directly as a result thereof because he was not entitled to other employment with the Company under the provisions of Section 9 of this Agreement - Seniority and Subsection C of this Section 14, shall be entitled to a severance allowance in accordance with and subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth in this Section 14.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See infra, p. 658.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 61 Stat. 136 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.

Consideration of such action should properly await a case presented under the Railway Labor Act in which the various distinctive features of the administrative remedies provided by that Act can be appraised in context, e. g., the make-up of the Adjustment Board, the scope of review from monetary awards, and the ability of the Board to give the same remedies as could be obtained by court suit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Of course a court suit on the collective bargaining agreement would still be governed by federal law. Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nThis is an ordinary, common, run-of-the-mill lawsuit for breach of contract brought by respondent Charlie Maddox, an iron miner employed by petitioner Republic Steel, to recover $694.08 of wages which he said the company owed him. This amount he said was due by the terms of a contract made between the company and the union representing workers at the mine at which Maddox worked, a contract which provided that if any employee should be discharged because the company \"permanently\" closed the mine, he should continue to be paid the amount of his regular wages for a number of weeks after the discharge. The mine closed down, Maddox lost his job, but \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 660]\n\u00a0\n the company nevertheless refused to continue to pay him the wages he said it had obligated itself to pay under the contract. To collect the money he hired a lawyer and went to court. The trial court in Alabama awarded him the $694.08 (the stipulated amount due, if any) and the Supreme Court of the State affirmed. This Court now reverses. It holds that because the contract, agreed to by the union, provided for binding arbitration of all \"grievances,\" federal law has deprived Maddox of his right to hire his own lawyer and to sue in a court of law for the balance of wages due,\n1\n and has instead left him with only the remedies set out in the contract: a long, involved grievance procedure, controlled by the company and the union, followed by compulsory arbitration, with his claim put in the hands of union officials and union lawyers whether he wants them to handle it or not.\n\nIn thus deciding on its own, or deciding that Congress somehow has decided, to expand apparently without limit the kinds of claims subject to compulsory arbitration, to include even wage claims, and in thus depriving individual laborers of the right to handle their wage claims for themselves, today's decision of the Court interprets federal law in a way that is revolutionary. Yet the Court disposes of this case as easily as it would reach the conclusion that 2 plus 2 equal 4. First the Court says that the contract between the union and the company provides that a laborer who wants to assert a \"contract grievance\" is bound to attempt to use the contract grievance procedure, which requires several stages of company-union meetings, negotiations, etc.,\n2\n to be followed \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 661]\n\u00a0\n by submitting the dispute for final decision to an arbitrator \"appointed by mutual agreement\" of the union and the company. Next the Court labels Maddox' claim \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 662]\n\u00a0\n for wages due him a \"grievance\" - and, indeed, no one would deny that Maddox was unhappy about the company's failure to pay him what it had promised. Finally the Court, citing as its authority 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n3\n lays down for this and future cases the flat rule that no matter what his contractual claim - or \"grievance,\" as the Court prefers to call it - an individual laborer, even though no longer an employee, has no choice but to follow the long, time-consuming, discouraging road to arbitration set out in the union-company contract, including having the union represent him whether he wants it to or not and whether or not he is still in its good graces. And of course the Court's logic leads irresistibly to the conclusion (although it has not yet had occasion to say so) that if instead of seeking wages due on discharge an employee wants to sue his employer for unpaid wages while he is still working, he cannot do that either, but must instead wait until the union processes his claim through the interminable stages of \"grievance procedure\" and then turns him over to the arbitrator, whom he does not want. Employees are thus denied a judicial hearing and state courts have their ancient power to try simple breach-of-contract cases taken away from them - taken away, not by Congress, I think, but by this Court. Today's holding is in my judgment completely unprecedented, and is the brainchild \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 663]\n\u00a0\n of this Court's recent consistently expressed preference for arbitration over litigation in all types of cases\n4\n and for accommodating the wishes of employers and unions in all things over the desires of individual workers. Since I do not believe that Congress has passed any law which justifies any inference at all that workers are barred from bringing and courts from deciding cases like this one, and since I am not sure that it constitutionally could, it is impossible for me to concur in this decision.\n\nI think one crucial flaw in the Court's logical presentation is that it treats things as the same which are in fact different. \"Grievance\" is a word of many meanings in many contexts, and yet the Court uses it without any discrimination among them. As used in the industrial field \"grievance\" generally signifies something that has happened that is unsatisfactory to employers or employees in connection with their work. Failure to settle serious and widespread grievances has sometimes brought about industrial tensions, strikes and violence, often disrupting the peace and doing irreparable harm to the economy of the Nation. In order to try to prevent such widespread disastrous results to the public, arbitration has come to be accepted as a good way to settle such semi-public controversies, which are more in the nature of power struggles between giants than ordinary justiciable controversies involving individual laborers.\n5\n When a contract provided for arbitration to settle disputes which affected many workers and which could lead to strikes, this Court \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 664]\n\u00a0\n approved it and held that since both sides - company and union - had agreed to this method of peaceful settlement, federal law would honor and enforce it. Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n. But to hold that the union and company can bind themselves to arbitrate a dispute of general importance affecting all or many of the union's members and vitally threatening the public welfare is a far cry from saying, as the Court does today, that an ordinary laborer whose employer discharges him and then fails to pay his past-due wages or wage substitutes must, if the union's contract with the employer provides for arbitration of grievances, have the doors of the courts of his country shut in his face to prevent his suing the employer to get his own wages for breach of contract. Lincoln Mills was a case involving a real and active collective bargaining dispute between union and employer over general working conditions; but the present case is a controversy not about general working conditions but about whether the company will pay one individual his wages.\n\nFor the individual, whether his case is settled by a professional arbitrator or tried by a jury can make a crucial difference. Arbitration differs from judicial proceedings in many ways: arbitration carries no right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment; arbitrators need not be instructed in the law; they are not bound by rules of evidence; they need not give reasons for their awards; witnesses need not be sworn; the record of proceedings need not be complete; and judicial review, it has been held, is extremely limited.\n6\n To say that because the union chose a contract providing for grievance arbitration an individual employee freely and willingly chose this \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 665]\n\u00a0\n method of settling any contractual claims of his own which might later arise is surely a transparent and cruel fiction. And even if the employee could with any truth be regarded as having himself agreed to such a thing, until recently this Court refused to recognize and enforce contracts under which individuals were to be denied access to courts and instead left to the comparatively standardless process of arbitration. An insurance company cannot enforce a contract made with its insured to arbitrate all disputes which might arise in the future, this Court said, since such an agreement would be \"an attempt to oust the courts of jurisdiction by excluding the assured from all resort to them for his remedy.\" Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Ins. Co., 7 Wall. 386, 391. Cf. Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445. The Court holds today, however, that a union representing a worker in a mine or factory can by the union's contract take away from that worker his right to sue, which he would not be able to contract away himself unless the Riddlesbarger case is to be overruled. Compare Moseley v. Electronic & Missile Facilities, Inc., \n374 \nU.S. 167, 172\n-173 (concurring opinion). And there is nothing in the legislative history of 301 which indicates any congressional purpose to overrule or avoid the Riddlesbarger rule. Moreover, there is not one word in 301 about agreements to arbitrate. It is true that this Court said in Lincoln Mills, \"Plainly the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to strike,\" and \"the entire tenor of the history indicates that the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes was considered as quid pro quo of a no-strike agreement.\"\n7\n In that case, however, the Court expressly recognized that its decision and reasoning did \"not reach\" the right of individual employees to bring suit in court on their individual claims.\n8\n Forcing Charlie \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 666]\n\u00a0\n Maddox, who is out of a job, to submit his claim to arbitration is not going to promote industrial peace. Charlie Maddox is not threatening to go out in the street by himself and stage a strike against the Republic Steel Corporation to get his unpaid wages. Merely because this Court in Lincoln Mills has expressed its preference for arbitration when used to avoid industrial warfare by heading off violent clashes between powerful employers and powerful unions,\n9\n it does not follow that 301 should be expanded to require a worker to arbitrate his wage claim or to surrender his right to bring his own suit to enforce that claim in court. Such an expansion would run counter to this Court's long-established policy of preserving the ancient, treasured right to judicial trials in independent courts according to due process of law.\n\nThe past decisions of this Court which are closest to the case before us are not Lincoln Mills and cases like it, which involved broad conflicts between unions and employers with reference to contractual terms vital to settlement of genuine employer-union disputes. The cases really in point are those which involved agreements governed by the Railway Labor Act\n10\n and which expressly refused to hold that a discharged worker must pursue collective bargaining grievance procedures before suing in a court for wrongful discharge. Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc. v. Koppal, \n345 \nU.S. 653\n; Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n. While those were wrongful-discharge cases and the suit here is for wages due on a contract after discharge, the principle of those cases is precisely applicable here, since as was pointed out \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 667]\n\u00a0\n in Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239, 244\n, the claim of a person no longer employed will almost never involve questions substantially affecting future relations between an employer and the remaining employees. The Court recognizes the relevance of Moore and Koppal and, while declining expressly to overrule them in this case, has raised the overruling axe so high that its falling is just about as certain as the changing of the seasons. Yet although members of Congress and alert counsel for the national unions and employers are bound to have been familiar with Moore at the time the comprehensive labor statute of which 301 is a part was enacted, Congress did not see fit to disown the Moore rule and did not express a preference for a different policy with reference to individual suits on collective bargaining agreements covered by the LMRA.\n\nThe Court's opinion manifests great concern for the interests of employers and unions, but not, I fear, enough understanding and appreciation for an individual worker caught in the plight Maddox is in. The Court refers with seeming approval to the \"`common law' of the plant,\" and directs attention to the clear interest that the union has in handling employees' grievances in order to \"enhance the union's prestige with employees.\" It also refers to the great interest that an employer has (and I agree) in having a complicated procedural system which dissatisfied employees are here compelled to follow, which ends up in binding arbitration and which relieves the employer of a lawsuit. The Court then expresses its view that allowing this former employee to sue without going through the grievance procedure and arbitration, as he would be permitted to do in this case by the law of his State,\n11\n has \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 668]\n\u00a0\n \"little to commend it\" and \"would deprive employer and union of the ability to establish a uniform and exclusive method for orderly settlement of employee grievances.\" I emphasize the words \"employer\" and \"union\" to point out that here, as elsewhere in the opinion, theirs seem to be the chief interests on which the Court's attention is focused. The procedure they (employer and union) want must be \"made exclusive,\" or else they might not like it.\n12\n Individual workers are to take some comfort, I suppose, in the Court's statement that \"it cannot be said, in the normal situation, that contract grievance procedures are inadequate to protect the interests of an aggrieved employee until the employee has attempted to implement the procedures and found them so.\" I think it can be said, however, and I say it. I think an employee is just as capable of trying to enforce payment of his wages or wage substitutes under a collective bargaining agreement as his union, and he certainly is more interested in this effort than any union would likely be. This is particularly true where the employee has lost his job and is most likely outside the union door looking in instead of on hand to push for his claim. Examples certainly have not been wanting from which the Court might learn that often employees for one reason or another have felt themselves compelled to sue the union as a prerequisite to obtaining any help from the union at all. See, e. g., Humphrey v. Moore, \n375 \nU.S. 335\n; Syres v. Oil Workers Int'l Union, \n350 \nU.S. 892\n; Brotherhood of R. Trainmen v. Howard, \n343 \nU.S. 768\n; Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, \n323 \nU.S. 210\n; Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192\n. But, says the Court, the employee attempting to recover wages owed him must, unless the collective bargaining \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 669]\n\u00a0\n contract of the company and the union provides otherwise, \"afford the union the opportunity to act on his behalf.\" The Court then implies that if the union \"refuses to press or only perfunctorily presses the individual's claim,\" there may be some form of redress available to the worker, but we are left in the dark as to what form that redress might take. It may be that the worker would be allowed to sue after he had presented his claim to the union and after he had suffered the inevitable discouragement and delay which necessarily accompanies the union's refusal to press his claim. But I cannot agree that this is the sort of remedy a worker should have to invoke to bring a simple lawsuit.\n\nI am wholly unable to read 301 as laying any such restrictive burdens on an employee. And I think the difference between my Brethren and me in this case is not simply one concerning this Court's function in interpreting or formulating laws. There is also apparently a vast difference between their philosophy and mine concerning litigation and the role of courts in our country. At least since Magna Carta people have desired to have a system of courts with set rules of procedure of their own and with certain institutional assurances of fair and unbiased resolution of controversies. It was in Magna Carta, the English Bill of Rights, and other such charters of liberty, that there originally was expressed in the English-speaking world a deep desire of people to be able to settle differences according to standard, well-known procedures in courts presided over by independent judges with jurors taken from the public. Because of these deep-seated desires, the right to sue and be sued in courts according to the \"law of the land,\" known later as \"due process of law,\" became recognized. That right was written into the Bill of Rights of our Constitution and in the constitutions of the States. See Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 235\n-238. Even if it be true, which I do not concede, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 650, 670]\n\u00a0\n that Congress could force a man in this country to have his ordinary lawsuit adjudicated not under due process of law, i. e., without the constitutional safeguards of a court trial, I do not think that this Court should ever feel free to infer or imply that Congress has taken such a step until the words of the statute are written so clearly that no one who reads them can doubt.

He has not agreed since the controversy arose, or even for that matter before it arose, to arbitrate it, and so he should not have the doors of the courts shut in his face. Nor do I believe that he or any other member of the union should be treated as an incompetent unable to pursue his own simple breach-of-contract losses. I cannot and do not believe any law Congress has passed provides that when a man becomes a member of a labor union in this country he thereby has somehow surrendered his own freedom and liberty to conduct his own lawsuit for wages. Of course this is not the worst kind of servitude to which a man could be subjected, but it is certainly contrary to the spirit of freedom in this country to infer from the blue that workers lose their rights to appeal to the courts for redress when they believe they are mistreated.

PAUL(1965)\nNo. 532\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1965\n\n\n\n\n This class action to effect pupil and faculty desegregation of the Fort Smith, Arkansas, high schools was brought several years ago by petitioners, two Negro students. The courts below refused to order respondents to transfer petitioners or to order immediate desegregation of the high schools and it was also held that petitioners had no standing to challenge racial faculty allocation. Since one of the students had graduated during the pendency of the suit, and the other had reached the 12th grade, two other Negro students, one in the 10th grade and the other in the 11th grade, moved in this Court to be added as party plaintiffs. Held:\n\n 1. The motion to add parties is granted.\n\n\n 2. The assignment of petitioners to a Negro high school on the basis of race is constitutionally prohibited, both for the reasons stated in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n, and because petitioners are prevented from taking courses offered only at another school limited to white students. Pending immediate desegregation of the high schools according to a general plan, petitioners and those similarly situated shall be allowed immediate transfer to the high school from which they were excluded because of race and which has the more extensive curriculum.\n\n\n 3. Under two theories, the first of which plainly applies, students not yet in desegregated grades would have standing to challenge racial faculty allocation: Such allocation (a) of itself denies them equality of educational opportunity, and (b) renders inadequate an otherwise constitutional pupil desegregation plan soon to be applied to their grades.\n\n\n Certiorari granted; 345 F.2d 117, vacated and remanded.\n\nJack Greenberg, James M.

The judgment of that court is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n1. This class action to desegregate the public high schools of Fort Smith, Arkansas, was commenced several years ago in the name of two Negro students. One of the students has since graduated and the other has entered the last high school grade. A motion to add parties is made on behalf of two additional Negro students. It is alleged therein, and not denied by respondents, that these students are in the 10th and 11th grades of high school and that they are members of the class represented, seeking the same relief for all the reasons offered by the original party plaintiffs. That motion is accordingly granted.\n\n2. The desegregation plan adopted in 1957 desegregates only one grade a year and the 10th, 11th and 12th high school grades are still segregated. The students who are petitioners here were assigned to a Negro high school on the basis of their race.\n*\n Those assignments are constitutionally forbidden not only for the reasons stated in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n, but also because petitioners are thereby prevented from taking certain courses offered only at another high school limited to white students, see Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, \n305 \nU.S. 337\n; Sipuel v. Board of Regents, \n332 \nU.S. 631\n; Sweatt v. Painter, \n339 \nU.S. 629\n. Petitioners are entitled to immediate relief; we have emphasized that \"[d]elays in desegregating school systems are no longer tolerable.\" Bradley v. School Board, ante, p. 103, at 105. Pending the desegregation of the public high \n\n[382 \nU.S. 198, 200]\n\u00a0\n schools of Fort Smith according to a general plan consistent with this principle, petitioners and those similarly situated shall be allowed immediate transfer to the high school that has the more extensive curriculum and from which they are excluded because of their race.\n\n3. From the outset of these proceedings petitioners have challenged an alleged policy of respondents of allocating faculty on a racial basis. The District Court took the view that petitioners were without standing to challenge the alleged policy, and accordingly refused to permit any inquiry into the matter. The Court of Appeals sustained this ruling, holding that only students presently in desegregated grades would have the standing to make that challenge. 345 F.2d 117, 125. We do not agree and remand for a prompt evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n\nEven the Court of Appeals' requirement for standing would be met on remand since petitioners' transfer to the white high school would desegregate their grades to that limited extent. Moreover, we reject the Court of Appeals' view of standing as being unduly restrictive. Two theories would give students not yet in desegregated grades sufficient interest to challenge racial allocation of faculty: (1) that racial allocation of faculty denies them equality of educational opportunity without regard to segregation of pupils; and (2) that it renders inadequate an otherwise constitutional pupil desegregation plan soon to be applied to their grades. See Bradley v. School Board, supra. Petitioners plainly had standing to challenge racial allocation of faculty under the first theory and thus they were improperly denied a hearing on this issue.\n\n    Vacated and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE FORTAS would set the case down for argument and plenary consideration.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The constitutional adequacy of the method chosen for assigning students to the schools for purpose of desegregating the lower grades is not before us, and the method contemplated for the high schools is not part of the record. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 198, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROSENBLATT v.

At the end of his trial he requested that the jury be instructed that it could acquit him of that offense, a felony, but could convict him of the lesser-included misdemeanors of willfully filing a fraudulent or false return in violation of 7207, or willfully failing to pay his taxes when due in violation of 7203. The request was denied and petitioner was found guilty. The Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. Held:\n\n 1.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner Sansone was indicted for willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes for the year 1957 in violation of 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Section 7201 provides:\n\n \"Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\"\n\n\n The following facts were established at trial. In March 1956 petitioner and his wife purchased a tract of land for $22,500 and simultaneously sold a portion of the tract for $20,000. In August 1957 petitioner sold another portion of the tract for $27,000. He did not report the gain on either the 1956 or 1957 sale in his income tax returns for those years.\n1\n Petitioner conceded that the 1957 transaction was reportable and that, in not reporting it, he understated his tax liability for that year by $2,456.48. He contended, however, that this understatement was not willful since he believed at the time that extensive repairs on a creek adjoining a portion of the tract he retained might be necessary and that the cost of these repairs might wipe out his profit on the 1957 sale.\n\nTo counter this defense, the Government introduced the following signed statement made by petitioner during the Treasury investigation of his tax return:\n\n \"I did not report the 1957 sale in our joint income tax return for 1957 because I was burdened with a \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n number of financial obligations and did not feel I could raise the money to pay any tax due. It was my intention to report all sales in a future year and pay the tax due. I knew that I should have reported the 1957 sale, but my wife did not know that it should have been reported. It was not my intention to evade the payment of our proper taxes and I intended to pay any additional taxes due when I was financially able to do so.\"\n\n\n At the conclusion of the trial, petitioner requested that the jury be instructed that it could acquit him of the charged offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat taxes in violation of 7201, but still convict him of either or both of the asserted lesser-included offenses of willfully filing a fraudulent or false return, in violation of 7207,\n2\n or willfully failing to pay his taxes at the time required by law, in violation of 7203.\n3\n Section 7201 is a felony providing for a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for five years. Both 7203 and 7207 are misdemeanors with maximum prison sentences of one year under each \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n section, and maximum fines of $10,000 under 7203 and $1,000 under 7207.\n\nThe requested instructions were denied.\n4\n Petitioner was found guilty by the jury of violating 7201, and was \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n sentenced by the court to pay a fine of $2,000 and to serve 15 months' imprisonment. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeals. 334 F.2d 287. We granted certiorari to consider the applicability of the lesser-included offense doctrine to these federal tax statutes. \n379 \nU.S. 886\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe are faced with the threshold question as to whether or not 7207, which proscribes the willful filing with a Treasury official of any known false or fraudulent \"return,\" applies to the filing of an income tax return.\n5\n If 7207 does not apply to income tax returns, it is obvious that the defendant was not here entitled to a lesser-included offense charge based on that section.\n\nThis Court held in Achilli v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 373\n. that 7207's statutory predecessor, 3616 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which made it a misdemeanor for any person to deliver to the Collector of Revenue \"any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made . . .\" (emphasis added), despite its broad language, was not intended by Congress to apply to income tax returns.\n\nThere were two major bases of this Court's conclusion in Achilli that 3616 (a) did not apply to such returns. First, unlike other criminal provisions clearly applicable to income taxes which appeared in the income tax chapter of the 1939 Code and were specifically designed to punish evasion of that tax, 3616 (a) was placed among the Code's \"General Administrative Provisions\" and did not specifically refer to income taxes. Second, 3616 (a) required that the false or fraudulent return be filed \"with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made.\" This provision, as the Court had already held in Berra v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 131\n, if applied to income tax returns would have made 3616 (a) completely co-extensive with the predecessor of 7201 where the attempt to evade income taxes was accomplished by filing a fraudulent income tax return. It was clear that the predecessor of 7201 applied to this method of attempting to evade income taxes and the Court was unwilling to presume that Congress intended to enact both felony and misdemeanor provisions which completely overlap in this important area.\n\nBoth of these bases of decision were removed by the 1954 Code. Unlike their predecessors in the 1939 Code, 7201, 7203, and 7207, together with other sections clearly applicable to income tax violations, were all placed in the same section (Part I of Chapter 75) of the 1954 Code. Congress specifically stated that it placed all these provisions in the same part of the Code because it wished them to apply to taxes generally, including income taxes. See S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 147; H. R. Rep. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 108. In contrast, Part II of Chapter 75 contains provisions applicable only to specified taxes, none of which include income taxes.\n\nFurther, Congress, in enacting 7207 did not re-enact 3616 (a)'s requirement that the false or fraudulent return be made with \"intent to defeat or evade\" the tax due. Thus the second basis for the Court's conclusion in Achilli that 3616 (a) did not apply to income taxes was removed. See Berra v. United States, supra, at 134, n. 5. Finally, in providing that the false or fraudulent return be made \"willfully,\" 7207 was conformed to the language contained in the other misdemeanor provisions clearly applicable to income taxes. See, e. g., 7203.\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that 7207 applies to income tax violations. Since there is no doubt that 7201 and 7203 also apply to income tax violations, with obvious overlapping among them, there can be no doubt that the lesser-included offense doctrine applies to these statutes in an appropriate case. See Spies v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 492, 495\n; Berra v. United States, supra.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe basic principles controlling whether or not a lesser-included offense charge should be given in a particular case have been settled by this Court. Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part, that the \"defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged.\" Thus, \"[i]n a case where some of the elements of the crime charged themselves constitute a lesser crime, the defendant, if the evidence justifie[s] it . . . [is] entitled to an instruction which would permit a finding of guilt of the lesser offense.\" Berra v. United States, supra, at 134. See Stevenson v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 313\n. But a lesser-offense charge is not proper where, on the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n evidence presented, the factual issues to be resolved by the jury are the same as to both the lesser and greater offenses. Berra v. United States, supra; Sparf v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 63\n-64. In other words, the lesser offense must be included within but not, on the facts of the case, be completely encompassed by the greater. A lesser-included offense instruction is only proper where the charged greater offense requires the jury to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the lesser-included offense. Berra v. United States, supra; Sparf v. United States, supra, at 63-64.\n6\n We now apply the principles declared in these cases to the instant case.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe offense here charged was a violation of 7201, which proscribes willfully attempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. As this Court has recognized, this felony provision is \"the capstone of a system of sanctions which singly or in combination were calculated to induce prompt and forthright fulfillment of every duty under the income tax law and to provide a penalty suitable to every degree of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n delinquency.\" Spies v. United States, supra,at 497. As such a capstone, 7201 necessarily includes among its elements actions which, if isolated from the others, constitute lesser offenses in this hierarchical system of sanctions. Therefore, if on the facts of a given case there are disputed issues of fact which would enable the jury rationally to find that, although all the elements of 7201 have not been proved, all the elements of one or more lesser offenses have been, it is clear that the defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense charge as to such lesser offenses.\n\nAs has been held by this Court, the elements of 7201 are willfulness; the existence of a tax deficiency, Lawn v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 339, 361\n; Spies v. United States, supra, at 496; and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax, Spies v. United States, supra. In comparison, 7203 makes it a misdemeanor willfully to fail to perform a number of specified acts at the time required by law - the one here relevant being the failure to pay a tax when due. This misdemeanor requires only willfulness and the omission of the required act - here the payment of the tax when due. As recognized by this Court in Spies v. United States, supra, at 499, the difference between a mere willful failure to pay a tax (or perform other enumerated actions) when due under 7203 and a willful attempt to evade or defeat taxes under 7201 is that the latter felony involves \"some willful commission in addition to the willful omissions that make up the list of misdemeanors.\" Where there is, in a 7201 prosecution, a disputed issue of fact as to the existence of the requisite affirmative commission in addition to the 7203 omission, a defendant would, of course, be entitled to a lesser-included offense charge based on 7203. Cf. Spies v. United States, supra. In this case, however, it is undisputed that petitioner filed \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 352]\n\u00a0\n a tax return and that the petitioner's filing of a false tax return constituted a sufficient affirmative commission to satisfy that requirement of 7201. The only issue at trial was whether petitioner's act was willful. Given this affirmative commission and the conceded tax deficiency, if petitioner's act was willful, that is, if the jury believed, as it obviously did, that he knew that the capital gain on the sale of the property was reportable in 1957, he was guilty of violating both 7201 and 7203. If his act was not willful he was not guilty of violating either 7201 or 7203. Thus on the facts of this case, 7201 and 7203 \"covered precisely the same ground.\" Berra v. United States, supra, at 134. This being so, on the authorities cited, it is clear that petitioner was not entitled to a lesser-included offense charge based on 7203.\n\nSection 7207 requires the willful filing of a document known to be false or fraudulent in any material manner. The elements here involved are willfulness and the commission of the prohibited act. Section 7207 does not, however, require that the act be done as an attempt to evade or defeat taxes. Conduct could therefore violate 7207 without violating 7201 where the false statement, though material, does not constitute an attempt to evade or defeat taxation because it does not have the requisite effect of reducing the stated tax liability. This may be the case, for example, where a taxpayer understates his gross receipts and he offsets this by also understating his deductible expenses. In this example, if the Government in a 7201 case charged tax evasion on the grounds that the defendant had understated his tax by understating his gross receipts, and the defendant contended that this was not so, as the misstatement of gross receipts had been offset by an understatement of deductible expenses, the defendant would be entitled to a lesser-included \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 353]\n\u00a0\n offense charge based on 7207, there being this relevant disputed issue of fact. This would be so, for in such a case, if the jury believed that an understatement of deductible expenses had offset the understatement of gross receipts, while the defendant would have violated 7207 by willfully making a material false and fraudulent statement on his return, he would not have violated 7201 as there would not have been the requisite 7201 element of a tax deficiency. Here, however, there is no dispute that petitioner's material misstatement resulted in a tax deficiency. Thus there is no disputed issue of fact concerning the existence of an element required for conviction of 7201 but not required for conviction of 7207. Given petitioner's material misstatement which resulted in a tax deficiency, if, as the jury obviously found, petitioner's act was willful in the sense that he knew that he should have reported more income than he did for the year 1957, he was guilty of violating both 7201 and 7207. If his action was not willful, he was guilty of violating neither. As was true with 7203, on the facts of this case 7201 and 7207 \"covered precisely the same ground,\" Berra v. United States, supra, at 134, and thus petitioner was not entitled to a lesser-included offense charge based on 7207.\n\nPetitioner makes one final contention. He argues that he could have been acquitted of attempting to evade or defeat his 1957 taxes, in violation of 7201, but still have been convicted for willfully failing to pay his tax when due in violation of 7203 or willfully filing a fraudulent return in violation of 7207, if the jury believed his statement contained in the government-introduced affidavit, that, although he knew that profit on the sale in question was reportable for 1957 and that tax was due thereon, he intended to report the sale and pay the 1957 tax at some unspecified future date. The basic premise of this argument \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 354]\n\u00a0\n is that, although all three sections require willfulness, on the facts here, the contents of these willfulness requirements differ. The argument is made that while an intent to report and pay the tax in the future does not vitiate the willfulness requirements of 7203 and 7207, it does constitute a defense to a willful attempt \"in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by\" the Internal Revenue Code, in violation of 7201. While we agree that the intent to report the income and pay the tax sometime in the future does not vitiate the willfulness required by 7203 and 7207, we cannot agree that it vitiates the willfulness requirement of 7201.\n\nNo defense to a 7201 evasion charge is made out by showing that the defendant willfully and fraudulently understated his tax liability for the year involved but intended to report the income and pay the tax at some later time. As this Court has recognized, 7201 includes the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a tax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the payment of a tax. Lawn v. United States, supra. The indictment here charged an attempt to evade income taxes by defeating the assessment for 1957. The fact that petitioner stated to a revenue agent that he intended to report his 1957 income in some later year, even if taken at face value, would not detract from the criminality of his willful act defeating the 1957 assessment. That crime was complete as soon as the false and fraudulent understatement of taxes (assuming, of course, that there was in fact a deficiency) was filed. See United States v. Beacon Brass Co., \n344 \nU.S. 43, 46\n. See also Spies v. United States, supra, at 498-499.\n\nIn sum, it is clear here that there were no disputed issues of fact which would justify instructing the jury that it could find that petitioner had committed all the elements \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 355]\n\u00a0\n of either or both of the 7203 and 7207 misdemeanors without having committed a violation of the 7201 felony. This being the case, the petitioner was not entitled to a lesser-included offense charge and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissent, believing that there was evidence sufficient to require the Court to charge the jury, as petitioner requested, that they could acquit him on this felony charge of having willfully attempted to evade or defeat taxes in violation of 7201 but still convict him of the lesser misdemeanor offenses included in the felony charge. See Berra v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 131, 135\n (dissenting opinion). Cf. Achilli v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 373, 379\n (dissenting opinion).\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was charged with a violation of 7201 for 1956 in addition to the charge for 1957. The jury acquitted him with respect to the 1956 charge, which is consequently not involved in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 7207 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides: \"Any person who willfully delivers or discloses to the Secretary or his delegate any list, return, account, statement, or other document, known by him to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides: \"Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return (other than a return required under authority of section 6015 or section 6016), keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The full instructions requested by petitioner were as follows: No. 1. \"Under the law you may find a defendant guilty of a lesser crime than the crimes charged in the indictment. \"A statute upon which a lesser crime is based (Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), omitting that part of the Act which does not apply in this case, reads as follows: \"`Any person required under this title to pay any . . . tax, . . . who willfully fails to pay such tax, . . . at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor.' \"and then the statute provides for the penalty. \"Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that (with respect to either or both of the counts in this indictment) the defendant willfully failed to pay the correct tax to the United States at the time of the filing of his return, but you further find that the defendant did not willfully attempt to defeat and evade his income taxes by the filing of a false and fraudulent return, you will in your verdict say `Guilty of violating a lesser-included offense.' \"If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant willfully failed to pay the correct tax when filing his income tax return or returns under any count or counts of this indictment, you will resolve the doubt in favor of the defendant and acquit him of the lesser-included offense as to such count or counts.\" No. 2. \"As I have said previously, the law permits the jury to find a defendant guilty of any lesser offense which is necessarily included in the crime charged. The offense charged in the indictment here necessarily includes a lesser offense based upon the following statute (Section 7207 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), omitting that part of the Act which does not apply in this case; it reads as follows: \"`Any person who willfully delivers or discloses to the Secretary [of the Treasury] or his delegate any . . . return, . . . or other document known by him to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter,' \"and then the statute provides for the penalty. \"Therefore, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that (with respect to either or both of the counts in this indictment) the defendant \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n willfully delivered to the District Director of Internal Revenue at St. Louis, Missouri his and his wife's federal joint income tax return or returns for the years 1956 and 1957 which were known by him to be fraudulent or false as to any material matter, but you further find that the defendant did not willfully attempt to defeat and evade his income tax by the filing of a false and fraudulent return, you will in your verdict say `Guilty of violating a lesser-included offense.' \"If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant willfully so delivered under any count or counts of this indictment his and his wife's federal joint income tax return or returns which were known by him to be fraudulent or false as to a material matter, you will resolve the doubt in favor of the defendant and acquit him of the lesser-included offense as to such count or counts.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This issue divided the Court of Appeals, with two judges holding that 7207 does not apply to false income tax returns and one judge, concurring in result, dissenting on this point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This Court has long recognized that to hold otherwise would only invite the jury to pick between the felony and the misdemeanor so as to determine the punishment to be imposed, a duty Congress has traditionally left to the judge. See Sparf v. United States, supra, at 63-64; Berra v. United States, supra, at 135. This general principle is particularly applicable in this area. In commenting on 7201, the House Ways and Means Committee expressly stated that minimum penalties were omitted from 7201 in order to make it \"possible for the judges to better fix the penalties to fit the circumstances.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 108. The lack of minimum penalties also, of course, denies to the prosecutor an unbridled discretion as to the penalty to be imposed upon particular defendants by deciding whether, on the same facts, to charge a felony or a misdemeanor. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 343, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCOTT v. GERMANO(1965)\nNo. 1152\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n After invalidating senatorial apportionment provisions in the Illinois Constitution and statutes, a Federal District Court ordered that any corrective provisions be submitted to it before any election thereunder, failing which it would issue a show-cause order as to why State Senators should not be elected at large in 1966 and thereafter. Previously a case had been filed in state court attacking the composition of the legislature which, after the federal court order, the State Supreme Court decided on appeal, holding the State Senate composition invalid. The court expressed confidence that the legislature at its current session would take corrective action and retained jurisdiction to insure that the 1966 election was pursuant to a valid plan. Thereafter appellant here unsuccessfully moved the District Court to vacate its order and stay proceedings in light of the State Supreme Court opinion. Held: Appropriate state action to correct malapportionment is to be encouraged. The District Court order is vacated and the case remanded for the fixing of a reasonable time for valid senatorial redistricting by an agency of the State, including its Supreme Court, before the 1966 election, with retention of jurisdiction by the District Court for appropriate action, including an order for a valid reapportionment plan, failing timely state action.\n\n 241 F.

Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n (1964), the District Court on January 22, 1965, entered a judgment declaring invalid Art. IV, 6, of the Illinois Constitution and Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46, 158-1 to 158-5 (1963), apportioning the Illinois Senate; directing that all members of the Illinois General Assembly be made parties defendant; and requiring that \"any implementation, amendment or substitution of all or part of the said defective portions\" of the Illinois Constitution or legislation be submitted to it for approval before the holding of any election thereunder. It further held that if no such \"implementation, amendment or substitution\" was submitted it would order the parties to show cause why all Illinois State Senators should not be elected from the State at large in the 1966 election and every four years thereafter.\n\nIn April 1964 the case of People ex rel. Engle v. Kerner was filed in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County, Illinois. It contested the composition of both houses of the General Assembly but was dismissed by the trial court. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Illinois on February 4, 1965, held the composition of the Illinois Senate invalid; the court expressed confidence that the General Assembly would \"successfully perform its duty to enact a constitutionally valid plan during its current session\" which expires July 1, 1965. However, the court retained jurisdiction of the case \"for the purpose of taking such affirmative action as may be necessary to insure that the 1966 election is pursuant to a constitutionally valid plan.\" 32 Ill. 2d 212, 225, 205 N. E. 2d 33, 41.\n\nOn February 8, 1965, the appellants here moved that the United States District Court reconsider and vacate its order of January 22, 1965, and stay further proceedings \n\n[381 \nU.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n in light of the Supreme Court of Illinois' opinion in Engle, supra. This the District Court refused to do. Direct appeal was perfected here, 28 U.S.C. 1253 (1958 ed.), and the appellants have now moved to stay the judgment of the District Court.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nWe believe that the District Court should have stayed its hand. The power of the judiciary of a State to require valid reapportionment or to formulate a valid redistricting plan has not only been recognized by this Court but appropriate action by the States in such cases has been specifically encouraged.

Though recognizing that the merger would eliminate competition in parts of Florida, the ICC found that the benefits of the merger outweighed its potential disadvantages. On the ground that the ICC failed to determine whether the merger violated 7 of the Clayton Act by reference to the relevant product and geographic markets, a three-judge District Court set aside the ICC's order. Held: The ICC is authorized to approve a merger notwithstanding what would otherwise be violative of the antitrust laws if it makes adequate findings after weighing the effects of the curtailment of competition against the advantages of improved service that the merger would be \"consistent with the public interest\" under 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act and further the overall transportation policy.

In the administrative proceedings, the applicants contended that the merger would enable them to lower operating costs, improve service, and eliminate duplicate facilities; other carriers opposed the merger on the ground that it would have adverse competitive effects; and the Department of Justice contended that the merger would create a rail monopoly in central and western Florida.\n\nThe Commission approved the merger, subject to routing and gateway conditions to protect competing railroads. It recognized that the merger would eliminate competition and create a rail monopoly in parts of Florida. But it found that the merged lines carried only a small part of the total traffic in the area involved; that ample rail competition would remain therein; and that the reduction in competition would \"have no appreciably injurious effect upon shippers and communities.\" Seaboard Air Line Railroad Co., 320 I. C. C. 122, 167. In addition, the Commission noted that the need to preserve intramodal rail competition had diminished, due to the fact that railroads were increasingly losing traffic to truck, water, and other modes of competition.\n\nA three-judge District Court set aside the order and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings. It concluded that the Commission's analysis of the competitive effects of the merger was fatally defective because the Commission had not determined whether \n\n[382 \nU.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n the merger violated 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 18 (1964 ed.), by reference to the relevant product and geographic markets. By thus disposing of the case, the District Court did not reach the ultimate question whether the merger would be consistent with the public interest despite the foreseeable injury to competition.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nWe believe that the District Court erred in its interpretation of the directions this Court set forth in McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67\n (1944), and Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 173\n (1959). As we said in Minneapolis, at 186:\n\n\"Although 5 (11) does not authorize the Commission to `ignore' the antitrust laws, McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67, 80\n, there can be `little doubt that the Commission is not to measure proposals for [acquisitions] by the standards of the antitrust laws.' \n321 \nU.S., at 85\n-86. The problem is one of accommodation of 5 (2) and the antitrust legislation. The Commission remains obligated to `estimate the scope and appraise the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from the proposed [acquisition] and consider them along with the advantages of improved service [and other matters in the public interest] to determine whether the [acquisition] will assist in effectuating the overall transportation policy.' \n321 \nU.S., at 87\n.\"\n\n\n The same criteria should be applied here to the proposed merger. It matters not that the merger might \n\n[382 \nU.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n otherwise violate the antitrust laws; the Commission has been authorized by the Congress to approve the merger of railroads if it makes adequate findings in accordance with the criteria quoted above that such a merger would be \"consistent with the public interest.\" 54 Stat. 906, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2) (b) (1964 ed.).\n\nWhether the Commission has confined itself within the statutory limits upon its discretion and has based its findings on substantial evidence are questions for the trial court in the first instance, United States v.

AMERICAN TRAILER RENTALS(1965)\nNo. 35\nArgued: November 10, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent company, which was in the trailer rental business, was financed by arranging for the sale of trailers to investors on a lease-back agreement. The trailers were placed by respondent at hundreds of gasoline stations which acted as rental agents. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) blocked the further offering of the sale and lease-back agreements without a registration statement, which never became effective. Respondent's vice president then formed a new corporation which sought to exchange its stock for the investor creditors' trailers, but the SEC suspended the exemption from registration for small offerings because there was reasonable cause to believe there were false statements in the material used in making the offer. Respondent then filed a petition and proposed plan of arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The petition showed that respondent never operated at a profit, that it owed large sums to trailer investors, that it made payments to investors whose trailers had not been obtained, that it purchased all trailers from an affiliate which had gone bankrupt owing it money, that 100 trailers were lost, and that substantial funds had been misappropriated. The SEC filed a motion under 328 of the Bankruptcy Act to transfer the proceeding to Chapter X. A referee in bankruptcy, acting as special master, recommended denial of the motion on the ground that the SEC had not made a sufficient showing. The District Court, although though expressing disapproval of the proposed stock arrangement and the preferential treatment of unsecured bank loans, accepted the referee's findings and denied the motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in this borderline case and the SEC did not show that adequate relief was not available under Chapter XI. Held:\n\n 1. In Chapters X and XI Congress enacted two distinct methods of corporate rehabilitation which are mutually exclusive. Pp. 604-607. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (a) Chapter X affords greater protection to creditors and stockholders by providing judicial control over the entire proceedings and impartial and expert assistance in corporate reorganizations through disinterested trustees and the active participation of the SEC. Pp. 604-605.\n\n\n  (b) Chapter XI is a summary procedure, usually under the control of the debtor, limited to an adjustment of unsecured debts, with only a bare minimum of control or supervision. Pp. 605-607.\n\n\n  (c) These are not alternate routes, with the choice in the debtor's hands. P. 607.\n\n\n  (d) A Chapter X petition may not be filed unless \"adequate relief\" is not obtainable under Chapter XI. P. 607.\n\n\n  (e) A Chapter XI petition is to be dismissed, or in effect transferred, if the proceedings should have been brought under Chapter X. P. 607.\n\n\n 2. While there is no absolute rule that Chapter X be used in every case in which the debtor is publicly owned, or where publicly held debt is adjusted, as a general rule Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for adjusting publicly held debt. SEC v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n, followed. Pp. 613-614.\n\n\n  (a) Public investors are generally widely scattered and are far less likely than trade creditors to be aware of the financial condition and cause of the collapse of the debtor; they are less commonly organized in groups or committees capable of protecting their interests; they do not have the same interest as do trade creditors in continuing the business relations with the debtor; and, where debt is publicly held, the SEC is likely to have become familiar with the debtor's finances, indicating the desirability of its performing its full Chapter X functions. Pp. 613-614.\n\n\n  (b) In enacting Chapter X Congress had the protection of public investors, and not trade creditors, primarily in mind. P. 614.\n\n\n 3. There are only narrow limits within which there are exceptions to this general rule that the rights of public investor creditors are to be adjusted only under Chapter X. \"Simple\" compositions are still to be effected under Chapter XI; such situations may exist even where public debt is directly affected, for example, where the public investors are few in number and familiar with the operations of the debtor, or where, although the public investors are greater in number, the adjustment of their debt is relatively minor. P. 614. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 596]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 4. Even where there is no public debt problem, Chapter X is appropriate where there are widespread public stockholders needing the protection offered thereby, such as accounting for mismanagement or obtaining a change in management, or where the financial condition requires more than a simple composition of unsecured debts. General Stores Corp. v. Shlensky, \n350 \nU.S. 462\n, followed. Pp. 614-615.\n\n\n 5. Here, where public debts are being adjusted; the investors are many, widespread, and not intimately connected with the debtor; and the adjustment is major, it is obvious on the above-stated principles that Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for the debtor's attempted rehabilitation. P. 615.\n\n\n 6. The contention that Chapter X is not here appropriate as the time and expense involved in such a proceeding would be too great is just another way of stating the natural preference of a debtor's management for the \"speed and economy\" of Chapter XI to the \"thoroughness and disinterestedness\" of Chapter X, which preference has been rejected by the determination of Congress that the disinterested protection of the public investor outweighs the self-interest \"needs\" of corporate management for so-called \"speed and economy.\" Pp. 617-618.\n\n\n  (a) Experience in this area has confirmed the view of Congress that the thoroughness and disinterestedness assured by Chapter X not only results in greater protection for the investing public, but often in greater ultimate savings for all interests, public and private, than does the so-called \"speed and economy\" of Chapter XI. Pp. 617-618.\n\n\n  (b) The requirements of Chapter X are themselves sufficiently flexible so that the District Court can act to keep expenses within proper bounds and insure expedition in the proceedings. P. 618.\n\n\n  (c) Chapters X and XI were not designed to prolong - without good reason and at the expense of the investing public - the corporate life of every debtor suffering from terminal financial ills. P. 618.\n\n\n 7. District courts do not have open-ended discretion to decide in each case whether it is better for a debtor to be in Chapter X or Chapter XI, but must decide the issue pursuant to the principles here reaffirmed. Pp. 619-620.\n\n\n 325 F.2d 47, reversed and remanded. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 597]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDaniel M. Friedman argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Philip A. Loomis, Jr., and David Ferber.\n\nArthur W. Burke, Jr., argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMarcien Jenckes argued the cause and filed a brief for the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America et al., as amici curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe issue in this case is whether respondent's attempted corporate rehabilitation under the Bankruptcy Act, materially affecting the rights of widespread public investor creditors, may be conducted under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 52 Stat. 905, as amended, 11 U.S.C. 701 et seq. (1958 ed.), or whether dismissal or, in effect, transfer to proceedings under Chapter X of that Act, 52 Stat. 883, as amended, 11 U.S.C. 501 et seq. (1958 ed.), is required upon motion by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other party in interest, pursuant to 328 of the Bankruptcy Act, 66 Stat. 432, 11 U.S.C. 728 (1958 ed.).\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 598]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nRespondent, American Trailer Rentals Company, was organized in 1958 to engage in the automobile-trailer rental business.\n2\n The business was financed largely through the sale of trailers to investors and their simultaneous lease-back. From 1959 to 1961 hundreds of small investors, scattered throughout the entire western part of the United States, purchased and leased back a total of 5,866 trailers, paying an aggregate price of $3,587,439 (approximately $600 per trailer). Under the usual form of lease-back agreement, the trailer owners were to receive a set 2% of their investment per month for 10 years.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe trailers sold to investors and then leased back are of the general utility type that are attached to the rear bumper of automobiles. They were placed by respondent at gasoline stations, the operators of which acted as respondent's rental agents, without the investors ever having seen them. Respondent had about 700 such service station operators in December 1961, although the number had declined to about 500 by the time the petition for an arrangement was filed a year later.\n\nRespondent's further offering of these sale and lease back arrangements to the public was halted in 1961, when the SEC advised respondent that these sale and lease back arrangements were investment contracts and therefore securities, which could not be sold to the public unless and until a registration statement was filed and became \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 599]\n\u00a0\n effective under the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. (1958 ed.). Respondent then filed a registration statement with the SEC pertaining to these sale and lease-back arrangements. This registration statement, however, never became effective, and proceedings were instituted by the SEC to stop distribution of respondent's proposed prospectus on the grounds that it contained false and misleading statements. See Securities Act of 1933, 8 (d), 48 Stat. 79, 15 U.S.C. 77h (d) (1958 ed.). In June 1963, respondent consented to the entry of an order stopping distribution of this prospectus. See SEC, Securities Act Release No. 4615 (1963).\n\nAfter this attempt to register the sale and lease-back agreements had failed, respondent's executive vice president and other persons organized a corporation named Capitol Leasing Corporation, which offered respondent's investor creditors an exchange of its stock for their trailers on the basis of one share of its stock for each $2 the investor creditors had paid for the trailers. After Capitol had acquired approximately 300 of the 5,866 trailers outstanding in exchange for its stock, the SEC suspended the exemption from registration for small offerings, upon which Capitol had relied in making this offer,\n4\n on the grounds that there was reasonable cause to believe that the material used in making this offer again contained false and misleading statements.\n\nFollowing this event, respondent filed a petition and a proposed plan of arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. The petition, annexed schedules, and other documents show that respondent had never operated at a profit. For the three years ended September \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 600]\n\u00a0\n 30, 1961, it had an aggregate income from \"gross rentals\" of $395,610. In the same period, it made rental payments to investor-trailer owners of $613,021; made payments to gasoline station operators of $118,400; and incurred additional \"operating expenses\" of $668,698.\n\nThe $613,021 paid to trailer owners included payments to investors whose trailers had not yet been obtained and put into the system. In order to make the necessary payments to trailer owners and station operators, respondent had not only borrowed money from its officers, directors, and stockholders but also had used funds obtained for purchase of new trailers. Virtually all the trailers were purchased from an affiliate in which respondent's officers and directors had interests. Many of these trailers proved defective in design or otherwise unsuitable for rental. About a year prior to the filing of respondent's Chapter XI proceeding, this manufacturing affiliate became bankrupt, owing respondent approximately $200,000 for trailers that were never manufactured and an additional amount of approximately $150,000 for trailers that were manufactured but never delivered. These latter trailers had been mortgaged by the affiliate to a third party who took possession upon the affiliate's bankruptcy. In addition, in June 1961, some 100 trailers, as to which respondent, although obligated by the lease-back arrangements to do so, did not have insurance coverage, were unlocatable and considered lost. Finally, certain funds received from investors for the purchase of trailers had been, at an earlier period, misappropriated by a member or members of respondent's management. Respondent's executive vice president, who estimated this misappropriation loss to be at least $141,000, attributed it \"almost completely\" to a deceased member of the original management group, but did not feel \"qualified to make [the] judgment\" that the two remaining members \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 601]\n\u00a0\n of that group, including one who owned over 15% of respondent's common stock, could be held liable.\n\nAt the time of filing its Chapter XI petition, respondent stated its total assets as $685,608, of which $500,000 represented the stated estimated \"value\" of its trailer-rental system, an intangible asset. It stated in its petition that its trailer-rental system (which then consisted of arrangements with some 500 service station operator agents) \"was built by [respondent] at an estimated cost of $500,000,\" despite the fact that respondent's balance sheet in 1961 showed the cost of establishing a system of 700 stations as only $33,750, and that in 1961 respondent had estimated that the cost of establishing an additional 800 rental stations would be only $56,000. The total liabilities were stated at $1,367,890, of which $710,597 was owed to trailer owners under their leasing agreements; $200,677 was owed to the investors who had paid for trailers that had never been manufactured; $71,805 was owed to trade and other general creditors; and $285,277 was owed to respondent's officers and directors.\n\nUnder the proposed plan of arrangement submitted by respondent the investor-trailer owners were to exchange their entire interests (their rights in the trailers as well as the amounts owed them under the rental agreements) for stock of Capitol on the basis of one share of stock for each $2 of \"remaining capital investment in the trailers,\" which sum was to be determined by deducting from the original purchase price of the trailers the amount, if any, which the owners had received as rental payments.\n5\n Respondent's officers and directors, as well as trade and other general creditors, were to receive one share of stock \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 602]\n\u00a0\n for each $3.50 of their claims. Respondent, itself, in exchange for transferring to Capitol its trailer-rental system, was to receive 107,000 shares which it would then distribute to its stockholders. Finally, obligations to two banks, totaling $55,558, although clearly unsecured, were to be paid in full, presumably because the officers and directors of respondent would otherwise have been liable as guarantors of these obligations.\n\nIf this plan were approved and all of the investor-trailer owners participated, a total of approximately 866,000 shares of Capitol's stock would be issued to them, but approximately 81,500 shares would be issued directly to the officers and directors of respondent, 22,400 to trade and other general creditors, and 107,000 to respondent itself to be distributed to its stockholders. More than 60% of respondent's stock was held by eight men, seven of whom are officers and directors and the eighth one of the original promoters of the venture.\n\nThe SEC then filed a motion, under 328 of the Bankruptcy Act, to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding or, in effect, transfer it to Chapter X on the ground that it should have been brought under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act and thus Chapter XI is not available. A referee in bankruptcy to whom, as a special master, the motion was referred, recommended that it be denied on the grounds that the Commission had not made \"a sufficient showing to warrant the granting of the Section 328 motion.\" At his hearing on this matter, the District Judge recognized that, in light of the fact that the investor-trailer owners were widely scattered and the nature of their individual holdings was small, the proposed plan's issuance of approximately 15% of Capitol's stock to respondent's officers and directors would mean that they, rather than the investor-trailer owners, would have effective control over Capitol, and expressed his \"disapproval\" of such a result. He also expressed disapproval \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 603]\n\u00a0\n of preferential treatment of the banks in order to avoid the obligations of the officer and director guarantors.\n6\n The District Court, however, \"accepted and adopted\" the referee's findings and denied the motion without a written opinion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, \"since the granting of the motion rests in the discretion of the [district] court, while we think this is a border-line case, it does not appear that the S. E. C. has shown that adequate relief is not obtainable in Chapter XI proceedings or that there has been an abuse of that discretion warranting reversal.\" 325 F.2d 47, 52. We granted certiorari, \n376 \nU.S. 948\n.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe background and operative procedures of Chapter X and Chapter XI and the interrelationship between them have been reviewed by this Court in SEC v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434\n, and General Stores Corp. v. Shlensky, \n350 \nU.S. 462\n. This background was detailed in United States Realty, supra, as follows:\n\nBefore passage, in 1934, of 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 48 Stat. 912, bankruptcy procedures offered no facilities for corporate rehabilitation, which, therefore, was left to equity receiverships, with their attendant paraphernalia of creditors' and security holders' committees, and of rival plans of reorganization. Lack of judicial control of the conditions attending formulation of the plans, inadequate protection of widely scattered security holders, frequent adoption of plans which favored \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 604]\n\u00a0\n management at the expense of other interests and which afforded the corporation only temporary respite from financial collapse, so often characteristic of equity receivership reorganizations, led to the enactment of 77B. See S. Doc. No. 65, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., 90; H. R. Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2. As does the present Chapter X, 77B permitted the adjustment of all interests in the debtor, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and stockholders.\n\nThe day preceding the enactment of 77B, Congress had created the Securities and Exchange Commission as a special agency charged with the function of protecting the investing public, 48 Stat. 885, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78d (1958 ed.). At the urging of, and based on extensive studies by the SEC, 77B was, in 1938, revised and enacted in changed form as Chapter X. 52 Stat. 883-905. The aims of Chapter X as thus revised were to afford greater protection to creditors and stockholders by providing greater judicial control over the entire proceedings and impartial and expert administrative assistance in corporate reorganizations through appointment of a disinterested trustee and the active participation of the SEC. The trustee in a Chapter X proceeding\n7\n is required to make a thorough examination and study of the debtor's financial problems and management, Bankruptcy Act, 167 (3), (5), and then transmit his independent report to the creditors, stockholders, the SEC, and others. Following this, the trustee gives notice to all creditors and stockholders to submit to him proposals for a plan of reorganization. 167 (5), (6). The trustee then formulates a plan of reorganization which he presents to the court. If the court finds the plan worthy of consideration, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 605]\n\u00a0\n it may refer it to the SEC for its opinion and must so refer it where the debtor's liabilities exceed $3,000,000. 172. When the proposed plan, after approval by the court, is finally submitted to the debtor's creditors and stockholders, it is accompanied by the advisory report of the SEC, as well as the opinion of the judge who approved the plan. 175. As to each class of creditors and stockholders whose rights are affected by the plan, the plan must receive the approval of the holders of two-thirds in amount of each class of creditors' claims and, if the debtor has not been found to be insolvent, the holders of a majority of each class of stock. 179. The plan becomes effective upon final confirmation by the court, based on a finding, inter alia, that \"the plan is fair and equitable.\" 221.\n\nAs part of the same Act in which Chapter X was enacted Congress also, in 1938, enacted Chapter XI. 52 Stat. 905-916. Chapter XI is a statutory variation of the common-law composition of creditors and, unlike the broader scope of Chapter X, is limited to an adjustment of unsecured debts. It was sponsored by the National Association of Credit Men and other groups of creditors' representatives whose experience had been in representing trade creditors in small and middle-sized commercial failures. See Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 6439 (reintroduced as H. R. 8046 and enacted in 1938), 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 31, 35; 13 J. N. A. Ref. Bankr. 17 (1938). The contrast between the provisions of Chapter X, carefully designed to protect the creditor and stockholder interests involved, and the summary provisions of Chapter XI is quite marked. The formulation of the plan of arrangement, and indeed the entire Chapter XI proceeding, for all practical purposes is in the hands of the debtor, subject only to the requisite consent of a majority in number and amount of unsecured \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 606]\n\u00a0\n creditors, 362, and the ultimate finding by the court that the plan is, inter alia, \"for the best interests of the creditors,\" 366.\n8\n \"The process of formulating an arrangement and the solicitation of consent of creditors, sacrifices to speed and economy every safeguard, in the interest of thoroughness and distinterestedness, provided in Chapter X.\" United States Realty, supra, at 450-451. The debtor generally remains in possession and operates the business under court supervision, 342. A trustee is only provided in the very limited situation where a trustee in bankruptcy has previously been appointed,\n9\n 332. There is no requirement for a receiver, but the Court \"may\" appoint one if it finds it to be \"necessary,\" 332. The plan of arrangement is proposed by, and only by, the debtor, 306 (1), 323, 357, and creditors have only the choice of accepting or rejecting it. Acceptances may be solicited by the debtor even before filing of the Chapter XI petition and, in fact, must be solicited before court review of the plan, 336 (4). There are no provisions for an independent study by the court or a trustee, or for advice by them being given to creditors in advance of the acceptance of the arrangement. In short, Chapter XI provides a summary procedure whereby judicial confirmation is obtained on a plan that has been formulated and accepted with only a bare minimum of independent control or supervision. This, of course, is consistent with the basic purpose of Chapter XI: to provide a quick and economical means of facilitating simple compositions among general creditors who have been \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 607]\n\u00a0\n deemed by Congress to need only the minimal disinterested protection provided by that Chapter.\n\nIn enacting these two distinct methods of corporate rehabilitations, Congress has made it quite clear that Chapters X and XI are not alternate routes, the choice of which is in the hands of the debtor. Rather, they are legally, mutually exclusive paths to attempted financial rehabilitation. A Chapter X petition may not be filed unless \"adequate relief\" is not obtainable under Chapter XI, 146 (2). Likewise, a Chapter XI petition is to be dismissed, or in effect transferred, if the proceedings \"should have been brought\" under Chapter X, 328.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe SEC here contends that, as an absolute rule, all proceedings for the financial rehabilitation of a corporate debtor which would alter the rights of public investor creditors must be in Chapter X. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that there is no such absolute rule and that the determination of whether proceedings, on the facts of a particular case, should be in Chapter X or in Chapter XI rests in the discretion of the District Court, which discretion should not be reversed unless it is found to have been clearly abused. Both parties rely on United States Realty, supra, and General Stores Corp., supra, for their respective contentions.\n\nUnited States Realty involved a corporation with publicly owned debentures, publicly owned mortgage certificates, and publicly owned stock, which proposed a plan of arrangement that would have left the debentures and stock unaffected but would have both extended the time for payment of the publicly held mortgage certificates and reduced their interest rate. The SEC there argued that Chapter X is the exclusive avenue for financial rehabilitation of large corporations with many stock-holders. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 608]\n\u00a0\n While rejecting this argument as an absolute matter, the Court recognized that \"in general . . . the two chapters were specifically devised to afford different procedures, the one [Chapter X] adapted to the reorganization of corporations with complicated debt structures and many stockholders, the other [Chapter XI] to composition of debts of small individual business and corporations with few stockholders . . . .\" \n310 \nU.S., at 447\n. The Court then held that, as the proposed plan of arrangement adversely affected the rights of many, widely scattered public creditors, to wit, the holders of mortgage certificates, the formulation of a plan with the judicial control, statutory SEC participation, and employment of disinterested trustees, assured by Chapter X, would better serve \"the public and private interests concerned including those of the debtor,\" id., at 455, than would the formulation of a Chapter XI plan under the almost complete control of the debtor. In reaching this result, the Court explored at great length the safeguards of Chapter X and their protection of public investors:\n\n \"The basic assumption of Chapter X and other acts administered by the Commission is that the investing public dissociated from control or active participation in the management, needs impartial and expert administrative assistance in the ascertainment of facts, in the detection of fraud, and in the understanding of complex financial problems.\" Id., at 448-449, n. 6.\n\n\n Applying these principles, the Court therefore reversed the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the District Court's refusal to dismiss a Chapter XI proceeding which the SEC had challenged on the grounds that it should have been brought under Chapter X.\n\nIt should be noted that, prior to United States Realty, a bill had been introduced in Congress to draw a numerical \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 609]\n\u00a0\n line that would close Chapter XI to any corporation which had any class of its securities owned by 100 or more creditors or stockholders. See Hearing before Special Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and Reorganization of the House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 9864, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. In reporting out the bill, the Subcommittee stated:\n\n \"Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the bill, which are eliminated by the last of your committee's amendments, provided for amendments to chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act which were designed to prevent corporations which are publicly indebted or owned from filing a petition for an arrangement under chapter XI, rather than a petition for reorganization under chapter X, the chapter specially designed for the reorganization of such corporations, and to establish a numerical test of such `public' indebtedness or ownership.\n\n\n \"Your committee believes that, while the amendments proposed by sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 are desirable, the element of emergency requiring their immediate passage has been eliminated by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Commission v. U.S. Realty and Improvement Company. That decision was rendered on May 27, 1940, after the introduction of the bill. Since immediate action on these proposals does not appear to be necessary, the last of your committee's amendments provides for the striking out of sections 4, 5, 6, and 7. The committee's conclusion is supported by all of the witnesses who testified at the hearings before the committee's Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and Reorganization and also by the report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the bill.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2372, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 610]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In General Stores Corp. v. Shlensky, supra, a corporation with over 2,000,000 shares of common stock, held by over 7,000 shareholders, but with no publicly held debt of any kind, petitioned under Chapter XI for an arrangement of its unsecured debt, consisting of obligations to trade creditors and one private investor. The District Court had held, with the Court of Appeals affirming, that Chapter XI was unavailable as the debtor needed more extensive reorganization than merely a simple arrangement with unsecured creditors. This Court affirmed. In so doing, the Court again rejected the SEC's argument that, as an absolute matter, Chapter XI is not available where the debtor is publicly owned.\n\nThe Court stated:\n\n\"It may well be that in most cases where the debtor's securities are publicly held c. X will afford the more appropriate remedy. But that is not necessarily so. A large company with publicly held securities may have as much need for a simple composition of unsecured debts as a smaller company. And there is no reason we can see why c. XI may not serve that end. The essential difference is not between the small company and the large company but between the needs to be served.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 466\n.\n\n\n The Court pointed out that the \"needs to be served\" included such factors as requirements of fairness to public debt holders, need for a trustee's evaluation of an accounting from management or determination that new management is necessary, and the need to readjust a complicated debt structure requiring more than a simple composition of unsecured debt. Id., at 466-467.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nWe agree with the parties that the principles of United States Realty and General Stores apply to and govern the result in this case. We reaffirm the holdings of these \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 611]\n\u00a0\n cases that there is no absolute rule that Chapter X must be utilized in every case in which the corporate debtor is publicly owned. As this Court has recognized, Congress has drawn no such hard-and-fast line between the two Chapters. The SEC, purporting to bow to these holdings, urges in this case, however, a variation of its absolute-rule argument that, while not requiring Chapter X in all cases in which the debtor is publicly owned, would require the use of Chapter X in 100% of the cases involving the rights of public investor creditors.\n\nIt argues, in support of this variation of its absolute rule, that to hold otherwise would deprive the investor creditors of Chapter X's protection of the \"fair and equitable\" requirement of a plan. As noted above, whereas Chapter X contains the proviso that a plan must be \"fair and equitable,\" Chapter XI only requires that it be \"for the best interests of the creditors.\" The words \"fair and equitable\" are \"words of art\" which mean that senior interests are entitled to full priority over junior ones and, in particular, \"that in any plan of corporate reorganization unsecured creditors are entitled to priority over stock-holders to the full extent of their debts and that any scaling down of the claims of creditors without some fair compensating advantage to them which is prior to the rights of stockholders is inadmissible.\" United States Realty, supra, at 452. The SEC's argument, however, is premised on the assertion, for which we can find no support in either the language or legislative history of Chapters X and XI, that Congress has deemed it necessary in all cases involving public investor creditors that they have the protection of the \"fair and equitable\" doctrine. In fact, the requirement that a plan be \"fair and equitable\" was part of Chapter XI, as well as Chapter X, until 1952, when Congress deleted it from Chapter XI and replaced it with the requirement that the plan be \"for the best interests of the creditors.\" Congress clearly deemed this \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 612]\n\u00a0\n latter requirement to be sufficient protection in a proceeding properly in Chapter XI in light of the general philosophy of Chapter XI to expedite \"simple\" compositions. See S. Rep. No. 1395, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 10, 11-12; H. R. Rep. No. 2320, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 19, 20-21. There is no indication that in so doing, Congress intended in any way to change the law on the interrelationship between Chapters X and XI. In fact, the history is just the opposite.\n10\n In the same Act that deleted the \"fair and equitable\" requirement from Chapter XI, Congress expressly codified, in 328, the rule of United States Realty providing for dismissal, or, in effect transfer, of a Chapter XI proceeding if it \"should have been brought\" in Chapter X. Nothing in this even suggests transfer as an absolute rule to give Chapter X's \"fair and equitable\" protection to all cases involving public investors, which presumably if Congress had so intended, it would have so stated. Moreover, as noted above, supra, pp. 608-609, a House subcommittee previously approved the United States Realty holding of a general, but not absolute, rule, and had not reported out a bill that would have drawn an absolute line.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe SEC further argues that Chapter X is required in all cases involving public investor creditors, because its right to intervene in a Chapter XI proceeding is limited solely to moving under 328 for a transfer to Chapter X. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 613]\n\u00a0\n We reject this argument. The District Court, in this case, quite properly recognized that the SEC was not so limited in a Chapter XI proceeding, and we hold that, under the statutory scheme, while not charged with express statutory rights and responsibilities as in Chapter X, the SEC is entitled to intervene and be heard in a Chapter XI proceeding. We therefore reject the SEC's variation of its absolute-rule argument, advanced in this case, that would require the use of Chapter X in all cases in which the rights of public investor creditors are involved. The short answer is that, as with the SEC's original absolute-rule argument, Congress has drawn no such absolute line of demarcation between Chapters X and XI.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that we disagree with the holding of United States Realty that, although there is no absolute rule requiring that Chapter X be utilized in every case in which the debtor is publicly owned, or even where publicly held debt is adjusted, as a general rule Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for adjustment of publicly held debt. See SEC v. Canandaigua Enterprises Corp., 339 F.2d 14 (C. A. 2d Cir.). Not only do we not disagree with this holding, but we expressly reaffirm it.\n12\n Public investors are, as here, generally widely scattered and are far less likely than trade creditors to be aware of the financial condition and cause \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 614]\n\u00a0\n of the collapse of the debtor. They are less commonly organized in groups or committees capable of protecting their interests. They do not have the same interest as do trade creditors in continuing the business relations with the debtor. Where debt is publicly held, the SEC is likely, as here, to have become familiar with the debtor's finances, indicating the desirability of its performing its full Chapter X functions. It seems clear that in enacting Chapter X Congress had the protection of public investors, and not trade creditors, primarily in mind. As noted above, Chapter X is one of many Acts in which the SEC has the statutory right and responsibility to protect public investors.\n13\n Finally, again it is clear that Congress was thinking of Chapter XI as primarily concerned with adjustment of the rights of trade creditors when it deemed the \"fair and equitable\" doctrine to be unnecessary to \"simple\" compositions in Chapter XI.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nGeneral Stores indicates the narrow limits within which there are exceptions to this general rule that the rights of public investor creditors are to be adjusted only under Chapter X. \"Simple\" compositions are still to be effected under Chapter XI. Such a situation, even where public debt is directly affected may exist, for example, where the public investors are few in number and familiar with the operations of the debtor, or where, although the public investors are greater in number, the adjustment of their debt is relatively minor, consisting, for example, of a short extension of time for payment.\n\nOn the other hand, General Stores also makes it clear that even though there may be no public debt materially \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 615]\n\u00a0\n and directly affected, Chapter X is still the appropriate proceeding where the debtor has widespread public stockholders and the protections of the public and private interests involved afforded by Chapter X are required because, for example, there is evidence of management misdeeds for which an accounting might be made, there is a need for new management, or the financial condition of the debtor requires more than a simple composition of its unsecured debts.\n\nApplying the above principles, it is obvious that Chapter X is the appropriate proceeding for the attempted rehabilitation of respondent in this case. Here public debts are being adjusted. The investors are many and widespread, not few in number intimately connected with the debtor, and the adjustment is quite major and certainly not minor. These facts alone would require Chapter X proceedings under the above-stated principles. In addition there is here, as we have previously pointed out, substantial evidence of misappropriation of assets, and not only is there a need for a complete corporate reorganization, but it is obvious that the proposed plan of arrangement is just that. The trailer owners are exchanging their entire interests, including a sale of their trailers, in exchange for stock in a new corporation, in which other creditors of respondent, including respondent's officers and directors, as well as respondent itself will have substantial interests. Indeed, this is the same complete reorganization, except that the plan here gives the public investor creditors even less than was previously offered, see note 5, supra, that the SEC previously stopped as a public offering on the grounds that the offering material contained false and misleading information. The Court of Appeals itself recognized, 325 F.2d, at 53, \"that if the stock involved here were not part of an arrangement, the disclosures made with regard to it [in soliciting the trailer owners' consents to the plan] would be clearly \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 616]\n\u00a0\n inadequate. No authority has been found which would indicate that recipients of stock issued in connection with an arrangement are not entitled to as much information as are those persons acquiring stock under ordinary conditions.\" We agree.\n\nIndeed, the facts of this case aptly demonstrate the need for Chapter X protection as a general rule on the above-stated principles. There is clearly a need for a study by a disinterested trustee to make a thorough examination of respondent's financial problems and management and submit a full report to the public-investor creditors. Respondent has never operated profitably, has always been in precarious financial condition, and apparently was hopelessly insolvent, in both the bankruptcy and equity sense, when the arrangement was proposed. At an earlier period, its management apparently misappropriated substantial corporate funds. Most of the trailers were purchased from an affiliated company; a large number of them, although paid for, were either not manufactured or, if manufactured, were not delivered. The affiliated company is bankrupt. Only approximately two-thirds of the $3,587,439 contributed by the public investors for the purchase of trailers was used for that purpose; the balance apparently having been drained off in high commissions taken by the management on the sale of the trailers to the public. Portions of these commissions on new trailer sales were, in turn, used by the management to pay prior purchasers of trailers the rentals which they had been promised. When respondent filed its petition for an arrangement, its stated liabilities of $1,367,890 were approximately double its stated assets of $685,608; with even most of the latter ($500,000) representing the alleged \"estimated\" value of the trailer-rental system, i. e., the debtor's arrangements with the service station operators. The District Court itself recognized that \"there may be in this situation need \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 617]\n\u00a0\n for new management, and there certainly is some question . . . as to whether or not the management that is presently . . . operating it, would continue to do so for the best interests of the investors.\" It did not find, however, that Chapter X was necessary since this need for new management had \"not been clearly established yet.\" One of the purposes of Chapter X is to give the independent trustee the opportunity to conduct a searching inquiry so as to \"clearly establish\" whether or not new management is necessary, when there is, as here, a substantial basis for such a belief. See General Stores, supra, at 466. Finally, it is clear that there is need for an independent investigation of possible causes of action against the past and present management of respondent, and it is as true now as when Chapter X was enacted, that \"a debtor in possession cannot be expected to investigate itself.\" Hearings before House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R. 6439, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 176 (my Brother DOUGLAS then testifying as Chairman of the SEC).\n\nRespondent, however, contends that Chapter X is not here appropriate as the time and expense involved in such a proceeding would be too great. This is, however, just another way of stating the natural preference of a debtor's management for the \"speed and economy\" of Chapter XI, to the \"thoroughness and disinterestedness\" of Chapter X. In this area, as with other statutes designed to protect the investing public.\n15\n Congress has made the determination that the disinterested protection of the public investor outweighs the self-interest \"needs\" of corporate management for so-called \"speed and economy.\" In fact, experience in this area has confirmed the view of Congress that the thoroughness and disinterestedness assured by Chapter X not only result in greater protection \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 618]\n\u00a0\n for the investing public, but often in greater ultimate savings for all interests, public and private, than do the so-called \"speed and economy\" of Chapter XI. See Twenty-Eighth Annual Report of the SEC 98 (1963); Twenty-Ninth Annual Report of the SEC 90-91 (1964); Note, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 352, 357-360 (1955). Moreover, the requirements of Chapter X are themselves sufficiently flexible so that the District Court can act to keep expenses within proper bounds and insure expedition in the proceedings.\n16\n We also reject respondent's further argument that the time and expense of a Chapter X proceeding would be so great that the ultimate result might be straight bankruptcy liquidation, which, respondent contends, \"would mean probable total loss for [the] trailer owners.\" In addition to the above answers to respondent's general-time-and-expense argument, we feel compelled to point out, without indicating any opinion as to the ultimate outcome of the attempted financial rehabilitation in this case, that it must be recognized that Chapters X and XI were not designed to prolong - without good reason and at the expense of the investing public - the corporate life of every debtor suffering from terminal financial ills. See Fidelity Assurance Assn. v. Sims, \n318 \nU.S. 608\n.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 619]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, respondent argues that the District Court's decision that Chapter XI was the appropriate proceeding here should be affirmed on the basis that it was not a clear abuse of discretion. Respondent relies on certain language in the General Stores opinion in support of this contention. However, in making this contention it clearly misreads that opinion and misconceives its holding and import. Nothing in that opinion supports respondent's view that the issue of whether Chapter X or Chapter XI is required permits open-ended discretion by a district court to decide on a case-by-case basis, without reliance on the principles which we have here reaffirmed, whether in its opinion it would be better for a particular debtor to be in Chapter X or Chapter XI.\n18\n We agree with the statement of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a recent decision that such open-ended \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 620]\n\u00a0\n discretion would be bound to result in decisions reflecting the \"particular experience and predilections\" of the district judge involved. SEC v. Canandaigua Enterprises Corp., supra, at 19. \"The consequence, particularly in a multijudge district, would be that the substantial rights of the parties would depend on the accident of the calendar - in defiance of the memorable admonition, `It will not do to decide the same question one way between one set of litigants and the opposite way between another,' Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 33 (1921).\" Ibid. We therefore also reject this contention of respondent.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nApplying the above-stated principles, it is clear that in this case the motion by the SEC to dismiss, or, in effect, to transfer the proceedings to Chapter X, should have been granted.\n20\n Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The judge may, upon application of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any party in interest, and upon such notice to the debtor, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to such other persons as the judge may direct, if he finds that the proceedings should have been brought under chapter 10 of this title, enter an order dismissing the proceedings under this chapter, unless, within such time as the judge shall fix, the petition be amended to comply with the requirement of chapter 10 of this title for the filing of a debtor's petition or a creditors' petition under such chapter, be filed. Upon the filing of such amended petition, or of such creditors' petition, and the payment of such additional fees as may be required to comply with section 532 of this title, such amended petition or creditors' petition shall thereafter, for all purposes of chapter 10 of this title, be deemed to have been originally filed under such chapter.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondent was originally one of a group of interrelated companies that later merged into it; for simplicity we have considered it as one company throughout its history.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Although the overwhelming majority of the agreements are of this type, they vary from 2% to 3% per month and from 5 to 10 years. A few provide for a flat 35% of the rental derived from the trailers involved.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 et seq.), promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, 3 (a), 48 Stat. 75, 15 U.S.C. 77c (a) (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This is, of course, less than the exchange that Capitol had offered some months earlier under the exemption from registration which had been suspended, since there trailer owners had been offered one share of stock for each $2 that they had paid with no deductions for so-called \"return of capital.\" See supra, p. 599.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Following this hearing, the plan was then modified to provide that respondent's officers and directors would receive one share of Capitol stock for each $5.50, instead of each $3.50, of their claims, with this stock having limited voting, dividend and liquidation rights for five years, and that the banks would be treated in the same manner as respondent's other general creditors.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Where the debtor's liabilities are less than the minimal sum of $250,000, a situation clearly not present here, Chapter X permits, but does not require, the court to appoint a trustee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Originally Chapter XI, as well as Chapter X, required that the plan be \"fair and equitable.\" That requirement of Chapter XI was changed to the one stated in the text in 1952. See infra, p. 611.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This could only occur when the Chapter XI proceeding had been filed by a debtor already in straight bankruptcy proceedings. See 321; 8 Collier, Bankruptcy, 587-588 (1964 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This, of course, also answers respondent's argument that Congress, by deleting the \"fair and equitable\" requirement from Chapter XI, has somehow overturned the holding and principles of United States Realty. See also infra, p. 614.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] This, of course, does not mean that Chapter X's greater protection for public investor creditors in this regard, as well as protections of greater judicial control, a disinterested trustee, and full statutory SEC participation, is irrelevant in determining whether, as a general rule, Chapter X or Chapter XI would better serve the \"public and private interests involved,\" cf. General Stores, supra, at 466. See infra, p. 614.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] While sometimes expressing different rationales for their conclusions it is clear that the courts of appeals have recognized the general rule stated above. See SEC v. Canandaigua Enterprises Corp., supra; SEC v. Crumpton Builders, Inc., 337 F.2d 907 (C. A. 5th Cir.); SEC v. Liberty Baking Corp., 240 F.2d 511 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Mecca Temple v.

Chapter X explicitly requires that a petition brought under it must be dismissed if it has not been brought in \"good faith.\" 141. \"Good faith\" is defined so as to exclude from Chapter X those cases, inter alia, where \"it is unreasonable to expect that a plan of reorganization can be effected.\" 146 (3). Such a situation would exist where the debtor is so hopelessly insolvent that straight bankruptcy liquidation is the only available expedient. Fidelity Assurance Assn. v. Sims, supra; Goodman v. Michael, 280 F.2d 106, 108 (C. A. 1st Cir.); 6 Collier, Bankruptcy, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 594, 619]\n\u00a0\n \u00a7 6.09 (1964). Chapter XI has a provision that a plan cannot be confirmed unless it is \"for the best interests of the creditors and is feasible.\" 366 (2). This provision has been construed to preclude confirmation of a plan of arrangement where the plan would pay the creditors substantially less than they might reasonably expect to realize in liquidation. See In re Bruce Hunt Corp., 163 F. Supp. 939 (D.C. N. D. N. Y.); 9 Collier, Bankruptcy, \u00a7 9.17 (1964).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Respondent relies on language wherein, after pointing out that it \"was the view of two lower courts\" that the debtor there \"may well need a more thoroughgoing capital readjustment than is possible under c. XI,\" \n350 \nU.S., at 468\n, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS stated, for the Court: \"We could reverse them only if their exercise of discretion transcended the allowable bounds. We cannot say that it does. Rather we think that the lower courts took a fair reading of c. X and the functions it serves and reasonably concluded that this business needed a more pervasive reorganization than is available under c. XI.\" Ibid. It is clear in the context of that case that the discretionary issue there referred to was not discretion to determine the rules governing the issue of whether Chapter X or Chapter XI is appropriate, or whether these rules should be applied in all cases, but rather merely the factual question of whether or not that particular debtor needed a more pervasive reorganization than a simple composition under Chapter XI.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Respondent's further argument that Chapter XI still is appropriate since the plan, despite its clear terms, does not adversely affect the trailer owners because each of them can remove his trailer at will is also without merit. First, as noted above, Chapter X would be required here even if there were no investor-creditors. Second, the argument that the plan is voluntary ignores the fact that the investors were not purchasing trailers but were investing in the corporation. Finally, some trailers were never manufactured, others are missing, and the remainder are scattered at gasoline stations throughout the western part of the United States. It cannot seriously be contended that this right to find a trailer that was not intended to be purchased makes the plan a completely voluntary one.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] In so holding, we indicate no opinion as to whether or not a Chapter X reorganization would be appropriate in this case. See note 17, supra. We merely hold that all issues relevant to the possible financial rehabilitation of respondent must here be determined within the confines of a Chapter X, rather than a Chapter XI, proceeding.

After the third request, all but petitioner, who had been questioning the policeman about his order, had begun to walk away and the policeman arrested petitioner. Petitioner was tried before a court without a jury which, without any fact findings or opinion, convicted him of violating two ordinances, 1142 and 1231, of Birmingham's city code. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed. Because of their breadth if read literally, these ordinances present grave constitutional problems. In other decisions subsequent to petitioner's conviction, 1142 was construed by the Alabama Court of Appeals as applicable only to standing, loitering or walking on a street or sidewalk so as to obstruct free passage and refusing to obey an officer's request to move on, and 1231 was confined to the enforcement of the orders of a traffic officer while directing vehicular traffic. Held:\n\n 1. The conviction under 1142 must be set aside in view of the possibility that it was based upon an unconstitutional construction of the ordinance. Pp. 90-92.\n\n\n 2. Since petitioner, when directed to move on, was a pedestrian not around a vehicle and the arresting policeman was not directing traffic, the conviction under 1231 must fall for lack of any evidence to support the alleged violation.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, upon a complaint charging him with violating two sections of the General Code of the City of Birmingham, Alabama.\n1\n After trial without a jury, the court found him \"guilty as charged in the Complaint,\" and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 180 days at hard labor and an additional 61 days at hard labor in default of a $100 fine and costs.

We granted certiorari to consider the petitioner's claim that under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution his conviction cannot stand. \n380 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\nThe two ordinances which Shuttlesworth was charged with violating are 1142 and 1231 of the Birmingham General City Code. The relevant paragraph of 1142 provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any person or any number of persons to so stand, loiter or walk upon any street or sidewalk in the city as to obstruct free passage over, on or along said street or sidewalk. It shall also be unlawful for any person to stand or loiter upon any street or sidewalk of the city after having been requested by any police officer to move on.\" Section 1231 provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse or fail to comply with any lawful order, signal or direction of a police officer.\" The two counts in the complaint were framed in the words of these ordinances.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe evidence was in conflict, but the prosecution's version of the facts can be briefly summarized. On April 4, 1962, at about 10:30 a. m., Patrolman Byars of the Birmingham Police Department observed Shuttlesworth standing on a sidewalk with 10 or 12 companions outside a department store near the intersection of 2d Ave. and 19th St. in the City of Birmingham. After observing the group for a minute or so, Byars walked up and \"told them they would have to move on and clear the sidewalk and not obstruct it for the pedestrians.\" After some, but not all, of the group began to disperse, Byars repeated this request twice. In response to the second request, Shuttlesworth said, \"You mean to say we can't stand here on the sidewalk?\" After the third request he replied, \"Do you mean to tell me we can't stand here in front of this store?\" By this time everybody in the group but Shuttlesworth had begun to walk away, and Patrolman Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then responded, \"Well, I will go into the store,\" \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n and walked into the entrance of the adjacent department store. Byars followed and took him into custody just inside the store's entrance.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nOn its face, the here relevant paragraph of 1142 sets out two separate and disjunctive offenses. The paragraph makes it an offense to \"so stand, loiter or walk upon any street or sidewalk . . . as to obstruct free passage over, on or along said street or sidewalk.\" The paragraph makes it \"also . . . unlawful for any person to stand or loiter upon any street or sidewalk . . . after having been requested by any police officer to move on.\" (Emphasis added.) The first count of the complaint in this case, tracking the ordinance, charged these two separate offenses in the alternative.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nLiterally read, therefore, the second part of this ordinance says that a person may stand on a public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration.\n5\n It \"does not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat.\" Cox v. Louisiana, \n379 \nU.S. 536, 579\n (separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK). Instinct with \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n its ever-present potential for arbitrarily suppressing First Amendment liberties, that kind of law bears the hallmark of a police state.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe matter is not one which need be exhaustively pursued, however, because, as the respondent correctly points out, the Alabama Court of Appeals has not read 1142 literally, but has given to it an explicitly narrowed construction. The ordinance, that court has ruled, \"is directed at obstructing the free passage over, on or along a street or sidewalk by the manner in which a person accused stands, loiter or walks thereupon. Our decisions make it clear that the mere refusal to move on after a police officer's requesting that a person standing or loitering should do so is not enough to support the offense. . . . [T]here must also be a showing of the accused's blocking free passage . . . .\" Middlebrooks v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala. App. 525. 527, 170 So.2d 424, 426.\n\nThe Alabama Court of Appeals has thus authoritatively ruled that 1142 applies only when a person who stands, loiters, or walks on a street or sidewalk so as to obstruct free passage refuses to obey a request by an officer to move on. It is our duty, of course, to accept this state judicial construction of the ordinance. Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507\n; United States v. Burnison, \n339 \nU.S. 87\n; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Board of Railroad Comm'rs, \n332 \nU.S. 495\n. As so construed, we cannot say that the ordinance is unconstitutional, though it requires no great feat of imagination to envisage situations in which such an ordinance might be unconstitutionally applied.\n\nThe present limiting construction of 1142 was not given to the ordinance by the Alabama Court of Appeals, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n however, until its decision in Middlebrooks, supra, two years after the petitioner's conviction in the present case.\n7\n In Middlebrooks the Court of Appeals stated that it had applied its narrowed construction of the ordinance in affirming Shuttlesworth's conviction, but its opinion in the present case, 42 Ala. App. 296, 161 So.2d 796, nowhere makes explicit any such construction. In any event, the trial court in the present case was without guidance from any state appellate court as to the meaning of the ordinance.\n\nThe trial court made no findings of fact and rendered no opinion. For all that appears, that court may have found the petitioner guilty only by applying the literal - and unconstitutional - terms of the ordinance. Upon the evidence before him, the trial judge as finder of the facts might easily have determined that the petitioner had created an obstruction, but had subsequently moved on. The court might alternatively have found that the petitioner himself had created no obstruction, but had simply disobeyed Patrolman Byars' instruction to move on. In either circumstance the literal terms of the ordinance would apply; in neither circumstance would the ordinance be applicable as now construed by the Alabama Court of Appeals. Because we are unable to say that the Alabama courts in this case did not judge the petitioner by an unconstitutional construction of the ordinance, the petitioner's conviction under 1142 cannot stand. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe find the petitioner's conviction under the second count of the complaint, for violation of 1231 of the General City Code, to be constitutionally invalid for a completely distinct reason. That ordinance makes it a criminal offense for any person \"to refuse or fail to comply with any lawful order, signal or direction of a police officer.\" Like the provisions of 1142 discussed above, the literal terms of this ordinance are so broad as to evoke constitutional doubts of the utmost gravity. But the Alabama Court of Appeals has confined this ordinance to a relatively narrow scope. In reversing the conviction of the petitioner's codefendant, the court said of 1231: \"This section appears in the chapter regulating vehicular traffic, and provides for the enforcement of the orders of the officers of the police department in directing such traffic.\" Phifer v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala. App. 282, 285, 160 So.2d 898, 901.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe record contains no evidence whatever that Patrolman Byars was directing vehicular traffic at the time he told the petitioner and his companions to move on. Whatever Patrolman Byars' other generally assigned duties may have been,\n9\n he testified unambiguously that \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n he directed the petitioner's group to move on, to \"clear the sidewalk and not obstruct it for the pedestrians.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nFive years ago this Court decided the case of Thompson v. City of Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n. There we reversed the conviction of a man who had been found guilty in the police court of Louisville, Kentucky, of loitering and disorderly conduct. The proposition for which that case stands is simple and clear. It has nothing to do with concepts relating to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence in any particular case. It goes, rather, to the most basic concepts of due process of law. Its application in Thompson's case turned, as MR. JUSTICE \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n BLACK pointed out, \"not on the sufficiency of the evidence, but on whether this conviction rests upon any evidence at all.\" \n362 \nU.S., at 199\n. The Court found there was \"no evidence whatever in the record to support these convictions,\" and held that it was \"a violation of due process to convict and punish a man without evidence of his guilt.\" \n362 \nU.S., at 206\n. See also Garner v. Louisiana, \n368 \nU.S. 157\n.\n\nNo more need be said in this case with respect to the petitioner's conviction for violating 1231 of the General Code of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. Quite simply, the petitioner was not in, on, or around any vehicle at the time he was directed to move on or at the time he was arrested. He was a pedestrian. Officer Byars did not issue any direction to the petitioner in the course of directing vehicular traffic, because Officer Byars was not then directing any such traffic. There was thus no evidence whatever in the record to support the petitioner's conviction under this ordinance as it has been authoritatively construed by the Alabama Court of Appeals. It was a violation of due process to convict and punish him without evidence of his guilt.\n\nFor these reasons the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals of Alabama for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This was a trial de novo on appeal from a judgment of conviction in the Recorder's Court of the City of Birmingham.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n]    \"Count One\n\n\"Comes the City of Birmingham, Alabama, a municipal corporation, and complains that F. L. Shuttlesworth, within twelve months \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n before the beginning of this prosecution and within the City of Birmingham, or the police jurisdiction thereof, did stand, loiter or walk upon a street or sidewalk within and among a group of other persons so as to obstruct free passage over, on or along said street or sidewalk at, to-wit: 2nd Avenue, North, at 19th Street or did while in said group stand or loiter upon said street or sidewalk after having been requested by a police officer to move on, contrary to and in violation of Section 1142 of the General City Code of Birmingham of 1944, as amended by Ordinance Number 1436-F.\n\n    \"Count Two\n\n\n\n\"Comes the City of Birmingham, Alabama, a municipal corporation, and complains that F.

There was no showing, however, of any connection between this campaign and the presence of the petitioner and his companions outside the department store on the morning of his arrest.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Thornhill v.

City of Birmingham, 42 Ala. App. 371, 165 So.2d 912, affirming the conviction of a defendant who refused to obey an officer's direction to get out of the middle of a street which had been closed to private vehicles and in which \"[p]olice cars and fire engines were being used to move and quiet the crowd.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Patrolman Byars testified that on the morning in question he was a \"utility officer,\" and that as such he was \"in charge of the direction and movement of all traffic at 3rd Avenue and 19th Street and four blocks in an east, west, north and south direction.\" He conceded that he was \"not regularly placed\" at the intersection where the arrest occurred, and that he had \"nothing to do with the other officers who were also there.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The record shows that the officer directing vehicular traffic at the intersection of 2d Ave. and 19th St. at the time of the petitioner's arrest was Officer Hallman. His relevant testimony was as follows:\n\n\"Q. Now, you observe on these corners from your position here when you police that corner, do you not?\n\n\n\"A. I try to.\n\n\n\"Q. Had you seen these people over there blocking traffic before you saw Officer Byars?\n\n\n\"A. I saw him standing over there talking to them.\n\n\n\"Q. Did you see them before he was talking to them?\n\n\n\"A. I saw them over there. I didn't pay any particular attention to them.\n\n\n\"Q. Did you get the impression they were waiting for the light to change?\n\n\n\"A. I couldn't answer that because I don't know what they had on their mind.\n\n\n\"Q. You formed no impression when you first saw them?\n\n\n\"A. No.\n\n\n\"Q. You took no note of them when you first saw them, is that right?\n\n\n\"A. Just saw them standing over there.\n\n\n\"Q. The only time you made note of them standing over there was when you saw the policeman assisting you talking to them?\n\n\n\"A. When I saw him over there talking to them. He wasn't assisting me.\n\n\n\"Q. He wasn't assisting you with your corner.\n\n\n\"A. No.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nI join Part II of the Court's opinion but would reverse on Count I for a somewhat different reason. The police power of a municipality is certainly ample to deal with all traffic conditions on the streets - pedestrian as well as vehicular. So there could be no doubt that if petitioner were one member of a group obstructing a sidewalk he could, pursuant to a narrowly drawn ordinance, be asked to move on and, if he refused, be arrested for the obstruction. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n But in this case the testimony is that the group dissolved when warned by the police, save only the petitioner.\n*\n At the time of the arrest petitioner was no longer blocking traffic. Section 1142 of the Birmingham General Code makes it unlawful to \"obstruct the free passage of persons on . . . sidewalks.\" The ordinance, as it has been construed by the Alabama Court of Appeals, has been held to apply only to one who continues to block a sidewalk after a police warning to move. Middlebrooks v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala. App. 525, 527, 170 So.2d 424, 426. There was no such \"obstructing\" here, unless petitioner's presence on the street was itself enough. Failure to obey such an order, when one is not acting unlawfully, certainly cannot be made a crime in a country where freedom of locomotion (Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160\n) is honored. For these reasons I think there was no evidence, within the meaning of Thompson v. City of Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n, to sustain the conviction and hence I would reverse the judgment outright.\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE\n\nDOUGLAS.\n\n\n\n\n Officer Robert L. Byars, who made the arrest, testified on cross-examination as follows:\n\n\"Q. How many persons were standing there at that intersection when you first observed it?\n\n\n\"A. Some ten or twelve.\n\n\n\"Q. Were they all colored or white people, or altogether or what?\n\n\n\"A. I didn't pay particular notice to the race.\n\n\n\"Q. You stood there a minute or minute and a half and then you went out and cleared the intersection?\n\n\n\"A. I went out and asked them to move. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Q. Was that great big crowd out there and the intersection completely blocked? You testified you had half of the south-north cross walk free, that the defendants were not blocking half of the south-north cross walk, they were standing in the west part of the cross walk where they should be standing assuming they were going south, they were not blocking the east-west cross walk at all? Now, where was the crowd that was blocking?\n\n\n\"A. They were all standing on the sidewalk.\n\n\n\"Q. You mean the crowd?\n\n\n\"A. That's right, including the defendant.\n\n\n\"Q. Now, you placed the defendants where you have the X. Now, the crowd is what we are interested in now, the crowd they were blocking, where were they?\n\n\n\"Mr. Walker: We object. There has been no testimony that there was a crowd that was being blocked; the testimony is there was a crowd blocking the moving traffic.\n\n\n\"Q. Are these defendants charged then with assembling the crowd or something? Who were they blocking? Where were the persons they were blocking, these two defendants here?\n\n\n\"A. They were blocking half of the sidewalk causing the people walking east to go into the street around them.\n\n\n\"Q. The people walking east along what street?\n\n\n\"A. Along 2nd Avenue.\n\n\n\"Q. Along this way (indicating)?\n\n\n\"A. That's right.\n\n\n\"Q. The people walking along 2nd Avenue from west to east had to go around them?\n\n\n\"A. That is true.\n\n\n\"Q. While they stood there?\n\n\n\"A. That is true.\n\n\n\"Q. And you observed that for a minute or minute and a half? \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 98]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"A. That is true.\n\n\n\"Q. And then you went out and you required them to move on. Did you speak directly to the Defendant Shuttlesworth?\n\n\n\"A. I spoke to the people standing assembled there.\n\n\n\"Q. They all moved but him, is that correct?\n\n\n\"A. Not on the first request they didn't all move. Some began to move.\n\n\n\"Q. Well, all had moved by the time you made the arrest?\n\n\n\"A. Except Shuttlesworth.\n\n\n\"Q. Nobody was standing there but Shuttlesworth?\n\n\n\"A. Nobody was standing; everybody else was in motion except the Defendant Shuttlesworth, who had never moved.\n\n\n\"Q. Was he talking to you during this time?\n\n\n\"A. He made a statement to me on two occasions when I informed him to move on on three occasions.\n\n\n\"Q. Did he ask you where you wanted him to move?\n\n\n\"A. No.\n\n\n\"Q. Did you tell him where to move?\n\n\n\"A. I did not.\n\n\n\"Q. You didn't arrest anybody but Shuttlesworth?\n\n\n\"A. Not at that time.\" (R. 27-28.)\n\n\n Officer C. W. Hallman, who observed the above after having been called over by Officer Byars, testified on direct examination as follows:\n\n\"Q. About how many was in the group at that time, if you know?\n\n\n\"A. I would say five or six. It could have been more or less.\n\n\n\"Q. What happened to the group then, if anything?\n\n\n\"A. All of them dispersed except Shuttlesworth.\n\n\n\"Q. What happened after that?\n\n\n\"A. Officer Byars told him he was under arrest for blocking the sidewalk and placed him under arrest.\" (R. 59-60.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Appendix hereto. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.\n\nI join the Court's opinion on my understanding that Middlebrooks v. City of Birmingham is being read as holding that 1142 applies only when a person (a) stands, loiters or walks on a street or sidewalk so as to obstruct free passage, (b) is requested by an officer to move on, and (c) thereafter continues to block passage by loitering or standing on the street. It is only this limiting construction which saves the statute from the constitutional challenge that it is overly broad. Moreover, because this construction delimits the statute to \"the sort of `hard-core' conduct that would obviously be prohibited under any construction,\" Dombrowski v. Pfister, \n380 \nU.S. 479, 491\n-492, it may be legitimately applied to such conduct occurring before that construction.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FORTAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\nI agree that Shuttlesworth's conviction must be set aside. But I am concerned lest the opinion of the Court be considered as indicating that Shuttlesworth can constitutionally be convicted of violating the General Code of the City of Birmingham, Alabama, on the facts here presented. Any such conviction would violate basic constitutional guaranties. I would make this clear now.\n\nThe Court's opinion does not challenge the constitutionality of 1142 of the Birmingham Code as that section was construed by the Alabama Court of Appeals two years after Shuttlesworth's conviction. The opinion may be read to imply that if Shuttlesworth is now put to trial for violation of 1142, as construed, the vice of the present conviction may be eliminated. I would make it clear that the Federal Constitution forbids a conviction on the facts of this record, regardless of the validity of the ordinance involved. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI agree that, as construed by Alabama two years after Shuttlesworth was convicted, 1142 cannot be held unconstitutional on its face. I agree that if there were a rational basis for charging Shuttlesworth with violating the section as so construed, he could be retried if Alabama should choose so vigorously to protect the sidewalks of Birmingham. Civil rights leaders, like all other persons, are subject to the law and must comply with it. Their calling carries no immunity. Their cause confers no privilege to break or disregard the law.\n\nBut there is here no possible basis for a conviction which would be valid under the Federal Constitution. The accused provision would be unconstitutional as applied to Shuttlesworth's facts even after the plastic surgery by Alabama's Court of Appeals in 1964. Middlebrooks v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala. App. 525, 170 So.2d 424.\n1\n A revision of the formula does not and cannot change the facts; and those facts do not permit the State to jail Shuttlesworth for his actions on April 4, 1962.\n\nTaking the prosecution's version of the facts, it appears that Shuttlesworth was one of a group of 8, 10 or 12\n2\n persons who at 10:30 a.m. on April 4, 1962, were accosted by a patrolman after they had stood for a minute or a minute and a half at 19th Street and 2nd Avenue in Birmingham. They occupied one-half of the sidewalk. They were conversing among themselves. There is no suggestion of disorder or of deliberate obstruction of pedestrian traffic. After the first command by the patrolman, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 101]\n\u00a0\n the group commenced to move away. The officer repeated his command, and Shuttlesworth said, \"You mean to say we can't stand here on the sidewalk?\" After the third command, Shuttlesworth said, \"Do you mean to tell me we can't stand here in front of this store?\" The officer then told Shuttlesworth he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth said he would go into the store. The officer followed and arrested him. There was no resistance. By this time everybody in the group except Shuttlesworth had moved away. The entire incident took less than four and one-half minutes, from arrival of Shuttlesworth and his friends at the corner to his arrest.\n\nFor this, Shuttlesworth was tried, convicted and sentenced to spend half a year at hard labor and to pay a fine of $100.\n\nIn my view, there is nothing in the facts which justified an arrest and conviction. Prior to the officer's command the situation was that a small group of people occupying one-half of the sidewalk were engaged in orderly conversation. Promptly upon the officer's command, the group began to disperse and only Shuttlesworth remained. He, alone, cannot be held to have blocked the sidewalk. His rhetorical questions may have irritated the patrolman; but a policeman's lot is not a happy one - and certainly, in context, Shuttlesworth's questions did not rise to the magnitude of an offense against the laws of Alabama. If one were to confine oneself to the surface version of the facts, a general alarm for the people of Birmingham would be in order. Their use of the sidewalks would be hazardous beyond measure.\n\nBut this, of course, is fiction. It is facade for a narrower, but no less disagreeable, truth. On April 4, 1962, the Negroes of Birmingham were engaged in a \"selective buying campaign\" - an attempted boycott - of Birmingham's stores for the purpose of protesting discrimination against them. Shuttlesworth and his companions were \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 102]\n\u00a0\n Negroes.\n3\n They were standing in front of a department store. Shuttlesworth, as an officer who participated in the arrest testified, was a \"notorious\" person in the field of civil rights in Birmingham.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn my view the net effect of the facts in this case is inescapable. Shuttlesworth's arrest was an incident in the tense racial conflict in Birmingham. This may explain the arrest, but it adds nothing to its lawfulness. There is no basis in the facts and circumstances of the case for charging that Shuttlesworth was \"blocking free passage\" on the sidewalk, Middlebrooks, supra, at 527, 170 So.2d, at 426, or that he culpably refused to obey an order of an officer to move on, or remained after such an order so as to justify arrest, trial or conviction. Any attempt to punish Shuttlesworth in these circumstances would, in my view, violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As the Court's opinion herein points out, in Middlebrooks, the Court of Appeals stated that its narrowed construction of the ordinance had been the \"ratio decidendi\" of Shuttlesworth, decided a year earlier. But there is no indication of this in Shuttlesworth itself.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Officer Renshaw testified there were 8, 10 or 12 people in the group (R. 40). Officer Byars testified to 10 or 12 (R. 17).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Testimony of Officer Renshaw (R. 49). Officer Byars testified that he didn't know what color they were (R. 27, 36).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The principal arresting officer testified that he did not recognize Shuttlesworth, but he had seen his picture on television. He had heard of him, had read that he had frequently been arrested, and that he had been in the Birmingham jail. Shuttlesworth's walk on April 4, 1962, started during a recess in a federal court civil rights trial in which he was involved. The trial had been publicized. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 87, 103]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIMMONS v. UNION NEWS CO.(1965)\nNo. 224\nArgued: Decided: October 18, 1965\n\n\n  Dee Edwards, for petitioner.   Frederic S. Glover, Jr., for respondent.\n  Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.   Denied.\n\n Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice BLACK with whom the Chief Justice concurs:\n'I would grant certiorari in this case. While petitioner presents other interesting and important questions concerning the right of trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment and concerning the power of a district court to grant summary judgment, my opinion is addressed to the question of whether the courts below were right in denying petitioner Simmons a court trial of her claim that she had been wrongfully discharged without 'just cause' in violation of the collective bargaining agreement under which she was employed. The ground for refusing to let her try her case was that her employer and her union had agreed among themselves that her discharge was for 'just cause.' I think the courts below were wrong. The material facts upon which I base my conclusion are these:\n\n'Petitioner was one of about a dozen employees working at the lunch counter in respondent's restaurant in a railway station. For about a year prior to petitioner's discharge, profits at the lunch counter lagged behind those expected by respondent. Respondent suspected that this was due either to the mishandling or to the actual stealing of its funds or goods. The collective bargaining agreement provided that no employee should be discharged without 'just cause' and that prospective discharges would be discussed by the employer and the union. Pursuant to the contract, the company's representative went to the union's representative to discuss what could be done in order to improve the profit situation at the lunch counter. The company representative suggested that all of the counter employees be discharged and other take \n\n[382 \nU.S. 884\n, 885]\n\u00a0\n their places. The union representative objected. After lengthy negotiations, however, a plan was agreed upon by the company and the union under which five of the employees would be immediately laid off for a two- week period. If at the end of the period, records indicated that there was a significant improvement in the company's business at the lunch counter, it was agreed that the five employees were to be discharged. The five were laid off including the petitioner and Gladys Hildreth. \n1\n When the company convinced the union that the lunch counter profits had increased during the period, the union agreed with respondent that the workers should be discharged permanently. Both petitioner and Miss Hildreth vigorously protested. They urged the union to carry their protest all the way up through the various stages of negotiations leading to arbitration. The union representative, however, refused to give any help to petitioner and Miss Hildreth. Then, petitioner, by herself, took the matter up with the company, endeavoring to settle it as a personal grievance of her own. The company refused to negotiate with petitioner in any way whatever, notwithstanding  9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act2 which states in part, 'That any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement then in effect.' Petitioner, out of a job, then brought this action against the company for the alleged breach of contract in discharging her.' \n\n[382 \nU.S. 884\n, 886]\n\u00a0\n  'Although this Court has gone very far in some of its cases with reference to the power of a collective bargaining union to process the personal grievances of its members, it has not yet gone so far as to say that where there is a personal grievance for breach of a collective bargaining agreement, the employee can be deprived of an independent judicial determination of the claim by an agreement between the union and the employer that no breach exists. But this is exactly what was done to petitioner and Miss Hildreth. Though I dissented in Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, \n379 \nU.S. 650\n, I was, and still am of the belief that the majority opinion purported to preserve the right of an employee to sue his employer if his union refused to press his grievances. However, I fear that the decisions below in the Hildreth case and in this one go a long way toward effectively destroying whatever redress this Court left the individual employee in Maddox. The courts below refused to make their own determination of whether Miss Hildreth's and petitioner's discharges were made for 'just cause.' Instead they allowed the employer's defense that 'just cause' was simply what the employer and the union jointly wanted it to be. While we often say that nothing is decided by a denial of certiorari, all of us know that a denial of certiorari in this case, following the denial of certiorari in the Hildreth case, will undoubtedly lead people to believe, and I fear with cause, that this Court is now approving such a forfeiture of contractual claims of individual employees.\n\n'This case points up with great emphasis the kind of injustice that can occur to an individual employee when the employer and the union have such power over the employee's claim for breach of contract. Here no one has claimed from the beginning to the end of the Hildreth lawsuit or this lawsuit that either of these individuals was guilty of any kind of misconduct justifying their discharges. Each was one of twelve employees engaged in \n\n[382 \nU.S. 884\n, 887]\n\u00a0\n the operation of a lunch counter. In the Hildreth case respondent's supervisor testified that he had no knowledge that any of the employees discharged were in any way responsible for the lunch counter's unsuccessful operation. The manager of the lunch counter stated that he did not know of 'one single thing' that Miss Hildreth had done to reduce the counter's profits. We must assume that had petitioner here been given an opportunity to try her case, the same facts would have appeared. Moreover, petitioner alleges that she was prepared to show that subsequent to her discharge, the office girl who counted the money received at the lunch counter was found to be embezzling those funds and was discharged for it. Miss Hildreth had worked for respondent for nine and one-half years, and petitioner for fifteen years, prior to their discharges. There is no evidence that respondent had ever been dissatisfied with their work before the company became disappointed with its lunch counter about a year prior to the discharges. Yet both were discharged for 'just cause,' as determined not by a court but by an agreement of the company and the union.\n\n'I would not construe the National Labor Relations Act as giving a union and an employer any such power over workers. In this case there has been no bargain made on behalf of all the workers represented by the union. Rather there has been a sacrifice of the rights of a group of employees based on the belief that some of them might possibly have been guilty of some kind of misconduct that would reduce the employer's profits. Fully recognizing the right of the collective bargaining representative to make a contract on the part of the workers for the future, I cannot believe that those who passed the Act intended to give the union the right to negotiate away alleged breaches of a contract claimed by individual employees.\n\n'The plain fact is that petitioner has lost her job, not because of any guilt on her part, but because there is a \n\n[382 \nU.S. 884\n, 888]\n\u00a0\n suspicion that some one of the group which was discharged was guilty of misconduct. The sum total of what has been done here is to abandon the fine, old American ideal that guilt is personal. Our system of jurisprudence should not tolerate imposing on the innocent, punishment that should be laid on the guilty. If the construction of the labor law given by the courts below is to stand, it should be clearly and unequivocally announced by this Court so that Congress can, if it sees fit, consider this question and protect the just claims of employees from the joint power of employers and unions.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Union News Company v.

MIAMI BEACH NAT. BANK(1965)\nNo. 363\nArgued: March 10, 1965Decided: May 3, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner and her husband, Simons, were legally separated in New York, where they were domiciled, and he was ordered by the separation decree to make monthly alimony payments. He ultimately moved to Florida, where a year later he secured a divorce. Petitioner had valid constructive notice of the divorce action but entered no appearance. Simons made the monthly payments under the New York decree up to his death about eight years after the divorce. Petitioner claimed dower under Florida law when respondent, executor, offered Simons' will for probate. Respondent opposed the claim on the ground that because of the divorce petitioner was not Simons' wife when he died. Petitioner then brought this action in a Florida court seeking a declaration that the divorce had not destroyed her dower claim. The trial court's dismissal of the action was affirmed on appeal and the state supreme court declined review. Held:\n\n 1. The denial of petitioner's dower by the Florida courts did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution, since the New York decree, which was fully complied with by Simons, preserved no dower rights in his property. P. 84.\n\n\n 2. Any dower rights petitioner may have had in Simons' estate under Florida law did not survive the divorce decree, since under Florida law dower rights in Florida property are inchoate, and are extinguished by a divorce decree predicated upon constructive service. P. 85.\n\n\n 157 So.2d 199, affirmed.\n\nRobert C. Ward argued the cause for petitioner. On the brief was William Gresham Ward.\n\nMarion E. Sibley argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Irving B. Levenson. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question to be decided in this case is whether a husband's valid Florida divorce, obtained in a proceeding wherein his nonresident wife was served by publication only and did not make a personal appearance, unconstitutionally extinguished her dower right in his Florida estate.\n\nThe petitioner and Sol Simons were domiciled in New York when, in 1946, she obtained a New York separation decree that included an award of monthly alimony. Sol Simons moved to Florida in 1951 and, a year later, obtained there a divorce in an action of which petitioner had valid constructive notice but in which she did not enter a personal appearance.\n1\n After Sol Simons' death in Florida in 1960, respondent, the executor of his estate, offered his will for probate in the Probate Court of Dade County, Florida. Petitioner appeared in the proceeding and filed an election to take dower under Florida law, rather than have her rights in the estate governed by the terms of the will, which made no provision for her.\n2\n The respondent opposed the dower claim, asserting that since Sol Simons \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 83]\n\u00a0\n had divorced petitioner she had not been his wife at his death, and consequently was not entitled to dower under Florida law. Petitioner thereupon brought the instant action in the Circuit Court for Dade County in order to set aside the divorce decree and to obtain a declaration that the divorce, even if valid to alter her marital status, did not destroy or impair her claim to dower. The action was dismissed after trial, and the Florida District Court of Appeal for the Third District affirmed. 157 So.2d 199.\n3\n The Supreme Court of Florida declined to review the case, 166 So.2d 151. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 877\n. We affirm.\n\nPetitioner's counsel advised us during oral argument that he no longer challenged the judgment below insofar as it embodied a holding that the 1952 Florida divorce was valid and terminated the marital status of the parties. We therefore proceed to the decision of the question whether the Florida courts unconstitutionally denied petitioner's dower claim.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner argues that since she had not appeared in the Florida divorce action the Florida divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had acquired under the New York decree. She invokes the principle of Estin v. Estin, \n334 \nU.S. 541\n, where this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband's obligation to provide the wife support as required by a pre-existing New York separation decree. As this was so, we there ruled that New York, in giving continued effect to the maintenance provisions of its separation decree, did not deny full faith and credit to the Nevada decree. See U.S. Const., Art. IV, 1.\n5\n The application of the Estin principle to the instant case, petitioner contends, dictates that we hold the Florida courts to their constitutional duty to give effect to the New York decree, inherent in which is a preservation of her dower right.\n\nThe short answer to this contention is that the only obligation imposed on Sol Simons by the New York decree, and the only rights granted petitioner under it, concerned monthly alimony for petitioner's support. Unlike the ex-husband in Estin, Sol Simons made the support payments called for by the separate maintenance decree notwithstanding his ex parte divorce. In making these payments until his death he complied with the full measure of the New York decree; when he died there was consequently nothing left of the New York decree for Florida to dishonor.\n\nThis conclusion embodies our judgment that there is nothing in the New York decree itself that can be construed as creating or preserving any interest in the nature \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n of or in lieu of dower in any property of the decedent, wherever located. Petitioner refers us to no New York law that treats such a decree as having that effect, or, for that matter, to any New York law that has such an effect irrespective of the existence of the decree. We think it clear that the burden of showing this rested upon petitioner. Cf. State Farm Ins. Co. v. Duel, \n324 \nU.S. 154, 160\n; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n-548. It follows that insofar as petitioner's argument rests on rights created by the New York decree or by New York law, the denial of her dower by the Florida courts was not a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Cf. Armstrong v. Armstrong, \n350 \nU.S. 568\n.\n\nInsofar as petitioner argues that since she was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Florida divorce court its decree could not extinguish any dower right existing under Florida law, Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt, \n354 \nU.S. 416, 418\n, the answer is that under Florida law no dower right survived the decree. The Supreme Court of Florida has said that dower rights in Florida property, being inchoate, are extinguished by a divorce decree predicated upon substituted or constructive service. Pawley v. Pawley, 46 So.2d 464.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt follows that the Florida courts transgressed no constitutional bounds in denying petitioner dower in her ex-husband's Florida estate.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was served by publication while still living in New York and received copies of the order for publication and the divorce complaint. She did not enter an appearance in the Florida proceeding on advice of counsel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 21 Fla. Stat. Ann. 1964, 731.34 provides as follows:\n\n\"Whenever the widow of any decedent shall not be satisfied with the portion of the estate of her husband to which she is entitled under the law of descent and distribution or under the will of her husband, or both, she may elect in the manner provided by law to take dower, which dower shall be one third in fee simple of the real property which was owned by her husband at the time of his death or which he had before conveyed, whereof she had not relinquished her right of dower as provided by law, and one third part absolutely of the personal property owned by her husband at the time of his death . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner attacked the validity of the divorce on the grounds: (1) that Sol Simons had defrauded the Florida courts by falsely claiming residence, (2) that the New York decree was a bar to the divorce suit and that Sol Simons had defrauded the court by failing to disclose the prior New York decree, (3) that the divorce decree on its face showed want of jurisdiction and (4) that after petitioner received notice of the divorce suit Sol Simons lulled her into inaction. The trial court made findings of fact adverse to petitioner on all points and dismissed the suit with prejudice. In affirming, the Florida District Court of Appeal held that \"[t]he prior New York separate maintenance decree was not a bar to a divorce suit by the husband, and his failure to disclose it in his complaint was not a fraud on the court . . . . Any affirmative defense the prior suit may have afforded should have been presented in the divorce suit.\" 157 So.2d 199, at 200.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Neither the Florida trial court nor the District Court of Appeal expressly discussed the merits of petitioner's claim that the divorce, even if valid, did not destroy or impair her dower rights. But since Florida law allows dower only to a decedent's wife, see note 6, infra, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n we interpret the Florida courts' decisions sustaining the validity of the divorce as also holding that the divorce extinguished petitioner's dower rights.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In Pawley the Supreme Court of Florida distinguished the dower right from the right to support, saying at 46 So.2d 464, 472-473, n. 2:\n\n\"In this, if not in every jurisdiction, right of dower can never be made the subject of a wholly independent issue in any divorce suit. It stands or falls as a result of the decree which denies or grants divorce. It arises upon marriage, as an institution of the law. The inchoate right of dower has some of the incidents of property. It partakes of the nature of a lien or encumbrance. It is not a right which is originated by or is derived from the husband; nor is it a personal obligation to be met or fulfilled by him, but it is a creature of the law, is born at the marriage altar, cradled in the bosom of the marital status as an integral and component part thereof, survives \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n during the life of the wife as such and finds its sepulcher in divorce. Alimony too is an institution of the law but it is a personal obligation of the husband which is based upon the duty imposed upon him by the common law to support his wife and gives rise to a personal right of the wife to insist upon, if she be entitled to, it. It has none of the incidents of, and is in no sense a lien upon or interest in, property. Consequently, the right of the wife to be heard on the question of alimony should not, indeed lawfully it cannot, be destroyed by a divorce decree sought and secured by the husband in an action wherein only constructive service of process was effected.\"\n\n\n A petition for writ of certiorari to this Court alleged, \"Petitioner is thus permitted to file another suit for alimony, but her contract of marriage is annulled and her inchoate dower rights destroyed without due process of law.\" Brief for petitioner, p. 9, Pawley v. Pawley, No. 325, October Term, 1950. The petition was denied, \n340 \nU.S. 866\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI am happy to join the opinion of the Court because it makes a partial retreat from Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt, \n354 \nU.S. 416\n, a decision which I believe must eventually be rerationalized, if not entirely overruled.\n\nThe Vanderbilt case was this. The Vanderbilt couple was domiciled in California. Mr. Vanderbilt went to Nevada, established a new domicile, and obtained an ex parte\n1\n divorce decree which did not provide for alimony payments to Mrs. Vanderbilt. In the meantime Mrs. Vanderbilt went to New York. After the Nevada decree had become final, she sued in New York for support under New York law, sequestering Mr. Vanderbilt's property located there. New York ordered support payments, rejecting full-faith-and-credit arguments based on \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 87]\n\u00a0\n the Nevada decree. Over dissents by Mr. Justice Frankfurter and myself (\n354 \nU.S., at 419\n, 428) the Court affirmed the New York award, holding that because the Nevada court had no personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Vanderbilt, \"the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife's right to support, was void . . . .\" \n354 \nU.S., at 419\n.\n\nTwo rules emerged from the case, neither of which, I suggest with deference, commends itself: (1) an ex parte divorce can have no effect on property rights; (2) a State in which a wife subsequently establishes domicile can award support to her regardless of her connection with that State at the time of the ex parte divorce and regardless of the law in her former State of domicile.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe first rule slips unobtrusively into oblivion in today's decision, for Florida is allowed to turn property rights on its ex parte decree. A concurrence disputes this, but I do not understand how the Court's language in this case can be read as anything less. If I may paraphrase only slightly, the Court says, \"Insofar as petitioner argues that since she was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Florida divorce court, its decree could not \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 88]\n\u00a0\n extinguish any dower right existing under Florida law, Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt, \n354 \nU.S. 416, 418\n, the answer is that the Florida decree extinguished petitioner's dower rights.\" Ante, p. 85. The Court goes on to state and accept the Florida law that an ex parte divorce extinguishes dower rights. I do not see how a withdrawal from the due process phase of Vanderbilt could be clearer.\n\nBecause New York was petitioner's State of domicile at all times relevant to this case and did not purport to invest her with any rights to property beyond those she received from her husband, the second rule is not involved here. My hope is that its time will come too. I continue to believe that the views expressed in my Vanderbilt dissent embody a more satisfactory and workable approach to the law of \"divisible divorce\" (Estin v. Estin, \n334 \nU.S. 541\n) than can be distilled from existing Court opinions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Ex parte\" throughout this opinion is used to denote a situation in which the divorce court has not obtained personal jurisdiction over the defendant spouse.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Vanderbilt result might have been proper on any of three grounds. (1) If New York was Mrs. Vanderbilt's State of domicile at the time of the ex parte Nevada divorce, New York law investing a wife with support rights should not be overborne by an ex parte decree in another State. (2) If California was Mrs. Vanderbilt's domicile at the time of the Nevada divorce and under California law support could have been awarded, New York should also be free (though not bound) to award support. (3) If Mr. Vanderbilt owned property in New York at the time of the ex parte divorce, New York might arguably be free to hold that ownership of New York property carries with it the obligation to support one's wife, at least to the extent of the value of that property.\n\nThe Court did not concern itself with the location of Mrs. Vanderbilt's domicile or Mr. Vanderbilt's property at the time of the Nevada divorce.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.\n\nI agree completely with the Court's judgment and opinion, and add these few words only in reply to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN that the Court here is making \"a partial retreat from Vanderbilt v. Vanderbilt, \n354 \nU.S. 416\n.\" I do not think that today's decision marks any \"retreat\" at all from the opinion or holding in Vanderbilt, and I do not understand the Court so to regard it. Vanderbilt held that a wife's right to support could not be cut off by an ex parte divorce. In the case before us, Mrs. Simons' Florida dower was not terminated by the ex parte divorce. It simply never came into existence. No one disputes that the ex parte divorce was effective to end the marriage, so that after it Mrs. Simons was no longer Mr. Simons' wife. Florida law, as the Court's opinion shows, grants dower only to a woman who \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 89]\n\u00a0\n is the legal wife of the husband when he dies. Mrs. Simons therefore had no property rights cut off by the divorce. She simply had her marriage ended by it, and for that reason was not a \"widow\" within the meaning of the Florida law. Unless this Court were to make the novel declaration that Florida cannot limit dower rights to widows, I see no possible way in which the Vanderbilt case, which dealt with rights which a State did give to divorced wives, could be thought to apply.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nWe would dismiss the writ of certiorari in this case as improvidently granted, believing that, as the Court's opinion clearly demonstrates, no federal question is presented. There exists no question under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, because Sol Simons, even after his Florida divorce, \"complied with the full measure of the New York decree,\" ante, at 84.\n\nNo other federal question is even remotely suggested in the present posture of this case. Petitioner asserted in her petition for a writ of certiorari that \"[t]he Courts of Florida have denied to the widow, Lucy C. Simons, her constitutional property rights to which she was entitled . . . by the mere subterfuge of an ex parte divorce case in the Courts of Florida, where the Florida Court did not have jurisdiction because of the lack of proper residence.\" We were advised at oral argument by petitioner's counsel, however, that petitioner no longer challenged the judgment below insofar as it embodied a holding that the 1952 Florida divorce decree was valid and terminated the marital status of the parties.\n\nThe only possible questions which remain in this case, therefore, are questions of state law which are of no proper concern to this Court. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 81, 90]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSINGER v. UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 42\nArgued: November 18, 1964Decided: March 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a defendant in a federal criminal mail fraud case, claims that he had an absolute right to be tried by a judge alone if he considered such a trial to be to his advantage. Held: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23 (a) sets forth a reasonable procedure governing proffered waivers of jury trials. A defendant's only constitutional right concerning the method of trial is to an impartial trial by jury. Although he may waive his right to trial by jury, Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, there is no constitutional impediment to conditioning a waiver of this right on the consent of the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge when, if either refuses to consent, the result is that the defendant is subject to an impartial trial by jury - the very thing that the Constitution guarantees him. Pp. 24-38.\n\n 326 F.2d 132, affirmed.\n\nSidney Dorfman argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nBeatrice Rosenberg argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller and Sidney M. Glazer.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae were filed by Victor Rabinowitz and Leonard Boudin for Joni Rabinowitz, and by Justin A. Stanley for Nicholas Jacop Uselding.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRule 23 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\n \"Cases required to be tried by jury shall be so tried unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing with the approval of the court and the consent of the government.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Petitioner challenges the permissibility of this rule, arguing that the Constitution gives a defendant in a federal criminal case the right to waive a jury trial whenever he believes such action to be in his best interest, regardless of whether the prosecution and the court are willing to acquiesce in the waiver.\n\nPetitioner was charged in a federal district court with 30 infractions of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1341 (1958 ed.). The gist of the indictment was that he used the mails to dupe amateur songwriters into sending him money for the marketing of their songs. On the opening day of trial petitioner offered in writing to waive a trial by jury \"[f]or the purpose of shortening the trial.\"\n1\n The trial court was willing to approve the waiver, but the Government refused to give its consent. Petitioner was subsequently convicted by a jury on 29 of the 30 counts and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. We granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 903\n.\n\nPetitioner's argument is that a defendant in a federal criminal case has not only an unconditional constitutional right, guaranteed by Art. III, 2, and the Sixth Amendment,\n2\n to a trial by jury, but also a correlative right to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n have his case decided by a judge alone if he considers such a trial to be to his advantage. He claims that at common law the right to refuse a jury trial preceded the right to demand one, and that both before and at the time our Constitution was adopted criminal defendants in this country had the right to waive a jury trial. Although the Constitution does not in terms give defendants an option between different modes of trial, petitioner argues that the provisions relating to jury trial are for the protection of the accused. Petitioner further urges that since a defendant can waive other constitutional rights without the consent of the Government, he must necessarily have a similar right to waive a jury trial and that the Constitution's guarantee of a fair trial gives defendants the right to safeguard themselves against possible jury prejudice by insisting on a trial before a judge alone. Turning his attention to Rule 23 (a), petitioner claims that the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments are violated by placing conditions on the ability to waive trial by jury.\n\nWe have examined petitioner's arguments and find them to be without merit. We can find no evidence that the common law recognized that defendants had the right to choose between court and jury trial. Although instances of waiver of jury trial can be found in certain of the colonies prior to the adoption of the Constitution, they were isolated instances occurring pursuant to colonial \"constitutions\" or statutes and were clear departures from the common law. There is no indication that the colonists considered the ability to waive a jury trial to be of equal importance to the right to demand one. Having found that the Constitution neither confers nor recognizes a right of criminal defendants to have their cases tried before a judge alone, we also conclude that Rule 23 (a) sets forth a reasonable procedure governing attempted waivers of jury trials. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nEnglish Common Law. The origin of trial by jury in England is not altogether clear. At its inception it was an alternative to one of the older methods of proof - trial by compurgation, ordeal or battle. I Holdsworth, A History of English Law 326 (7th ed. 1956). Soon after the thirteenth century trial by jury had become the principal institution for criminal cases, Jenks, A Short History of English Law 52 (5th ed. 1938); yet, even after the older procedures of compurgation, ordeal and battle had passed into disuse, the defendant technically retained the right to be tried by one of them. Before a defendant could be subjected to jury trial his \"consent\" was required, but the Englishmen of the period had a concept of \"consent\" somewhat different from our own. The Statute of Westminster I, 1275, 3 Edw. 1, c. 12, which described defendants who refused to submit to jury trial as \"refus[ing] to stand to the Common Law of the Land,\" marks the beginning of the horrendous practice known as peine forte et dure by which recalcitrant defendants were tortured until death or until they \"consented\" to a jury trial.\n\nIt is significant that defendants who refused to submit to a jury were not entitled to an alternative method of trial,\n3\n and it was only in 1772 that peine forte et dure was officially abolished in England. By a statute enacted in that year, 12 Geo. 3, c. 20, a defendant who stood mute when charged with a felony was deemed to have pleaded guilty. Not until 1827, long after the adoption of our Constitution, did England provide by statute, 7 & 8 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n Geo. 4, c. 28, for the trial of those who stood mute. Even this statute did not give the defendant the right to plead his case before a judge alone, but merely provided that he would be subject to jury trial without his formal consent.\n\nThus, as late as 1827 the English common law gave criminal defendants no option as to the mode of trial. The closest the common law came to such a procedure was that of the \"implied confession,\" described briefly in 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 31 (6th ed. 1787), by which defendants accused of minor offenses did not explicitly admit their guilt but threw themselves on the King's mercy and expressed their willingness to submit to a small fine. Despite the \"implied confession,\" the court heard evidence and could discharge the defendant if it found the evidence wanting. Griswold, The Historical Development of Waiver of Jury Trial in Criminal Cases, 20 Va. L. Rev. 655, 660 (1934). It cannot seriously be argued that this obscure and insignificant procedure, having no applicability to serious offenses, establishes the proposition that at common law defendants had the right to choose the method of trial in all criminal cases. On the contrary, \"[b]y its intrinsic fairness as contrasted with older modes, and by the favor of the crown and the judges, [trial by jury] grew fast to be regarded as the one regular common-law mode of trial, always to be had when no other was fixed.\" Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law 60 (1898).\n\nThe Colonial Experience. The colonies which most freely permitted waiver of jury trial as a matter of course were Massachusetts and Maryland. The \"first constitution\" of Massachusetts - The Body of Liberties of 1641 - contained as Liberty XXIX the following:\n\n \"In all actions at law, it shall be the liberty of the plaintiff and defendant, by mutual consent, to choose \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n whether they will be tried by the Bench or by a Jury, unless it be where the law upon just reason has otherwise determined. The like liberty shall be granted to all persons in Criminal cases.\"\n\n\n It should be noted that Liberty XXIX's language explicitly provided that the right to choose trial by judge alone was subject to change \"where the law upon just reason has otherwise determined.\" Moreover, those drafting and administering the Liberty recognized that it was a departure from the English common law. Grinnell, To What Extent is the Right to Jury Trial Optional in Criminal Cases in Massachusetts? 8 Mass. L. Q. No. 5, 7, 23-25 (1923). Several cases can be cited, at least up until 1692, in which defendants in Massachusetts waived jury trial and were tried by the bench. See Grinnell, supra, at 27-29; Griswold, supra, at 661-664. However, from 1692 on, in light of increasing hostility to the Crown, the colonists of Massachusetts stressed their right to trial by jury, not their right to choose between alternate methods of trial. Instead of being a settled part of the jurisprudence of Massachusetts at the time of the Constitutional Convention, the ability to choose between judge and jury had become a forgotten option in Massachusetts:\n\n \"With the state of mind then existing among the colonists, presumably nobody bothered about this question of any one's wanting to waive a jury. The General Court was then concerned with the question of a man's right to a jury when he asked for it, which they thought in danger. The `Body of Liberties' never having been printed and the nineteen original official manuscript copies having doubtless been lost or forgotten, the `bar' (which did not begin to develop until the beginning of the 18th century) and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n the 18th century people, probably grew up without any general knowledge of the expressly optional character of the right to a jury established as a `fundamental' by the common law of Massachusetts in the colonial period.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n It appears that from the early days of Maryland's colonization minor cases were tried by judges sitting alone. Bond, The Maryland Practice of Trying Criminal Cases by Judges Alone, Without Juries, 11 A. B. A. J. 699, 700 (1925). But the defendant who submitted his case to the judge was not considered on a par with the defendant who chose to have a jury hear his case, as is evidenced by a Maryland statute of 1793 which provided that submission to a judge would be considered an admission of crime (analogous to the \"implied confession\" of minor offenses under English common law) at least insofar as to render the person submitting his case to a judge liable for the costs of prosecution. In 1809, Maryland declared by statute that waiver of jury trial was to be encouraged and the willing defendant was to suffer no increased liability for so doing. It was not until 1823, however, that major cases began also to be submitted to judges alone, and the first major case so submitted caused some surprise and sharp comment in Maryland legal circles. See Bond, supra, at 701.\n\nOther possible examples of optional jury trial procedures can be cited in colonial New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n5\n See Griswold, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n supra, at 664-667. The most that can be said for these examples is that they are evidence that the colonists believed it was possible to try criminal defendants without a jury. They in no way show that there was any general recognition of a defendant's right to be tried by the court instead of by a jury. Indeed, if there had been recognition of such a right, it would be difficult to understand why Article III and the Sixth Amendment were not drafted in terms which recognized an option.\n\nThe Constitution and Its Judicial Interpretation. The proceedings at the Constitutional Convention give little insight into what was meant by the direction in Art. III, 2, that the \"Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be by jury.\" The clause was clearly intended to protect the accused from oppression by the Government, see III Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention 101 (James Wilson), 221-222 (Luther Martin) (1911); but, since the practice of permitting defendants a choice as to the mode of trial was not widespread, it is not surprising that some of the framers apparently believed that the Constitution designated trial by jury as the exclusive method of determining guilt, see The Federalist, No. 83 (Alexander Hamilton) (Cooke ed. 1961); IV Elliot's Debates 145, 171 (James Iredell) (2d ed. 1876); III Elliot's Debates 521 (Edmund Pendleton) (2d ed. 1876).\n\nIn no known federal criminal case in the period immediately following the adoption of the Constitution did a defendant claim that he had the right to insist upon a trial without a jury. Indeed, in United States v. Gibert, 25 Fed. Cas. 1287 (No. 15204) (C. C. D. Mass. 1834), Mr. Justice Story, while sitting on circuit, indicated his view that the Constitution made trial by jury the only permissible method of trial. Similar views were expressed by other federal judges. See Ex parte McClusky, 40 F. 71, 74-75 (C. C. D. Ark. 1889) (by implication); United \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n States v. Taylor, 11 F. 470, 471 (C. C. D. Kan. 1882) (dictum).\n6\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough not necessary to the holding in the case, in Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343\n, this Court also expressed a view that the Constitution made jury trial the exclusive method of determining guilt in all federal criminal cases. However, in Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65\n, the Court decided there was no constitutional requirement that petty offenses be tried by jury. These two decisions were construed by the lower federal courts as establishing a rule that in all but petty offenses jury trial was a constitutional imperative. See Coates v. United States, 290 F. 134 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1923); Blair v. United States, 241 F. 217, 230 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1917); Frank v. United States, 192 F. 864, 867-868 (C. A. 6th \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n Cir. 1911) (dictum); Low v. United States, 169 F. 86 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1909); Dickinson v. United States, 159 F. 801 (C. A. 1st Cir. 1908), cert. denied, \n213 \nU.S. 92\n.\n\nThe issue whether a defendant could waive a jury trial in federal criminal cases was finally presented to this Court in Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n. The Patton case came before the Court on a certified question from the Eighth Circuit. The wording of the question, id., at 287, is significant:\n\n \"After the commencement of a trial in a Federal Court before a jury of twelve men upon an indictment charging a crime, punishment for which may involve a penitentiary sentence, if one juror becomes incapacitated and unable to further proceed with his work as a juror, can defendant or defendants and the Government through its official representative in charge of the case consent to the trial proceeding to a finality with eleven jurors, and can defendant or defendants thus waive the right to a trial and verdict by a constitutional jury of twelve men?\"\n\n\n The question explicitly stated that the Government had agreed with the defendant that his trial should proceed with 11 jurors. The case did not involve trial before a judge alone, but the Court believed that trial before 11 jurors was as foreign to the common law as was trial before a judge alone, and therefore both forms of waiver \"in substance amount[ed] to the same thing.\" Id., at 290. The Court examined Art. III, 2, and the Sixth Amendment and concluded that a jury trial was a right which the accused might \"forego at his election.\" Id., at 298. The Court also spoke of jury trial as a \"privilege,\" not an \"imperative requirement,\" ibid., and remarked that jury trial was principally for the benefit of the accused, id., at 312. Nevertheless, the Court was conscious of the precise question that was presented by the Eighth Circuit, and concluded its opinion, id., at 312-313, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n with carefully chosen language that dispelled any notion that the defendant had an absolute right to demand trial before a judge sitting alone:\n\n \"Not only must the right of the accused to a trial  by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but  the maintenance of the jury as a fact finding body  in criminal cases is of such importance and has such  a place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can  become effective, the consent of government counsel  and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition  to the express and intelligent consent of the  defendant. And the duty of the trial court in that  regard is not to be discharged as a mere matter of  rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an  eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from  that mode of trial or from any of the essential elements  thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree  as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.\"\n\n\n In Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, \n317 \nU.S. 269, 277\n-278, this Court reaffirmed the position taken in Patton that \"one charged with a serious federal crime may dispense with his Constitutional right to jury trial, where this action is taken with his express, intelligent consent, where the Government also consents, and where such action is approved by the responsible judgment of the trial court.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThus, there is no federally recognized right to a criminal trial before a judge sitting alone, but a defendant can, as was held in Patton, in some instances waive his right to a trial by jury. The question remains whether the effectiveness of this waiver can be conditioned upon the consent of the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge.\n\nThe ability to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the opposite \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n of that right. For example, although a defendant can, under some circumstances, waive his constitutional right to a public trial, he has no absolute right to compel a private trial, see United States v. Kobli, 172 F.2d 919, 924 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1949) (by implication); although he can waive his right to be tried in the State and district where the crime was committed, he cannot in all cases compel transfer of the case to another district, see Platt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., \n376 \nU.S. 240, 245\n; Kersten v. United States, 161 F.2d 337, 339 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1947), cert. denied, \n331 \nU.S. 851\n; and although he can waive his right to be confronted by the witnesses against him, it has never been seriously suggested that he can thereby compel the Government to try the case by stipulation. Moreover, it has long been accepted that the waiver of constitutional rights can be subjected to reasonable procedural regulations: Rule 7 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedure to be followed for waiver of the right to be prosecuted by indictment; Rule 20 describes the procedure for waiver of the right to be tried in the district in which an indictment or information is pending against a defendant; and Rule 44 deals with the waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nTrial by jury has been established by the Constitution as the \"normal and . . . preferable mode of disposing of issues of fact in criminal cases.\" Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 312\n. As with any mode that might be devised to determine guilt, trial by jury has its weaknesses and the potential for misuse. However, the mode itself has been surrounded with safeguards to make it as fair as possible - for example, venue can be changed when there is a well-grounded fear of jury prejudice, Rule 21 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and prospective jurors are subject to voir dire examination, to challenge for cause, and to peremptory challenge, Rule 24 (a) and (b). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the Constitution's emphasis on jury trial, we find it difficult to understand how the petitioner can submit the bald proposition that to compel a defendant in a criminal case to undergo a jury trial against his will is contrary to his right to a fair trial or to due process. A defendant's only constitutional right concerning the method of trial is to an impartial trial by jury. We find no constitutional impediment to conditioning a waiver of this right on the consent of the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge when, if either refuses to consent, the result is simply that the defendant is subject to an impartial trial by jury - the very thing that the Constitution guarantees him. The Constitution recognizes an adversary system as the proper method of determining guilt, and the Government, as a litigant, has a legitimate interest in seeing that cases in which it believes a conviction is warranted are tried before the tribunal which the Constitution regards as most likely to produce a fair result. This recognition of the Government's interest as a litigant has an analogy in Rule 24 (b) of the federal rules, which permits the Government to challenge jurors peremptorily.\n\nWe are aware that the States have adopted a variety of procedures relating to the waiver of jury trials in state criminal cases. Some have made waiver contingent on approval by the prosecutor, e. g., California (Cal. Const. Art. I, 7), Indiana (Ind. Ann. Stat. 9-1803 (1956 Repl. vol.), Alldredge v. Indiana, 239 Ind. 256, 156 N. E. 2d 888 (1959)), and Virginia (Va. Const. 8, Va. Code Ann. 19.1-192 (1950 Repl. vol.), Boaze v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 786, 183 S. E. 263 (1936)). Others, while not giving the prosecutor a voice, have made court approval a prerequisite for waiver, e. g., Georgia (Ga. Code Ann. 102-106 (1955), Palmer v. State, 195 Ga. 661, 25 S. E. 2d 295 (1943)), and Washington (Wash. Rev. Code 10.01.060 (1963 Supp.)). Still others have provided \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 37]\n\u00a0\n that the question of waiver is a matter solely for the defendant's informed decision, e. g., Connecticut (Conn. Gen. Stat. Rev. 54-82 (1958)), and Illinois (Ill. Ann. Stat. c. 38, 103-6 (Smith-Hurd ed. 1964), Illinois v. Spegal, 5 Ill. 2d 211, 125 N. E. 2d 468 (1955)). However, the framers of the federal rules were aware of possible alternatives when they recommended the present rule to this Court, see Orfield, Trial by Jury in Federal Criminal Procedure, 1962 Duke L. J. 29, 69-72; this Court promulgated the rule as recommended; and Congress can be deemed to have adopted it, 18 U.S.C. 3771 (1958 ed.).\n\nIn upholding the validity of Rule 23 (a), we reiterate the sentiment expressed in Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 88\n, that the government attorney in a criminal prosecution is not an ordinary party to a controversy, but a \"servant of the law\" with a \"twofold aim . . . that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.\" It was in light of this concept of the role of prosecutor that Rule 23 (a) was framed, and we are confident that it is in this light that it will continue to be invoked by government attorneys. Because of this confidence in the integrity of the federal prosecutor, Rule 23 (a) does not require that the Government articulate its reasons for demanding a jury trial at the time it refuses to consent to a defendant's proffered waiver. Nor should we assume that federal prosecutors would demand a jury trial for an ignoble purpose. We need not determine in this case whether there might be some circumstances where a defendant's reasons for wanting to be tried by a judge alone are so compelling that the Government's insistence on trial by jury would result in the denial to a defendant of an impartial trial. Petitioner argues that there might arise situations where \"passion, prejudice . . . public feeling\"\n7\n or some other \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 38]\n\u00a0\n factor may render impossible or unlikely an impartial trial by jury. However, since petitioner gave no reason for wanting to forgo jury trial other than to save time, this is not such a case, and petitioner does not claim that it is.\n\nPetitioner has also raised questions involving the instructions to the jury and alleged misconduct by the prosecuting attorney. We have examined the record and find that the jury was adequately instructed. In any event, no timely objection was made as required by Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and, in the absence of plain error, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Similarly without merit are petitioner's specifications of misconduct by the prosecuting attorney during the trial, since the record reveals that the misconduct, if any, was neither purposeful nor flagrant, and the trial court's admonitions to the jury seem to have been well designed to cure whatever prejudicial impact some of the prosecutor's remarks may have had in this case.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] R. 17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Art. III, 2, of the United States Constitution provides: \"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\" The Sixth Amendment provides: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It appears that many hardy defendants were willing to be tortured to death rather than submit to a jury trial, not because of any inherent distrust of the jury system but because of their desire to avoid a conviction and thereby prevent forfeiture of their lands and the resultant hardships for their descendants. Cf. I Holdsworth, supra, at 326.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Grinnell, supra, at 33.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Pennsylvania case of Proprietor v. Wilkins, Pennypacker's Pennsylvania Colonial Cases 88 (1892), decided in 1685-1686, is of interest in that the court tried a fornication case without a jury over the objection of the prosecution. The punishment involved in the case was a 10-pound fine. The case is, therefore, little authority for the proposition that defendants had the right to waive jury trials in all cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In construing their own constitutions, which generally had clauses designed to preserve the common-law right to trial by jury, the state courts took a similarly limited view of the ability of a defendant to waive jury trial. Some state courts ruled that in the absence of a statute there could be no waiver of jury trial. See, e. g., Wilson v. State, 16 Ark. 601 (1855); State v. Maine, 27 Conn. 281 (1858); People v. Smith, 9 Mich. 193 (1861). Several other courts determined that the State could by statute prohibit waiver of jury trials. See, e. g., Arnold v. Nebraska, 38 Neb. 752, 57 N. W. 378 (1894); In re McQuown, 19 Okla. 347, 91 P. 689 (1907); State v. Battey, 32 R. I. 475, 80 A. 10 (1911); State v. Hirsch, 91 Vt. 330, 100 A. 877 (1917); Mays v. Commonwealth, 82 Va. 550 (1886). Some state courts interpreted their constitutions to say that under no circumstances could waiver be allowed. See, e. g., State v. Holt, 90 N.C. 749 (1884); Williams v. State, 12 Ohio St. 622 (1861). Several courts, of course, held that waiver of a jury was permissible, even in the absence of enabling legislation. See, e. g., State ex rel. Warner v. Baer, 103 Ohio St. 585, 134 N. E. 786 (1921) (overruling Williams v. State, supra); Ex parte King, 42 Okla. Cr. 46, 274 P. 682 (Okla. Crim. App. 1929). In Hallinger v. Davis, \n146 \nU.S. 314\n, this Court held that a state statute permitting waiver of jury trial in criminal cases did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioner's Brief, p. 24. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 24, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

TEXAS(1965)\nNo. 40\nArgued: November 12, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Pursuant to a Texas statute a district judge issued a warrant describing petitioner's home and authorizing the search and seizure there of \"books, records, pamphlets, cards, receipts, lists, memoranda, pictures, recordings and other written instruments concerning the Communist Party of Texas.\" Officers conducted a search for more than four hours, seizing more than 2,000 items, including stock in trade of petitioner's business and personal books, papers and documents, but no \"records of the Communist Party\" or any \"party lists and dues payments.\" Petitioner filed a motion with the magistrate who issued the warrant to have it annulled and the property returned; but the motion was denied. Held: The protections of the Fourth Amendment are by the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed against invasion by the States, and the States may not constitutionally issue general warrants which do not describe with particularity the things to be seized, a requirement of the most scrupulous exactitude where the seizure also impinges upon First Amendment freedoms. Pp. 480-486.\n\n Order vacated and cause remanded.\n\nMaury Maverick, Jr., and John J. McAvoy argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the briefs was Melvin L. Wulf.\n\nJames E. Barlow and Hawthorne Phillips argued the cause for respondent. With them on the brief were Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of Texas, and Howard M. Fender and Lonny F. Zwiener, Assistant Attorneys General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn December 27, 1963, several Texas law-enforcement officers presented themselves at the petitioner's San \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Antonio home for the purpose of searching it under authority of a warrant issued by a local magistrate. By the time they had finished, five hours later, they had seized some 2,000 of the petitioner's books, pamphlets, and papers. The question presented by this case is whether the search and seizure were constitutionally valid.\n\nThe warrant was issued under 9 of Art. 6889-3A of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. That Article, enacted in 1955 and known as the Suppression Act, is a sweeping and many-faceted law which, among other things, outlaws the Communist Party and creates various individual criminal offenses, each punishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. Section 9 authorizes the issuance of a warrant \"for the purpose of searching for and seizing any books, records, pamphlets, cards, receipts, lists, memoranda, pictures, recordings, or any written instruments showing that a person or organization is violating or has violated any provision of this Act.\" The section sets forth various procedural requirements, among them that \"if the premises to be searched constitute a private residence, such application for a search warrant shall be accompanied by the affidavits of two credible citizens.\"\n\nThe application for the warrant was filed in a Bexar County court by the Criminal District Attorney of that County. It recited that the applicant\n\n\". . . has good reason to believe and does believe that a certain place and premises in Bexar County, Texas, described as two white frame houses and one garage, located at the address of 1118 West Rosewood, in the City of San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, and being the premises under the control and in charge of John William Stanford, Jr., is a place where books, records, pamphlets, cards, receipts, lists, memoranda, pictures, recordings and other written instruments \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n concerning the Communist Party of Texas, and the operations of the Communist Party in Texas are unlawfully possessed and used in violation of Articles 6889-3\n1\n and 6889-3A, Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas, and that such belief of this officer is founded upon the following information:\n\n\n\"That this officer has received information from two credible persons that the party named above has such books and records in his possession which are books and records of the Communist Party including party lists and dues payments, and in addition other items listed above. That such information is of recent origin and has been confirmed by recent mailings by Stanford on the 12th of December, 1963 of pro-Communist material.\"\n\n\n Attached to the application was an affidavit signed by two Assistant Attorneys General of Texas. The affidavit repeated the words of the application, except that the basis for the affiants' belief was stated to be as follows:\n\n\"Recent mailings by Stanford on the 12th of December, 1963, of material from his home address, such material being identified as pro-Communist material and other information received in the course of investigation that Stanford has in his possession the books and records of the Texas Communist Party.\"\n\n\n The district judge issued a warrant which specifically described the premises to be searched, recited the allegations of the applicant's and affiants' belief that the premises were \"a place where books, records, pamphlets, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n cards, receipts, lists, memoranda, pictures, recordings and other written instruments concerning the Communist Party of Texas, and the operations of the Communist Party in Texas are unlawfully possessed and used in violation of Article 6889-3 and Article 6889-3A, Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas,\" and ordered the executing officers \"to enter immediately and search the above described premises for such items listed above unlawfully possessed in violation of Article 6889-3 and Article 6889-3A, Revised Civil Statutes, State of Texas, and to take possession of same.\"\n\nThe warrant was executed by the two Assistant Attorneys General who had signed the affidavit, accompanied by a number of county officers. They went to the place described in the warrant, which was where the petitioner resided and carried on a mail order book business under the trade name \"All Points of View.\"\n2\n The petitioner was not at home when the officers arrived, but his wife was, and she let the officers in after one of them had read the warrant to her.\n\nAfter some delay occasioned by an unsuccessful effort to locate the petitioner in another part of town, the search began. Under the general supervision of one of the Assistant Attorneys General the officers spent more than four hours in gathering up about half the books they found in the house. Most of the material they took came from the stock in trade of the petitioner's business, but they took a number of books from his personal library as well. The books and pamphlets taken comprised approximately 300 separate titles, in addition to numerous issues of several different periodicals. Among the books taken were works by such diverse writers as Karl Marx, Jean Paul Sartre, Theodore Draper, Fidel Castro, Earl \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n Browder, Pope John XXIII, and MR. JUSTICE HUGO L. BLACK. The officers also took possession of many of the petitioner's private documents and papers, including his marriage certificate, his insurance policies, his household bills and receipts, and files of his personal correspondence. All this material was packed into 14 cartons and hauled off to an investigator's office in the county courthouse. The officers did not find any \"records of the Communist Party\" or any \"party lists and dues payments.\"\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion with the magistrate who had issued the warrant, asking him to annul the warrant and order the return of all the property which had been seized under it. The motion asserted several federal constitutional claims. After a hearing the motion was denied without opinion. This order of denial was, as the parties agree, final and not appealable or otherwise reviewable under Texas law. See Ex parte Wolfson, 127 Tex. Cr. R. 277, 75 S. W. 2d 440. Accordingly, we granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 989\n. See Thompson v. City of Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199, 202\n-203.\n\nThe petitioner has attacked the constitutional validity of this search and seizure upon several grounds. We rest our decision upon just one, without pausing to assess the substantiality of the others. For we think it is clear that this warrant was of a kind which it was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to forbid - a general warrant. Therefore, even accepting the premise that some or even all of the substantive provisions of Articles 6889-3 and 6889-3A of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas are constitutional and have not been pre-empted by federal law,\n3\n even accepting the premise that the warrant sufficiently specified the offense believed to have been committed and was issued upon probable cause,\n4\n the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n magistrate's order denying the motion to annul the warrant and return the property must nonetheless be set aside.\n\nIt is now settled that the fundamental protections of the Fourth Amendment are guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against invasion by the States. Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25, 27\n; Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n; Ker v. California, \n374 \nU.S. 23\n. The Fourth Amendment provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nThese words are precise and clear. They reflect the determination of those who wrote the Bill of Rights that the people of this new Nation should forever \"be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\" from intrusion and seizure by officers acting under the unbridled authority of a general warrant. Vivid in the memory of the newly independent Americans were those general warrants known as writs of assistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the colonists. The hated writs of assistance had given customs officials blanket authority to search where they pleased for goods imported in violation of the British tax laws. They were denounced by James Otis as \"the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book,\" because they placed \"the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\" The historic occasion of that denunciation, in 1761 at Boston, has been characterized as \"perhaps the most prominent event which inaugurated the resistance of the colonies to the oppressions of the mother country. `Then and there,' said John Adams, `then and there was the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child Independence was born.'\" Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 625\n.\n\nBut while the Fourth Amendment was most immediately the product of contemporary revulsion against a regime of writs of assistance, its roots go far deeper. Its adoption in the Constitution of this new Nation reflected the culmination in England a few years earlier of a struggle against oppression which had endured for centuries. The story of that struggle has been fully chronicled in the pages of this Court's reports,\n5\n and it would be a needless exercise in pedantry to review again the detailed history of the use of general warrants as instruments of oppression from the time of the Tudors, through the Star Chamber, the Long Parliament, the Restoration, and beyond.\n\nWhat is significant to note is that this history is largely a history of conflict between the Crown and the press. It was in enforcing the laws licensing the publication of literature and, later, in prosecutions for seditious libel that general warrants were systematically used in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. In Tudor England officers of the Crown were given roving commissions to search where they pleased in order to suppress and destroy the literature of dissent, both Catholic and Puritan.\n6\n In later years warrants were sometimes more specific in content, but they typically authorized the arrest and search of the premises of all persons connected with the publication of a particular libel, or \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n the arrest and seizure of all the papers of a named person thought to be connected with a libel.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIt was in the context of the latter kinds of general warrants that the battle for individual liberty and privacy was finally won - in the landmark cases of Wilkes v. Wood\n8\n and Entick v. Carrington.\n9\n The Wilkes case arose out of the Crown's attempt to stifle a publication called The North Briton, anonymously published by John Wilkes, then a member of Parliament - particularly issue No. 45 of that journal. Lord Halifax, as Secretary of State, issued a warrant ordering four of the King's messengers \"to make strict and diligent search for the authors, printers, and publishers of a seditious and treasonable paper, entitled, The North Briton, No. 45, . . . and them, or any of them, having found, to apprehend and seize, together with their papers.\"\n10\n \"Armed with their roving commission, they set forth in quest of unknown offenders; and unable to take evidence, listened to rumors, idle tales, and curious guesses. They held in their hands the liberty of every man whom they were pleased to suspect.\"\n11\n Holding that this was \"a ridiculous warrant against the whole English nation,\"\n12\n the Court of Common Pleas awarded Wilkes damages against the Secretary of State. John Entick was the author of a publication called Monitor or British Freeholder. A warrant was issued specifically naming him and that publication, and authorizing his arrest for seditious libel and the seizure of his \"books and papers.\" The King's messengers executing the warrant ransacked Entick's home for four hours and carted \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n away quantities of his books and papers. In an opinion which this Court has characterized as a wellspring of the rights now protected by the Fourth Amendment,\n13\n Lord Camden declared the warrant to be unlawful. \"This power,\" he said, \"so assumed by the secretary of state is an execution upon all the party's papers, in the first instance. His house is rifled; his most valuable secrets are taken out of his possession, before the paper for which he is charged is found to be criminal by any competent jurisdiction, and before he is convicted either of writing, publishing, or being concerned in the paper.\" Entick v. Carrington.\n14\n Thereafter, the House of Commons passed two resolutions condemning general warrants, the first limiting its condemnation to their use in cases of libel, and the second condemning their use generally.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThis is the history which prompted the Court less than four years ago to remark that \"[t]he use by government of the power of search and seizure as an adjunct to a system for the suppression of objectionable publications is not new.\" Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717\n, at 724. \"This history was, of course, part of the intellectual matrix within which our own constitutional fabric was shaped. The Bill of Rights was fashioned against the background of knowledge that unrestricted power of search and seizure could also be an instrument for stifling liberty of expression.\" Id., at 729. As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS has put it, \"The commands of our First Amendment \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n (as well as the prohibitions of the Fourth and the Fifth) reflect the teachings of Entick v. Carrington, supra. These three amendments are indeed closely related, safeguarding not only privacy and protection against self-incrimination but `conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression as well.'\" Frank v. Maryland, \n359 \nU.S. 360, 376\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nIn short, what this history indispensably teaches is that the constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the \"things to be seized\" is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the \"things\" are books, and the basis for their seizure is the ideas which they contain.\n16\n See Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717\n; A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, \n378 \nU.S. 205\n. No less a standard could be faithful to First Amendment freedoms. The constitutional impossibility of leaving the protection of those freedoms to the whim of the officers charged with executing the warrant is dramatically underscored by what the officers saw fit to seize under the warrant in this case.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\"The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\" Marron v. United States, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n \n275 \nU.S. 192\n, at 196. We need not decide in the present case whether the description of the things to be seized would have been too generalized to pass constitutional muster, had the things been weapons, narcotics or \"cases of whiskey.\" See Steele v. United States No. 1, \n267 \nU.S. 498, 504\n.\n18\n The point is that it was not any contraband of that kind which was ordered to be seized, but literary material - \"books, records, pamphlets, cards, receipts, lists, memoranda, pictures, recordings and other written instruments concerning the Communist Party of Texas, and the operations of the Communist Party in Texas.\" The indiscriminate sweep of that language is constitutionally intolerable. To hold otherwise would be false to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, false to its meaning, and false to its history.\n\n\n Two centuries have passed since the historic decision in Entick v. Carrington, almost to the very day. The world has greatly changed, and the voice of nonconformity now sometimes speaks a tongue which Lord Camden might find hard to understand. But the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee to John Stanford that no official of the State shall ransack his home and seize his books and papers under the unbridled authority of a general warrant - no less than the law 200 years ago shielded John Entick from the messengers of the King.\n\nThe order is vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 6889-3 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, enacted in 1951 and known as the Texas Communist Control Law, provides, among other things, that various people and organizations defined by the law who fail to register with the Texas Department of Public Safety are guilty of criminal offenses punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The petitioner had obtained a certificate to transact business under this trade name in accordance with the Texas \"Assumed Name Law.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Pennsylvania v.

Petitioner's principal place of business purportedly is Pennsylvania, where for purposes of diversity jurisdiction it claimed citizenship, though some of its members reside in North Carolina. Petitioner removed the case to a Federal District Court, which refused to remand, finding no proper basis for treating an unincorporated labor union differently from a corporation. On interlocutory appeal the Court of Appeals reversed and directed that the case be remanded to the state court. Held:\n\n 1. Article III, 2, of the Constitution extends federal jurisdiction to suits between \"citizens\" of different States. A corporation for diversity purposes has long been deemed to be a citizen of the State in which it is incorporated, Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497; Marshall v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 16 How. 314, and such status is recognized by statute. 28 U.S.C. 1332 (c). Pp. 147-148.\n\n\n 2. An unincorporated labor union is not a \"citizen\" for purposes of the statute conferring diversity jurisdiction, its citizenship being deemed that of each of its members. Chapman v. Barney, \n129 \nU.S. 677\n, followed; Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476\n, distinguished.

JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent, a North Carolina corporation, brought this action in a North Carolina state court. It sought $200,000 in damages for defamation alleged to have occurred during the course of the United Steelworkers' campaign to unionize respondent's employees. The Steelworkers, an unincorporated labor union whose principal place of business purportedly is Pennsylvania, removed the case to a Federal District Court.\n1\n The union asserted not only federal-question jurisdiction, but that for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction it was a citizen of Pennsylvania, although some of its members were North Carolinians.\n\nThe corporation sought to have the case remanded to the state courts, contending that its complaint raised no federal questions and relying upon the generally prevailing principle that an unincorporated association's citizenship is that of each of its members. But the District Court retained jurisdiction. The District Judge noted \"a trend to treat unincorporated associations in the same manner as corporations and to treat them as citizens of the state wherein the principal office is located.\" Divining \"no common sense reason for treating an unincorporated national labor union differently from a corporation,\" he declined to follow what he styled \"the poorer reasoned but more firmly established rule\" of Chapman v. Barney, \n129 \nU.S. 677\n.\n\nOn interlocutory appeal the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed that the case be remanded \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 147]\n\u00a0\n to the state courts. 336 F.2d 160. Certiorari was granted, \n379 \nU.S. 958\n, so that we might decide whether an unincorporated labor union is to be treated as a citizen for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction, without regard to the citizenship of its members.\n2\n Because we believe this properly a matter for legislative consideration which cannot adequately or appropriately be dealt with by this Court, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n\nArticle III, 2, of the Constitution provides:\n\n\"The judicial Power shall extend . . . to Controversies . . . between Citizens of different States . . . .\"\n\n\n Congress lost no time in implementing the grant. In 1789 it provided for federal jurisdiction in suits \"between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.\"\n3\n There shortly arose the question as to whether a corporation - a creature of state law - is to be deemed a \"citizen\" for purposes of the statute. This Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, initially responded in the negative, holding that a corporation was not a \"citizen\" and that it might sue and be sued under the diversity statute only if none of its shareholders was a co-citizen of any opposing party. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61. In 1844 the Court reversed itself and ruled that a corporation was to be treated as a citizen of the State which created it. Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497. Ten years later, the Court reached the same result by a different approach. In a compromise destined to endure for over a century,\n4\n the Court indulged in the fiction that, although a corporation was not itself a citizen for diversity purposes, its shareholders would conclusively be presumed citizens of the incorporating State. Marshall v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 16 How. 314.\n\nCongress re-entered the lists in 1875, significantly expanding diversity jurisdiction by deleting the requirement imposed in 1789 that one of the parties must be a citizen of the forum State.\n5\n The resulting increase in the quantity of diversity litigation, however, cooled enthusiasts of the jurisdiction, and in 1887 and 1888 Congress enacted sharp curbs. It quadrupled the jurisdictional amount, confined the right of removal to nonresident defendants, reinstituted protections against jurisdiction by collusive assignment, and narrowed venue.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt was in this climate that the Court in 1889 decided Chapman v. Barney, supra. On its own motion the Court observed that plaintiff was a joint stock company and not a corporation or natural person. It held that although plaintiff was endowed by New York with capacity to sue, it could not be considered a \"citizen\" for diversity purposes. \n129 \nU.S., at 682\n.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn recent years courts and commentators have reflected dissatisfaction with the rule of Chapman v. Barney.\n8\n The distinction between the \"personality\" and \"citizenship\" of corporations and that of labor unions and other unincorporated associations, it is increasingly argued, has become artificial and unreal. The mere fact that a corporation is endowed with a birth certificate is, they say, of no consequence. In truth and in fact, they point out, many voluntary associations and labor unions are indistinguishable from corporations in terms of the reality \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n of function and structure, and to say that the latter are juridical persons and \"citizens\" and the former are not is to base a distinction upon an inadequate and irrelevant difference. They assert, with considerable merit, that it is not good judicial administration, nor is it fair, to remit a labor union or other unincorporated association to vagaries of jurisdiction determined by the citizenship of its members and to disregard the fact that unions and associations may exist and have an identity and a local habitation of their own.\n\nThe force of these arguments in relation to the diversity jurisdiction is particularized by petitioner's showing in this case. Petitioner argues that one of the purposes underlying the jurisdiction - protection of the nonresident litigant from local prejudice - is especially applicable to the modern labor union. According to the argument, when the nonresident defendant is a major union, local juries may be tempted to favor local interests at its expense. Juries may also be influenced by the fear that unionization would adversely affect the economy of the community and its customs and practices in the field of race relations. In support of these contentions, petitioner has exhibited material showing that during organizational campaigns like that involved in this case, localities have been saturated with propaganda concerning such economic and racial fears. Extending diversity jurisdiction to unions, says petitioner, would make available the advantages of federal procedure, Article III judges less exposed to local pressures than their state court counterparts, juries selected from wider geographical areas, review in appellate courts reflecting a multi-state perspective, and more effective review by this Court.\n\nWe are of the view that these arguments, however appealing, are addressed to an inappropriate forum, and that pleas for extension of the diversity jurisdiction to \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n hitherto uncovered broad categories of litigants ought to be made to the Congress and not to the courts.\n\nPetitioner urges that in Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476\n, we have heretofore breached the doctrinal wall of Chapman v. Barney and, that step having been taken, there is now no necessity for enlisting the assistance of Congress. But Russell does not furnish the precedent which petitioner seeks. The problem which it presented was that of fitting an exotic creation of the civil law, the sociedad en comandita, into a federal scheme which knew it not. The Organic Act of Puerto Rico conferred jurisdiction upon the federal court if all the parties on either side of a controversy were citizens of a foreign state or \"citizens of a State, Territory or District of the United States not domiciled in Puerto Rico.\"\n9\n All of the sociedad's members were nonresidents of Puerto Rico, and jurisdiction lay in the federal court if they were the \"parties\" to the action. But this Court held that the sociedad itself, not its members, was the party, doing so on a basis that is of no help to petitioner. It did so because, as Justice Stone stated for the Court, in \"[t]he tradition of the civil law, as expressed in the Code of Puerto Rico,\" \"the sociedad is consistently regarded as a juridical person.\" \n288 \nU.S., at 480\n-481. Accordingly, the Court held that the sociedad, Russell & Co., was a citizen domiciled in Puerto Rico, within the meaning of the Organic Act, and ordered the case remanded to the insular courts. It should be noted that \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n the effect of Russell was to contract jurisdiction of the federal court in Puerto Rico.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIf we were to accept petitioner's urgent invitation to amend diversity jurisdiction so as to accommodate its case, we would be faced with difficulties which we could not adequately resolve. Even if the record here were adequate, we might well hesitate to assume that petitioner's situation is sufficiently representative or typical to form the predicate of a general principle. We should, for example, be obliged to fashion a test for ascertaining of which State the labor union is a citizen. Extending the jurisdiction to corporations raised no such problem, for the State of incorporation was a natural candidate, its arguable irrelevance in terms of the policies underlying the jurisdiction being outweighed by its certainty of application. But even that easy and apparent solution did not dispose of the problem; in 1958 Congress thought it necessary to enact legislation providing that corporations are citizens both of the State of incorporation and of the State in which their principal place of business is located.\n11\n Further, in contemplating a rule which would accommodate petitioner's claim, we are acutely aware of the complications arising from the circumstance that petitioner, like other labor unions, has local as well as national organizations and that these, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n perhaps, should be reckoned with in connection with \"citizenship\" and its jurisdictional incidents.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nWhether unincorporated labor unions ought to be assimilated to the status of corporations for diversity purposes, how such citizenship is to be determined, and what if any related rules ought to apply, are decisions which we believe suited to the legislative and not the judicial branch, regardless of our views as to the intrinsic merits of petitioner's argument - merits stoutly attested by widespread support for the recognition of labor unions as juridical personalities.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nWe affirm the decision below.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C. 1441 (a) (1964 ed.) provides: \"Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner does not here challenge the Court of Appeals' finding with respect to the absence of federal-question jurisdiction. Mention of this finding is omitted from the \"statement of the case\" portion of petitioner's brief. Instead, petitioner expresses an intention, on remand of this case, to raise a different issue - that libel suits brought against unions for conduct arising in the course of an organizational campaign are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board and may not be the subject of litigation, at least initially, in state or federal court.

ALABAMA(1965)\nNo. 64\nArgued: December 8, 1964Decided: March 8, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a Negro, was indicted and convicted of rape in the Circuit Court of Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to death. Of those in the county eligible for jury selection for grand and petit juries 26% are Negroes, while the jury panels since 1953 have averaged 10% to 15% Negroes. In this case there were four or five Negroes on the grand jury panel and two served on the grand jury. Although petit jury venires in criminal cases include an average of six to seven Negroes, no Negro has served on a petit jury in the county since about 1950. Here of the eight Negroes on the venire, two were exempt and six were peremptorily struck by the prosecutor. Petitioner's motions to quash the indictment, to strike the trial jury venire, and to void the trial jury, all based on discrimination in the selection of jurors, were denied and his conviction was affirmed by the Alabama Supreme Court. Held:\n\n 1. A defendant in a criminal case is not constitutionally entitled to a proportionate number of his race on the trial jury or the jury panel. P. 208.\n\n\n 2. Purposeful racial discrimination is not satisfactorily established by showing only that an identifiable group has been underrepresented by as much as 10%. P. 208.\n\n\n 3. There is no evidence in this case that the jury commissioners applied different jury selection standards as between Negroes and whites. P. 209.\n\n\n 4. An imperfect system of selection of jury panels is not equivalent to purposeful racial discrimination. P. 209.\n\n\n 5. The prosecutor's striking of Negroes from the jury panel in one particular case under the peremptory challenge system, which permits a challenge without a reason stated, does not constitute denial of equal protection of the laws. P. 221.\n\n\n 6. Even if a State's systematic striking of Negroes in selecting trial juries raises a prima facie case of discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment the record here is insufficient to establish such systematic striking in the county. Pp. 222-228.\n\n\n  (a) Petitioner has the burden of proof and he has failed to meet it. P. 226. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (b) Total exclusion of Negroes from venires by state officials creates an inference of discrimination, but this rule of proof cannot be applied where it is not shown that the State is responsible for the exclusion of Negroes through peremptory challenges.

Flowers, Attorney General of Alabama.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, Robert Swain, a Negro, was indicted and convicted of rape in the Circuit Court of Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to death. His motions to quash the indictment, to strike the trial jury venire and to declare void the petit jury chosen in the case, all based on alleged invidious discrimination in the selection of jurors, were denied. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, 275 Ala. 508, 156 So.2d 368, and we granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 915\n.\n\nIn support of his claims, petitioner invokes the constitutional principle announced in 1880 in Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303\n, where the Court struck down a state statute qualifying only white people for jury duty. Such a statute was held to contravene the central purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment: \"exemption from unfriendly legislation against [Negroes] distinctively as colored, - exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy . . . .\" \n100 \nU.S., at 308\n. Although a Negro defendant is not entitled to a jury containing members of his race, a State's purposeful \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n or deliberate denial to Negroes on account of race of participation as jurors in the administration of justice violates the Equal Protection Clause. Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 339\n; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565\n. This principle was further elaborated in Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, where, in respect to exclusion from grand juries, the Court said:\n\n \"Whenever by any action of a State, whether through its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded, solely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied . . . .\"\n\n\n And it has been consistently and repeatedly applied in many cases coming before this Court.\n1\n The principle of these cases is broadly based.\n\n\"For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government.\" Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128, 130\n.\n\n\n Further, \"[j]urymen should be selected as individuals, on the basis of individual qualifications, and not as members of a race.\" Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282, 286\n (opinion of Mr. Justice Reed, announcing judgment). Nor is the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n constitutional command forbidding intentional exclusion limited to Negroes. It applies to any identifiable group in the community which may be the subject of prejudice. Hernandez v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 475\n.\n\nBut purposeful discrimination may not be assumed or merely asserted. Brownfield v. South Carolina, \n189 \nU.S. 426\n; Tarrance v. Florida, \n188 \nU.S. 519\n; Smith v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 592\n; Bush v. Kentucky, \n107 \nU.S. 110\n. It must be proven, Tarrance v. Florida, supra; Martin v. Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316\n, the quantum of proof necessary being a matter of federal law. Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128\n. It is not the soundness of these principles, which is unquestioned, but their scope and application to the issues in this case that concern us here.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWe consider first petitioner's claims concerning the selection of grand jurors and the petit jury venire. The evidence was that while Negro males over 21 constitute 26% of all males in the county in this age group, only 10 to 15% of the grand and petit jury panels drawn from the jury box since 1953 have been Negroes, there having been only one case in which the percentage was as high as 23%. In this period of time, Negroes served on 80% of the grand juries selected, the number ranging from one to three. There were four or five Negroes on the grand jury panel of about 33 in this case, out of which two served on the grand jury which indicted petitioner. Although there has been an average of six to seven Negroes on petit jury venires in criminal cases, no Negro has actually served on a petit jury since about 1950. In this case there were eight Negroes on the petit jury venire but none actually served, two being exempt and six being struck by the prosecutor in the process of selecting the jury. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is wholly obvious that Alabama has not totally excluded a racial group from either grand or petit jury panels, as was the case in Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; Hill v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 400\n; Patton v. Mississippi, \n332 \nU.S. 463\n; Hernandez v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 475\n; and Reece v. Georgia, \n350 \nU.S. 85\n. Moreover, we do not consider an average of six to eight Negroes on these panels as constituting forbidden token inclusion within the meaning of the cases in this Court. Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278\n; Akins v. Texas, \n325 \nU.S. 398\n; Avery v. Georgia, \n345 \nU.S. 559\n. Nor do we consider the evidence in this case to make out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAlabama law requires that the three jury commissioners in Talladega County place on the jury roll all male citizens in the community over 21 who are reputed to be honest, intelligent men and are esteemed for their integrity, good character and sound judgment. Ala. Code, Tit. 30, 20, 21 (1958).\n2\n In practice, however, the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n commissioners do not place on the roll all such citizens, either white or colored.\n3\n A typical jury roll at best contains about 2,500 names, out of a total male population over 21, according to the latest census, of 16,406 persons. Each commissioner, with the clerk's assistance, produces for the jury list names of persons who in his judgment are qualified. The sources are city directories, registration lists, club and church lists, conversations with other persons in the community, both white and colored, and personal and business acquaintances.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n\nVenires drawn from the jury box made up in this manner unquestionably contained a smaller proportion of the Negro community than of the white community. But a defendant in a criminal case is not constitutionally entitled to demand a proportionate number of his race on the jury which tries him nor on the venire or jury roll from which petit jurors are drawn. Virginia v. Rives, \n100 \nU.S. 313, 322\n-323; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565\n; Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 282\n; Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282\n. Neither the jury roll nor the venire need be a perfect mirror of the community or accurately reflect the proportionate strength of every identifiable group. \"Obviously the number of races and nationalities appearing in the ancestry of our citizens would make it impossible to meet a requirement of proportional representation. Similarly, since there can be no exclusion of Negroes as a race and no discrimination because of color, proportional limitation is not permissible.\" Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282, 286\n-287 (opinion of Mr. Justice Reed, announcing judgment). We cannot say that purposeful discrimination based on race alone is satisfactorily \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n proved by showing that an identifiable group in a community is underrepresented by as much as 10%. See Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 283\n; Akins v. Texas, \n325 \nU.S. 398\n; Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282\n. Here the commissioners denied that racial considerations entered into their selections of either their contacts in the community or the names of prospective jurors. There is no evidence that the commissioners applied different standards of qualifications to the Negro community than they did to the white community. Nor was there any meaningful attempt to demonstrate that the same proportion of Negroes qualified under the standards being administered by the commissioners. It is not clear from the record that the commissioners even knew how many Negroes were in their respective areas, or on the jury roll or on the venires drawn from the jury box. The overall percentage disparity has been small, and reflects no studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negroes. Undoubtedly the selection of prospective jurors was somewhat haphazard and little effort was made to ensure that all groups in the community were fully represented. But an imperfect system is not equivalent to purposeful discrimination based on race.\n5\n We do not think that the burden of proof was carried by petitioner in this case.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nPetitioner makes a further claim relating to the exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude Negroes from serving on petit juries. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Talladega County the petit jury venire drawn in a criminal case numbers about 35 unless a capital offense is involved, in which case it numbers about 100. Ala. Code, Tit. 30, 60, 62, 63 (1958). After excuses and removals for cause, the venire in a capital case is reduced to about 75. The jury is then \"struck\" - the defense striking two veniremen and the prosecution one in alternating turns, until only 12 jurors remain. Ala. Code, Tit. 30, 64 (1958). This essentially is the Alabama struck-jury system, applicable in all criminal cases and available in civil cases. Ala. Code, Tit. 30, 54, 60 (1958). In this case, the six Negroes available for jury service were struck by the prosecutor in the process of selecting the jury which was to try petitioner.\n\nIn the trial court after the jury was selected, petitioner moved to have the jury declared void on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. Among other things the motion alleged:\n\n \"(4) That because of the systematic and arbitrary method of selecting the names of qualified male citizens, negro male citizens, by the Jury Commission of Talladega County, Alabama, the State can, and did in this case, readily strike members of the negro race and that there were only six negroes remaining on the final venire in this cause, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and also the Constitution of the State of Alabama . . . .\"\n\n\n The main thrust of the motion according to its terms was the striking of the six Negroes from the petit jury venire.\n6\n No evidence was taken, petitioner apparently \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n being content to rely on the record which had been made in connection with the motion to quash the indictment. We think the motion, seeking as it did to invalidate the alleged purposeful striking of Negroes from the jury which was to try petitioner, was properly denied.\n\nIn providing for jury trial in criminal cases, Alabama adheres to the common-law system of trial by an impartial jury of 12 men who must unanimously agree on a verdict,\n7\n the system followed in the federal courts by virtue of the Sixth Amendment. As part of this system it provides for challenges for cause and substitutes a system of strikes for the common-law method of peremptory challenge.\n8\n Alabama contends that its system of peremptory \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n strikes - challenges without cause, without explanation and without judicial scrutiny - affords a suitable and necessary method of securing juries which in fact and in the opinion of the parties are fair and impartial. This system, it is said, in and of itself, provides justification for striking any group of otherwise qualified jurors in any given case, whether they be Negroes, Catholics, accountants or those with blue eyes. Based on the history of this system and its actual use and operation in this country, we think there is merit in this position.\n\nThe peremptory challenge has very old credentials. In all trials for felonies at common law, the defendant was allowed to challenge peremptorily 35 jurors,\n9\n and the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 213]\n\u00a0\n prosecutor originally had a right to challenge any number of jurors without cause, a right which was said to tend to \"infinite delayes and danger.\" Coke on Littleton 156 (14th ed. 1791).\n10\n Thus The Ordinance for Inquests, 33 Edw. 1, Stat. 4 (1305), provided that if \"they that sue for the King will challenge any . . . Jurors, they shall assign . . . a Cause certain.\" So persistent was the view that a proper jury trial required peremptories on both sides, however, that the statute was construed to allow the prosecution to direct any juror after examination to \"stand aside\" until the entire panel was gone over and the defendant had exercised his challenges; only if there was a deficiency of jurors in the box at that point did the Crown have to show cause in respect to jurors recalled to make up the required number.\n11\n Peremptories on both sides became the settled law of England, continuing in the above form until after the separation of the Colonies.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis common law provided the starting point for peremptories in this country. In the federal system, Congress early took a part of the subject in hand in establishing that the defendant was entitled to 35 peremptories in trials for treason and 20 in trials for other felonies specified in the 1790 Act as punishable by death, 1 Stat. 119 (1790). In regard to trials for other offenses without the 1790 statute, both the defendant and the Government were thought to have a right of peremptory challenge, although the source of this right was not wholly clear.\n13\n In 1865, the Government was given by statute five peremptory challenges in capital and treason cases, the defendant being entitled to 20, and two in other cases where the right of the defendant to challenge then existed, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 215]\n\u00a0\n he being entitled to 10. 13 Stat. 500 (1865).\n14\n Subsequent enactments increased the number of challenges the Government could exercise, the Government now having an equal number with the defendant in capital cases, and six in cases where the crime is punishable by more than one year's imprisonment, the defendant or defendants having ten.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe course in the States apparently paralleled that in the federal system. The defendant's right of challenge was early conferred by statute, the number often corresponding to the English practice,\n16\n the prosecution was \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 216]\n\u00a0\n thought to have retained the Crown's common-law right to stand aside,\n17\n and by 1870, most, if not all, States had enacted statutes conferring on the prosecution a substantial number of peremptory challenges, the number generally being at least half, but often equal to, the number had by the defendant.\n18\n Although there has been some criticism in the twentieth century leveled at peremptory challenges, on the basis of the delays, expense and elimination of qualified jurors incident to their use,\n19\n the system \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 217]\n\u00a0\n has survived these attacks. In every State, except where peremptory strikes are a substitute, peremptory challenges are given by statute to both sides in both criminal and civil cases, the number in criminal cases still being considerably greater. Under these statutes the prosecution generally possesses a substantial number of challenges.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nThe system of struck juries also has its roots in ancient common-law heritage.\n21\n Since striking a jury allowed \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 218]\n\u00a0\n both sides a greater number of challenges and an opportunity to become familiar with the entire venire list, it was deemed an effective means of obtaining more impartial and better qualified jurors. Accordingly, it was used in causes of \"great nicety\" or \"where the sheriff [responsible for the jury list] was suspected of partiality.\" 3 Bl. Comm. 357. It is available in many States for both civil and criminal cases.\n22\n The Alabama system adheres to the common-law form, except that the veniremen are drawn from the regular jury list, are summoned to court before striking begins and the striking continues until 12 rather than 24 remain. It was adopted as a fairer system to the defendant and prosecutor and a more efficacious, quicker way to obtain an impartial jury satisfactory to the parties.\n23\n\u00a0\n\nIn contrast to the course in England, where both peremptory challenge and challenge for cause have fallen into disuse, peremptories were and are freely used and relied upon in this country, perhaps because juries here are drawn from a greater cross-section of a heterogeneous society.\n24\n The voir dire in American trials tends to be \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 219]\n\u00a0\n extensive and probing, operating as a predicate for the exercise of peremptories, and the process of selecting a jury protracted.\n25\n The persistence of peremptories and their extensive use demonstrate the long and widely held belief that peremptory challenge is a necessary part of trial by jury. See Lewis v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 370\n 376. Although \"[t]here is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress [or the States] to grant peremptory challenges,\" Stilson v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 583, 586\n, nonetheless the challenge is \"one of the most important of the rights secured to the accused,\" Pointer v. United States, \n151 \nU.S. 396, 408\n. The denial or impairment of the right is reversible error without a showing of prejudice, Lewis v. United States, supra; Harrison v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 140\n; cf. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Shane, \n157 \nU.S. 348\n. \"For it is, as Blackstone says, an arbitrary and capricious right; and it must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full purpose.\" Lewis v. United States, supra, at 378.\n\nThe function of the challenge is not only to eliminate extremes of partiality on both sides, but to assure the parties that the jurors before whom they try the case will decide on the basis of the evidence placed before them, and not otherwise. In this way the peremptory satisfies the rule that \"to perform its high function in the best way `justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.'\" In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133, 136\n. Indeed the very availability of peremptories allows counsel to ascertain the possibility of bias through probing questions on the voir dire and facilitates the exercise of challenges for cause by removing the fear of incurring a juror's hostility \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 220]\n\u00a0\n through examination and challenge for cause. Although historically the incidence of the prosecutor's challenge has differed from that of the accused, the view in this country has been that the system should guarantee \"not only freedom from any bias against the accused, but also from any prejudice against his prosecution. Between him and the state the scales are to be evenly held.\" Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 \nU.S. 68, 70\n.\n\nThe essential nature of the peremptory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reason stated, without inquiry and without being subject to the court's control. State v. Thompson, 68 Ariz. 386, 206 P.2d 1037 (1949); Lewis v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 370, 378\n. While challenges for cause permit rejection of jurors on a narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable basis of partiality, the peremptory permits rejection for a real or imagined partiality that is less easily designated or demonstrable. Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 \nU.S. 68, 70\n. It is often exercised upon the \"sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another,\" Lewis, supra, at 376, upon a juror's \"habits and associations,\" Hayes v. Missouri, supra, at 70, or upon the feeling that \"the bare questioning [a juror's] indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment,\" Lewis, supra, at 376. It is no less frequently exercised on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty.\n26\n For the question a prosecutor or defense \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 221]\n\u00a0\n counsel must decide is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is in fact partial, but whether one from a different group is less likely to be.\n27\n It is well known that these factors are widely explored during the voir dire, by both prosecutor and accused, Miles v. United States, \n103 \nU.S. 304\n; Aldridge v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 308\n.\n28\n This Court has held that the fairness of trial by jury requires no less. Aldridge, supra.\n29\n Hence veniremen are not always judged solely as individuals for the purpose of exercising peremptory challenges. Rather they are challenged in light of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may include their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be tried.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we cannot hold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial of equal protection of the laws. In the quest for an impartial and qualified jury, Negro and white, Protestant and Catholic, are alike subject to being challenged without cause. To subject the prosecutor's challenge in any particular case to the demands and traditional standards of the Equal Protection Clause would entail a radical change \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 222]\n\u00a0\n in the nature and operation of the challenge. The challenge, pro tanto, would no longer be peremptory, each and every challenge being open to examination, either at the time of the challenge or at a hearing afterwards. The prosecutor's judgment underlying each challenge would be subject to scrutiny for reasonableness and sincerity. And a great many uses of the challenge would be banned.\n\nIn the light of the purpose of the peremptory system and the function it serves in a pluralistic society in connection with the institution of jury trial, we cannot hold that the Constitution requires an examination of the prosecutor's reasons for the exercise of his challenges in any given case. The presumption in any particular case must be that the prosecutor is using the State's challenges to obtain a fair and impartial jury to try the case before the court. The presumption is not overcome and the prosecutor therefore subjected to examination by allegations that in the case at hand all Negroes were removed from the jury or that they were removed because they were Negroes. Any other result, we think, would establish a rule wholly at odds with the peremptory challenge system as we know it. Hence the motion to strike the trial jury was properly denied in this case.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nPetitioner, however, presses a broader claim in this Court.\n30\n His argument is that not only were the Negroes \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 223]\n\u00a0\n removed by the prosecutor in this case but that there never has been a Negro on a petit jury in either a civil or criminal case in Talladega County and that in criminal cases prosecutors have consistently and systematically exercised their strikes to prevent any and all Negroes on petit jury venires from serving on the petit jury itself. This systematic practice, it is claimed, is invidious discrimination for which the peremptory system is insufficient justification.\n\nWe agree that this claim raises a different issue and it may well require a different answer. We have decided that it is permissible to insulate from inquiry the removal of Negroes from a particular jury on the assumption that the prosecutor is acting on acceptable considerations related to the case he is trying, the particular defendant involved and the particular crime charged. But when the prosecutor in a county, in case after case, whatever the circumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the removal of Negroes who have been selected as qualified jurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived challenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever serve on petit juries, the Fourteenth Amendment claim takes on added significance. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n. In these circumstances, giving even the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 224]\n\u00a0\n widest leeway to the operation of irrational but trial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the purposes of the peremptory challenge are being perverted. If the State has not seen fit to leave a single Negro on any jury in a criminal case, the presumption protecting the prosecutor may well be overcome. Such proof might support a reasonable inference that Negroes are excluded from juries for reasons wholly unrelated to the outcome of the particular case on trial and that the peremptory system is being used to deny the Negro the same right and opportunity to participate in the administration of justice enjoyed by the white population. These ends the peremptory challenge is not designed to facilitate or justify.\n\nWe need pursue this matter no further, however, for even if a State's systematic striking of Negroes in the selection of petit juries raises a prima facie case under the Fourteenth Amendment, we think it is readily apparent that the record in this case is not sufficient to demonstrate that the rule has been violated by the peremptory system as it operates in Talladega County. Cf. Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60, 87\n.\n\nThe difficulty with the record before us, perhaps flowing from the fact that it was made in connection with the motion to quash the indictment, is that it does not with any acceptable degree of clarity, show when, how often, and under what circumstances the prosecutor alone has been responsible for striking those Negroes who have appeared on petit jury panels in Talladega County. The record is absolutely silent as to those instances in which the prosecution participated in striking Negroes, except for the indication that the prosecutor struck the Negroes in this case and except for those occasions when the defendant himself indicated that he did not want Negroes on the jury. Apparently in some cases, the prosecution \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 225]\n\u00a0\n agreed with the defense to remove Negroes. There is no evidence, however, of what the prosecution did or did not do on its own account in any cases other than the one at bar.\n31\n In one instance the prosecution offered the defendant an all-Negro jury but the defendant in that case did not want a jury with any Negro members. There was other testimony that in many cases the Negro defendant preferred an all-white to a mixed jury. One lawyer, who had represented both white and Negro defendants in criminal cases, could recall no Negro client who wanted Negroes on the jury which was to try him. The prosecutor himself, who had served since 1953, said that if the Negro defendant wanted Negroes on the jury it would depend \"upon the circumstances and the conditions and the case and what I thought justice demanded and what [it] was in that particular case,\" and that striking is done differently depending on the race of the defendant and the victim of the crime. These statements \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 226]\n\u00a0\n do not support an inference that the prosecutor was bent on striking Negroes, regardless of trial-related considerations. The fact remains, of course, that there has not been a Negro on a jury in Talladega County since about 1950. But the responsibility of the prosecutor is not illuminated in this record. There is no allegation or explanation, and hence no opportunity for the State to rebut, as to when, why and under what circumstances in cases previous to this one the prosecutor used his strikes to remove Negroes. In short, petitioner has not laid the proper predicate for attacking the peremptory strikes as they were used in this case. Petitioner has the burden of proof and he has failed to carry it.\n\nA dissent asserts that a showing that there are qualified Negroes and that none have served makes out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination on the part of the State and that the continued vitality of Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303\n, as well as \"a practical accommodation\" between the constitutional right of equal protection and the statutory right of peremptory challenge, requires application of such a rule here. Where discrimination is said to occur in the selection of veniremen by state jury commissioners, \"proof that Negroes constituted a substantial segment of the population . . ., that some Negroes were qualified to serve as jurors, and that none had been called for jury service over an extended period of time . . . constitute[s] prima facie proof of the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service,\" Hernandez v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 475, 480\n, as does proof \"that no Negro had served on a criminal court grand or petit jury for a period of thirty years,\" Patton v. Mississippi, \n332 \nU.S. 463, 466\n. (Emphasis added.) See also Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; Harper v. Mississippi, 251 Miss. 699, 171 So.2d 129 (1965). Total exclusion of Negroes by the state officers \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 227]\n\u00a0\n responsible for selecting names of jurors gives rise to a fair inference of discrimination on their part, an inference which is determinative absent sufficient rebuttal evidence. But this rule of proof cannot be woodenly applied to cases where the discrimination is said to occur during the process of peremptory challenge of persons called for jury service. Unlike the selection process, which is wholly in the hands of state officers, defense counsel participate in the peremptory challenge system, and indeed generally have a far greater role than any officers of the State. It is for this reason that a showing that Negroes have not served during a specified period of time does not, absent a sufficient showing of the prosecutor's participation, give rise to the inference of systematic discrimination on the part of the State. The ordinary exercise of challenges by defense counsel does not, of course, imply purposeful discrimination by state officials. This is not to say that a defendant attacking the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges over a period of time need elicit an admission from the prosecutor that discrimination accounted for his rejection of Negroes, any more than a defendant attacking jury selection need obtain such an admission from the jury commissioners. But the defendant must, to pose the issue, show the prosecutor's systematic use of peremptory challenges against Negroes over a period of time. This is the teaching of Hernandez v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 475\n; Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; Patton v. Mississippi, \n332 \nU.S. 463\n. We see no reason, except for blind application of a proof standard developed in a context where there is no question of state responsibility for the alleged exclusion, why the defendant attacking the prosecutor's systematic use of challenges against Negroes should not be required to establish on the record the prosecutor's conduct in this regard, especially where the same prosecutor \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 228]\n\u00a0\n for many years is said to be responsible for this practice and is quite available for questioning on this matter.\n32\n Accordingly the judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nIn joining the opinion of the Court, I deem it appropriate to emphasize my understanding that the Court reserves, and does not decide, the question which in Part III of its opinion it finds not presented by the record in this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n; Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; Hale v. Kentucky, \n303 \nU.S. 613\n; Pierre v.

The provisions pertinent to this case follow the general state statute and thus all references will be to the latter. Ala. Code, Tit. 30, 21 (1958) provides: \"Qualifications of persons on jury roll. - The jury commission shall place on the jury roll and in the jury box the names of all male citizens of the county who are generally reputed to be honest and intelligent men and are esteemed in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment; but no person must be selected who is under twenty-one or who is an habitual drunkard, or who, being afflicted with a permanent disease or physical weakness is unfit to discharge the duties of a juror; or cannot read English or who has ever been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude. If a person cannot read English and has all the other qualifications prescribed herein and is a freeholder or householder his name may be placed on the jury roll and in the jury box. No person over the age of sixty-five years shall be required to serve on a jury or to remain on the panel of jurors unless he is willing to do so.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Although the statute aims at an exhaustive jury list, failure to include the name of every qualified person on the jury roll is not a ground to quash an indictment or venire, absent fraud or purposeful discrimination. Fikes v. Alabama, 263 Ala. 89, 81 So.2d 303 (1955), rev'd on other grounds, \n352 \nU.S. 191\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The commissioners testified that since 1959 they have met once or twice yearly, for about an hour each meeting, at which time each commissioner presented a list of persons he deemed qualified for jury service. Their names were obtained from disparate sources, each commissioner going about his task in his area of the county in his own way. The chief commissioner testified that with the assistance of city directories, and registration lists, he went out into the beats to which he was assigned and asked persons he knew for suggestions and information. He also secured names from customers of his paint store. He averred that he was familiar with Negro and white members of the community, talked with both, and used the same method for determining the qualifications of both Negro and white citizens. Another commissioner, working a predominantly rural area, testified that membership lists of Farm Bureau Cooperatives in the area and the Rural Electric Cooperative were his main sources of names, both organizations having a substantial number of Negro and white persons. He also relied on the city directory for Talladega City and on the people he knew through his 40 years of residence and farming in the area. He noted that he did not rely on predominantly white social clubs or on Negro churches, adding that he was not familiar with the relative percentage of Negroes or whites in his beats and could not identify the persons on the jury list by race. He also stated that the jury list did not contain the names of all qualified citizens and that compilation of an all-inclusive list would be impossible. The third commissioner testified that he used the telephone \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n directory and went out into the various beats to gather names through local merchants and citizens, both Negro and white. He also relied on the customers of his business. He too was unable to identify the persons on the jury list by race. The clerk stated that she assisted by supplying some additional names to the commissioners; she compiled these names from various directories, church rolls, club rolls and from lists sent by the managers of local plants and industries. She testified that she was acquainted with more white persons than Negroes but that she did not visit the beats or talk with persons in the beats to gather names for the commission's approval. All the commissioners averred that they did not watch the color line in obtaining names, did not know the number of Negroes in their beats, and, accordingly, did not count the number of whites and colored people in preparing the lists. The record contains no admission by the commissioners that they had relatively few Negro acquaintances or that they tended primarily to use white church lists or white club lists.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"`It may be that the jury commissioners did not give the negro race a full pro rata with the white race in the selection of the grand and petit jurors in this case, still this would not be evidence of discrimination. If they fairly and honestly endeavored to discharge their duty, and did not in fact discriminate against the negro race in the selection of the jury lists, then the Constitution of the United States has not been violated.'\" Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 283\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The issue in regard to striking Negroes was raised in a different form in the motion to quash the venire. It read in pertinent part: \"4. Defendant avers the existence of a system or practice in the drawing or organization of juries to serve in Talladega County, Alabama, deliberately designed to discriminate against members of the Negro race in order to prevent them from serving on juries by either \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n excluding them from the venire altogether or by keeping the number included so small that they can be systematically and uniformly struck from the venire and prevented from serving in the trial of any case.\" This claim was repeated in the motion to declare void the petit jury selected. \"(3) That because of the systematic and arbitrary method of selecting the names of qualified male citizens by the jury commission of Talladega County, Alabama, it is impossible for qualified members of the negro race to serve as jurors in this cause or any cause . . . .\" The above claim as well as the objection to the prosecutor's exercise of his strikes against the six Negroes in this case was repeated in the motion for a new trial. No further claims were made and no further evidence was taken on any of these motions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In all prosecutions by indictment the accused has a right to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury in the county in which the offense was committed. Ala. Const. of 1901, 6. See also Ala. Const. of 1901, 11, 12; Collins v. State, 88 Ala. 212, 7 So. 260 (1890).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Alabama had long provided both the defendant and prosecutor with a substantial number of peremptory challenges. Under the 1867 Code, the defendant was entitled to 21 peremptories in capital cases and 15 in noncapital felony cases; correspondingly the State had 14 peremptories in capital trials and 10 in other felony trials. 1867 Ala. Rev. Code 4178, 4179. These numbers were altered in the 1907 Act, the defendant having eight peremptories in a noncapital felony case and the State four. The numbers in capital cases remained \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n the same. 1907 Ala. Code 7275. The struck-jury system was introduced in 1909 as a part of a comprehensive amendment of the statutes governing the selection and impaneling of juries in the State. 1909 Leg. Acts, Spec. Sess., p. 319. The history and purposes of this legislation, as set out by the sponsor of the Act, may be found in John, The Jury Law, 1910-1911 Alabama Bar Assn. Rep. 198: \"The provision for struck juries in criminal cases, is found to be much fairer to the Solicitor and the Attorneys for defendants, and under it a jury can be more easily and quickly obtained, and it would be a decided step backward to restore the challenge system, with its delay and chances for errors.\" Id., at 205.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It was thought that peremptory challenges were allowed at common law in capital felonies only. Thus Blackstone states: \"[I]n criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is, in favorem vitae, allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all; which is called a peremptory challenge: a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners, for which our English laws are justly famous.\" 4 Blackstone Commentaries 353 (15th ed. 1809) (hereafter Bl. Comm.). This statement was not far amiss, since most felonies were generally punishable by death. 4 Bl. Comm. 98. But peremptories were allowable in trials of felonies that were not capital. Gray v. Reg., 11 Cl. & Fin. 427 (H. L. 1844). See I Thompson, Trials 42 (2d ed. 1912) (hereafter Thompson); I Stephen, History of Criminal Law of England 302 (1883) (hereafter Stephen).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The defendant's right remained unaltered until 22 Hen. 8, c. 14, 6 (1530); 25 Hen. 8, c. 3 (1533), when the number was limited to 20 in all cases except high treason. See generally Proffatt, Trial By Jury 156 (1877) (hereafter Proffatt).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Lord Grey's Case, 9 How. St. Tr. 128 (1682); Reg. v. Frost, 9 Car. & P. 129 (1839); Mansell v. Reg., 8 El. & Bl. 54 (1857); 4 Bl. Comm. 353. The number of jurors called was in the discretion of the court and it is reported that the right to stand aside was exercised liberally. Proffatt 160. All attempts to limit or abolish the Crown's right were rejected. Reg. v. Frost, supra; O'Coigly's Case, 26 How. St. Tr. 1191, 1231; I Thompson 49; Busch, Law and Tactics in Jury Trials 69 (1949) (hereafter Busch).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It remains the law of England today, except the number the defendant may now exercise is seven. See 6 Geo. 4, c. 50, 29 (1825); 11 & 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, 35 (Criminal Justice Act of 1948). The actual use of challenges by either side has been rare, for at least a century, but the continued availability of the right is considered important. I Stephen 303; Devlin, Trial By Jury 29-37 (1956) (hereafter Devlin); Howard, Criminal Justice In England 362-364 (1931) (hereafter Howard).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] United States v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412, 414 (Cir. Ct. Pa. 1806). Mr. Justice Washington, sitting on circuit, stated: \"The right of challenge was a privilege highly esteemed, and anxiously guarded, at the common law; and it cannot be doubted, but that at the common law, a prisoner is entitled, on a capital charge, to challenge peremptorily, thirty-five jurors. If, therefore, the act of congress has substituted no other rule . . . the common law rule must be pursued.\" See also United States v. Wilson & Porter, 1 Bald. 78, 82 (Cir. Ct. Pa. 1830); United States v. Douglass, Fed. Cas. No. 14989, 2 Blatch. C. C. 207 (Cir. Ct. S. D. N. Y. 1851). But see United States v. Cottingham, Fed. Cas. No. 14872, 2 Blatch. C. C. 470 (Cir. Ct. N. D. N. Y. 1852). In United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat. 480, this Court indicated that the Crown's power to stand aside was a part of the common law inherited from the English. Federal courts allowed the Government to stand aside on the basis of this decision. United States v. Wilson & Porter, supra; United States v. Douglass, supra. In 1856, the Court held in United States v. Shackleford, 18 How. 588, that federal statutes affording the defendant a right of challenge did not incorporate the Government's right to stand aside. The Government could do this only by virtue of the 1840 Act, 5 Stat. 394, empowering the federal courts to adopt the state practice in regard to selection and impaneling of juries.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] A few years later Congress extended the defendant's right to 10 challenges in all noncapital felony cases and the Government was entitled to three in such cases; it also extended the right to misdemeanors and civil cases, each party being entitled to three. 17 Stat. 282 (1872).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See 36 Stat. 1166, 287 (1911) providing that where the offense is a capital offense or treason, the defendant is entitled to 20 peremptory challenges and the United States to six; in all other felony trials, the defendant has 10, the United States six. Rule 24 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \"(b) Peremptory Challenges. If the offense charged is punishable by death, each side is entitled to 20 peremptory challenges. If the offense charged is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, the government is entitled to 6 peremptory challenges and the defendant or defendants jointly to 10 peremptory challenges. If the offense charged is punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year or by fine or both, each side is entitled to 3 peremptory challenges. If there is more than one defendant, the court may allow the defendants additional peremptory challenges and permit them to be exercised separately or jointly.\" The Government's right to stand aside was deemed to survive early statutes giving the Government peremptory challenges.

However, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court may be read to have ruled on the challenge to the exercise of strikes against Negroes in its broadest form. \"As to the contention that Negroes are systematically excluded from trial juries, the evidence discloses that Negroes are commonly on trial \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 223]\n\u00a0\n venires but are always struck by attorneys in selecting the trial jury. It has long been held that, where allowed by statute, peremptory challenges may be used without any assigned or stated cause. Both the federal and Alabama jurisdictions have statutes providing for peremptory challenges. The fact that the prosecution peremptorily strikes every Negro from the jury panel in a case where the defendant is a Negro does not constitute a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights . . . .\" 275 Ala. 508, 515, 156 So.2d 368, 375 (citations omitted). Cf. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 267\n-268; Charleston Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Alderson, \n324 \nU.S. 182, 185\n-186.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The prosecutor testified that on occasion he would ask defense counsel if he wanted Negroes on the jury; if the defense did not, and the prosecutor agreed, \"what we do then is just to take them off. Strike them first.\" The record makes clear that this was not a general practice and the matter was not explored further: \"Q. Let me ask you this. You stated that the defendants generally do not want a negro to serve on a jury that is sworn to try him? \"A. I didn't say that. I didn't - they generally didn't want it. I said in the past there has been occasion here where that has happened. \"Q. Have there been any cases where they did want negroes to serve on juries in their behalf? \"A. I wouldn't know if there has been. Not to my knowledge, because I am not representing defendants. I am representing the State. Do you see what I mean? \"Q. Yes. \"A. In other words, that would be between attorney and client, privileged, and I wouldn't know what they wanted. You would have to ask these defense attorneys about that.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] We also reject the assertion that the method of selecting veniremen in Talladega County, with its lower proportion of Negroes on the venire list, when considered with the system of peremptory strikes establishes a prima facie case of discrimination. Absent a showing of purposeful exclusion of Negroes in the selection of veniremen, which has not been made, the lower proportion of Negroes on the venire list sheds no light whatsoever on the validity of the peremptory strike system or on whether the prosecutor systematically strikes Negroes in the county. Moreover, the constitutional issue in regard to the prosecutor's systematic use of strikes against Negroes remains much the same whatever the number of Negroes on the venire list.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nIn 1880 this Court, in Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303\n, one of the first cases applying the Fourteenth Amendment to racial discrimination, held that under the Equal Protection Clause, a State cannot systematically exclude persons from juries solely because of their race or color. Since Strauder and until today this Court has consistently applied this constitutional principle. See Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 339\n; Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565\n; Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442\n; Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226\n; Martin v. Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316\n; Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n; \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 229]\n\u00a0\n Hale v. Kentucky, \n303 \nU.S. 613\n; Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354\n; Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128\n; Hill v.

Alabama, supra, at 589:\n\n  \"There is no controversy as to the constitutional  principle involved. . . . Summing up precisely the  effect of earlier decisions, this Court thus stated the  principle in Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, in  relation to exclusion from service on grand juries:  `Whenever by any action of a State, whether through  its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive  or administrative officers, all persons of the  African race are excluded, solely because of their race  or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal  prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal  protection of the laws is denied to him, contrary to  the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of  the United States. Strauder v. West Virginia,  \n100 \nU.S. 303\n; Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 397\n;  Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565\n.' This statement  was repeated in the same terms in Rogers v.  Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, and again in Martin v.  Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316, 319\n. The principle is equally  applicable to a similar exclusion of negroes from  service on petit juries. Strauder v. West Virginia,  supra; Martin v. Texas, supra. And although the  state statute defining the qualifications of jurors may  be fair on its face, the constitutional provision affords  protection against action of the State through its  administrative officers in effecting the prohibited \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 230]\n\u00a0\n  discrimination. Neal v. Delaware, supra; Carter v.  Texas, supra. Compare Virginia v. Rives, \n100 \nU.S. 313\n,  322, 323; In re Wood, \n140 \nU.S. 278, 285\n;  Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 283.\"\n\n\n This set of principles was recently and explicitly reaffirmed by this Court in Eubanks v. Louisiana, supra, and Arnold v. North Carolina, supra.\n\nThe reasons underlying the Court's decisions in these cases were well expressed in Strauder:\n\n \"The very idea of a jury is a body of men composed  of the peers or equals of the person whose rights it  is selected or summoned to determine; that is, of his  neighbors, fellows, associates, persons having the  same legal status in society as that which he holds.  Blackstone, in his Commentaries, says, `The right of  trial by jury, or the country, is a trial by the peers  of every Englishman, and is the grand bulwark of  his liberties, and is secured to him by the Great  Charter.' It is also guarded by statutory enactments  intended to make impossible what Mr. Bentham  called `packing juries.' It is well known that prejudices  often exist against particular classes in the community,  which sway the judgment of jurors, and  which, therefore, operate in some cases to deny to  persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that  protection which others enjoy.\" 100 U.S., at  308-309.\n\n\n Moreover,\n\n \"[t]he very fact that colored people are singled out  and expressly denied by a statute all right to participate  in the administration of the law, as jurors,  because of their color, though they are citizens, and  may be in other respects fully qualified, is practically  a brand upon them, affixed by the law, an assertion  of their inferiority, and a stimulant to that race \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 231]\n\u00a0\n  prejudice which is an impediment to securing to individuals  of the race that equal justice which the law  aims to secure to all others.\" \n100 \nU.S., at 308\n.\n\n\n The principles and reasoning upon which this long line of decisions rests are sound. The need for their reaffirmation is present. The United States Commission on Civil Rights in its 1961 Report, Justice 103, after exhaustive study of the practice of discrimination in jury selection, concluded that \"[t]he practice of racial exclusion from juries persists today even though it has long stood indicted as a serious violation of the 14th amendment.\" It is unthinkable, therefore, that the principles of Strauder and the cases following should be in any way weakened or undermined at this late date particularly when this Court has made it clear in other areas, where the course of decision has not been so uniform, that the States may not discriminate on the basis of race. Compare Plessy v. Ferguson, \n163 \nU.S. 537\n, with Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n; compare Pace v. Alabama, \n106 \nU.S. 583\n, with McLaughlin v. Florida, \n379 \nU.S. 184\n.\n\nRegrettably, however, the Court today while referring with approval to Strauder and the cases which have followed, seriously impairs their authority and creates additional barriers to the elimination of jury discrimination practices which have operated in many communities to nullify the command of the Equal Protection Clause. This is evident from an analysis of the Court's holding as applied to the facts which are virtually undisputed.\n\nPetitioner, a 19-year-old Negro, was indicted in Talladega County for the rape of a 17-year-old white girl, found guilty, and sentenced to death by an all-white jury. The petitioner established by competent evidence and without contradiction that not only was there no Negro on the jury that convicted and sentenced him, but also that no Negro within the memory of persons now living \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 232]\n\u00a0\n has ever served on any petit jury in any civil or criminal case tried in Talladega County, Alabama. Yet, of the group designated by Alabama as generally eligible for jury service in that county, 74% (12,125) were white and 26% (4,281) were Negro.\n\nUnder well-established principles this evidence clearly makes out \"a prima facie case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees.\" Norris v. Alabama, supra, at 591. The case here is at least as strong as that in Norris where\n\n\"proof that Negroes constituted a substantial segment of the population of the jurisdiction, that some Negroes were qualified to serve as jurors, and that none had been called for jury service over an extended period of time, was held to constitute prima facie proof of the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service. This holding, sometimes called the `rule of exclusion,' has been applied in other cases, and it is available in supplying proof of discrimination against any delineated class.\" Hernandez v. Texas, supra, at 480.\n\n\n It is also at least as strong as the case in Patton v. Mississippi, supra, where the Court stated:\n\n \"It is to be noted at once that the indisputable fact that no Negro had served on a criminal court grand or petit jury for a period of thirty years created a very strong showing that during that period Negroes were systematically excluded from jury service because of race. When such a showing was made, it became a duty of the State to try to justify such an exclusion as having been brought about for some reason other than racial discrimination.\" \n332 \nU.S., at 466\n.\n\n\n It is clear that, unless the State here can \"justify such an exclusion as having been brought about for some reason \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 233]\n\u00a0\n other than racial discrimination,\" Patton v. Mississippi, ibid., this conviction \"cannot stand.\" Id., at 469. Norris v. Alabama, supra, at 596-598; Arnold v. North Carolina, supra, at 774. \"Long continued omission of Negroes from jury service establishes a prima facie case of systematic discrimination. The burden of proof is then upon the State to refute it.\" Harper v. Mississippi, 251 Miss. 699, 707, 171 So.2d 129, 132-133.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nAlabama here does not deny that Negroes as a race are excluded from serving on juries in Talladega County. The State seeks to justify this admitted exclusion of Negroes from jury service by contending that the fact that no Negro has ever served on a petit jury in Talladega County has resulted from use of the jury-striking system, which is a form of peremptory challenge. While recognizing that no Negro has ever served on any petit jury in Talladega County, that the method of venire selection was inadequate, that the prosecutor in this case used the peremptory challenge system to exclude all Negroes as a class, and that the systematic misuse by the State of a peremptory challenge system to exclude all Negroes from all juries is prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court affirms petitioner's conviction on the ground that petitioner has \"failed to carry\" his burden of proof. The Court holds this because it believes the record is silent as to whether the State participated in this total exclusion of all Negroes in previous cases; it would require petitioner specifically to negative the possibility that total exclusion of Negroes from jury service in all other cases was produced solely by the action of defense attorneys.\n\nI cannot agree that the record is silent as to the State's involvement in the total exclusion of Negroes from jury service in Talladega County. The Alabama Supreme \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 234]\n\u00a0\n Court found that \"Negroes are commonly on trial venires but are always struck by attorneys in selecting the trial jury.\" 275 Ala. 508, 515, 156 So.2d 368, 375. In response to a question concerning the operation of the jury-striking system, the Circuit Solicitor, the state prosecuting attorney, stated:\n\n \"Sometimes, it depends on who is involved in a case. We have been very fortunate in this county, we have not had any white against black or black against white. If we have - where we have a situation arising in a case such as that, in the cases that we have had - we have had no capital felonies, but, we strike a jury different from what if it was two white men involved or two colored men.\"\n\n\n This statement, it seems to me, plainly indicates that, at the very least, the State - \"we\" - participates, in Talladega County, in employing the striking or peremptory challenge system to exclude Negroes from jury service in cases where white men are involved.\n\nAlso, the state prosecuting attorney testified as follows:\n\n\"Many times I have asked, Mr. Love for instance, I would say there are so many colored men on this jury venire, do you want to use any of them, and he would say, my client doesn't want them, or we don't see fit to use them. And then if I didn't see fit to use them, then we would take them off. We would strike them first, or take them off.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"If I am trying a case for the State, I will ask them  what is their wish, do they want them [Negro jurors],  and they will as a rule discuss it with their client, and  then they will say, we don't want them. If we are  not going to want them, if he doesn't want them, and  if I don't want them, what we do then is just take  them off. Strike them first.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 235]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n These quotations show either that the State \"many times\" abandons even the facade of the jury-striking system and agrees with the defense to remove all Negroes as a class from the jury lists even before the striking begins, or that pursuant to an agreement the State directly participates in the striking system to remove Negroes from the venire. Indeed the Court recognizes that \"[a]pparently in some cases, the prosecution agreed with the defense to remove Negroes.\" Ante, at 224-225. The Court, however, goes on to state that \"[t]he record makes clear that this was not a general practice . . . .\" Ante, at 225, n. 31. With all deference, it seems clear to me that the record statement quoted by the Court to support this conclusion, cuts against rather than in favor of the Court's statement and inference that the general practice was not to exclude Negroes by agreement between the prosecution and defense or by the State acting alone. The prosecutor, in the statement quoted by the court, denied that he had stated that Negro defendants \"generally do not want\" Negroes to serve on juries and stated that there had only \"been occasion here where that has happened.\" Ante, at 225, n. 31. Since it is undisputed that no Negro has ever served on a jury in the history of the county, and a great number of cases have involved Negroes, the only logical conclusion from the record statement that only on occasion have Negro defendants desired to exclude Negroes from jury service, is that in a good many cases Negroes have been excluded by the state prosecutor, either acting alone or as a participant in arranging agreements with the defense.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, the record shows that in one case, the only one apparently in the history of the county where the State offered Negroes an opportunity to sit on a petit jury, the state prosecutor offered a Negro accused an all-Negro jury where the case involved an alleged crime against another Negro. The offer was refused but it tends to confirm the conclusion that the State joins in systematically excluding Negroes from jury service because it objects to any mixing of Negro and white jurors and to a Negro sitting in a case in which a white man is in any way involved.\n\nFurthermore, the State concededly is responsible for the selection of the jury venire. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 205, the evidence showed that while Negroes represent 26% of the population generally available to be called for jury service in Talladega County, Negroes constituted a lesser proportion, generally estimated from 10% to 15%, of the average venire. The Alabama Supreme \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 237]\n\u00a0\n Court noted that under state law \"the jury commission is required to keep a roll containing the names of all male citizens living in the county who possess the qualifications prescribed by law and who are not exempted by law from serving on juries,\" 275 Ala., at 514, 156 So.2d, at 374, and, in fact, this had not been done in Talladega County. The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the method of jury selection in Talladega County was \"not exhaustive enough to insure the inclusion of all qualified persons,\" ibid., and this Court admits it is \"imperfect,\" ante, at 209, and that \"[v]enires drawn from the jury box made up in this manner unquestionably contained a smaller proportion of the Negro community than of the white community.\" Ante, at 208. It may be, for the reasons stated by the Court, that this \"haphazard\" method of jury selection standing alone as an alleged constitutional violation does not show unlawful jury discrimination. However, this method of venire selection cannot be viewed in isolation and must be considered in connection with the peremptory challenge system with which it is inextricably bound. When this is done it is evident that the maintenance by the State of the disproportionately low number of Negroes on jury panels enables the prosecutor, alone or in agreement with defense attorneys, to strike all Negroes from panels without materially impairing the number of peremptory challenges available for trial strategy purposes.\n\nFinally, it is clear that Negroes were removed from the venire and excluded from service by the prosecutor's use of the peremptory challenge system in this case and that they have never served on the jury in any case in the history of the county. On these facts, and the inferences reasonably drawn from them, it seems clear that petitioner has affirmatively proved a pattern of racial discrimination in which the State is significantly involved, cf. Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, \n365 \nU.S. 715, 722\n; \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 238]\n\u00a0\n Lombard v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 267\n; Peterson v. Greenville, \n373 \nU.S. 244\n, or for which the State is responsible, cf. Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461, 473\n. As this Court held in Strauder, systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service constitutes a brand of inferiority affixed upon them and state involvement in affixing such a brand is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThere is, however, a more fundamental defect in the Court's holding. Even if the Court were correct that the record is silent as to state involvement in previous cases in which Negroes have been systematically excluded from jury service, nevertheless, it is undisputed that no Negro has ever served on any petit jury in the history of Talladega County. Under Norris, Patton and the other cases discussed above, it is clear that petitioner by proving this made out a prima facie case of unlawful jury exclusion. The burden of proof then shifted to the State to prove, if it could, that this exclusion was brought about for some reason other than racial discrimination in which the State participated.\n\nThis established principle is well illustrated by the recent decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court, Harper v. Mississippi, supra, in which that court rejected an argument of the State of Mississippi strikingly similar to the one advanced here by the State of Alabama and accepted by this Court. In the Mississippi case a Negro defendant made out a prima facie case of jury exclusion by showing that only a token number of Negroes had served on juries in the county in question. The State attempted to rebut this prima facie case by contending that the exclusion resulted from a perfectly neutral system of employing voting registration lists to select prospective jurors and the fact that the number of Negroes selected was in proportion to their number on the voting registration lists. The Mississippi Supreme Court held, however, that this did not rebut the prima facie case of jury exclusion unless \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 239]\n\u00a0\n the State could additionally prove that the disproportionately low number of Negroes on the voting registration list was caused by factors other than state-involved racial discrimination. Similarly, in the instant case, it seems to me indisputable that Alabama did not rebut petitioner's prima facie case, which here is based on a showing of total exclusion, by the contention that it is the result of a neutral peremptory challenge system unless the State additionally proved that the peremptory challenge system is not being used in a way constituting state-involved discrimination. That it did not do so is uncontested.\n\nDespite the fact that the petitioner therefore has made out what is, under the settled decisions of this Court, a prima facie case of jury exclusion which the State has not rebutted, the Court today affirms petitioner's conviction because, according to the Court, petitioner has \"failed to carry\" his burden of proof. Ante, at 226. The Court concedes that if this case involved exclusion of Negroes from jury panels, under Norris and Patton a prima facie case of unconstitutional jury exclusion would be made out. However, the Court argues that because this case involves exclusion from the jury itself and not from the jury venire, the burden of proof on a defendant should be greater. This distinction is novel to say the least.\n\nThe Court's jury decisions, read together, have never distinguished between exclusion from the jury panel and exclusion from the jury itself. Indeed, no such distinction can be drawn. The very point of all these cases is to prevent that deliberate and systematic discrimination against Negroes or any other racial group that would prevent them, not merely from being placed upon the panel, but from serving on the jury. The Court quotes from Hernandez v. Texas, supra, to show that the prima facie rule applies only where no Negro \"had been called for jury service,\" ante, at 226, but such a view is rejected by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 240]\n\u00a0\n Patton's statement of the rule, for Patton held that a prima facie case was made out when it was shown that \"no Negro had served on a criminal court grand or petit jury for a period of thirty years.\" \n332 \nU.S., at 466\n. (Emphasis added.) And, Patton is confirmed by our very recent cases, Eubanks v. Louisiana, supra, and Arnold v. North Carolina, supra, which also speak only in terms of jury \"service\" and jury \"duty.\" \"The exclusion of otherwise eligible persons from jury service solely because of their ancestry or national origin is discrimination prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Hernandez v. Texas, supra, at 479. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe rule of exclusion set forth in these cases is a highly pragmatic one. It is designed to operate in jury cases so that once the defendant has made a showing of total exclusion, the burden of going forward with the evidence is placed upon the State, the party in the better position to develop the facts as to how the exclusion came about. The defendant is a party to one proceeding only, and his access to relevant evidence is obviously limited. The State is a party to all criminal cases and has greater access to the evidence, if any, which would tend to negative the State's involvement in discriminatory jury selection. The burden of proof rule developed in Norris, Patton, and other cases, which until today the Court has uniformly applied, is a simple and workable one designed to effectuate the Constitution's command. This is demonstrated by our past cases, as well as state cases.\n3\n Because the same factors - availability of evidence, simplicity, and workability - exist whether exclusion from the jury panel or exclusion from the jury itself is involved, to apply the prima facie rule of Norris and Patton to this case is neither \"blind\" nor \"wooden,\" but is realistic and sensible. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 241]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI agree with the Court that it is a reasonable inference that the State is involved in unconstitutional discrimination where total exclusion of Negroes from all venires is established. I believe that it is also a reasonable inference that the State is involved where, although some Negroes are on venires, none has ever served on a jury, cf. Eubanks v. Louisiana, supra; Arnold v. North Carolina, supra, and the State in the case at bar has excluded from jury service the Negroes on the venire by exercise of its peremptory challenges. The Court in Patton and in other cases rejected the State's argument, and held that it would be unreasonable to assume where Negroes were totally excluded from venires that this came about because all Negroes were unqualified, unwilling, or unable to serve. It would be similarly unreasonable to assume where total exclusion from service has been established and the prosecutor has used peremptory challenges to exclude all Negroes from the jury in the given case that in all previous cases Negroes were excluded solely by defense attorneys without any state involvement. If the instant case is really a unique case, as the Court implies, surely the burden of proof should be on the State to show it.\n\nFinally, the Court's reasoning on this point completely overlooks the fact that the total exclusion of Negroes from juries in Talladega County results from the interlocking of an inadequate venire selection system, for which the State concededly is responsible, and the use of peremptory challenges. All of these factors confirm my view that no good reason exists to fashion a new rule of burden of proof, which will make it more difficult to put an end to discriminatory selection of juries on racial grounds and will thereby impair the constitutional promise of \"Equal Protection of the Laws,\" made effective by Strauder and the cases which follow it. By undermining the doctrine of the prima facie case while paying lip service to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 242]\n\u00a0\n Strauder the Court today allies itself with those \"that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope.\"\n\nThe Court departs from the long-established burden of proof rule in this area, and imposes substantial additional burdens upon Negro defendants such as petitioner because of its view of the importance of retaining inviolate the right of the State to use peremptory challenges. I believe, however, that the preference granted by the Court to the State's use of the peremptory challenge is both unwarranted and unnecessary.\n\nTo begin with, the peremptory challenge has long been recognized primarily as a device to protect defendants. As stated by Blackstone in a passage quoted with approval by this Court:\n\n\"[I]n criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is, in favorem vitae, allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all; which is called a peremptory challenge: a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners, for which our English laws are justly famous. This is grounded on two reasons.\n\n\n \"1. As every one must be sensible, what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another; and how necessary it is, that a prisoner (when put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him; the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike.\n\n\n \"2. Because, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 243]\n\u00a0\n may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\" 4 Bl. Comm. 353.\n\n\n Quoted with approval in Lewis v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 370, 376\n; see also United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat. 480. 482.\n\nIndeed in England, as the Court points out, ante, at 212-213, although the Crown at early common law had an unlimited number of peremptory challenges, as early as 1305 that right was taken away, and since that time in England peremptories may be exercised only by the defendant. Orfield, Criminal Procedure From Arrest to Appeal 355 (1947). Harris, Criminal Law 443 (20th ed. 1960).\n4\n It appears that in modern times peremptories are rarely used in England, even by defendants. Ibid.\n\nWhile peremptory challenges are commonly used in this country both by the prosecution and by the defense, we have long recognized that the right to challenge peremptorily is not a fundamental right, constitutionally guaranteed, even as applied to a defendant, much less to the State. Stilson v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 583\n. This Court has sanctioned numerous incursions upon the right to challenge peremptorily. Defendants may be tried together even though the exercise by one of his right to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 244]\n\u00a0\n challenge peremptorily may deprive his codefendant of a juror he desires or may require that codefendant to use his challenges in a way other than he wishes. United States v. Marchant, supra. A defendant may be required to exercise his challenges prior to the State, so that some may be wasted on jurors whom the State would have challenged. Pointer v. United States, \n151 \nU.S. 396\n. Congress may regulate the number of peremptory challenges available to defendants by statute and may require codefendants to be treated as a single defendant so that each has only a small portion of the number of peremptories he would have if tried separately. Stilson v. United States, supra. In Stilson this Court stated, \"There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges to defendants in criminal cases; trial by an impartial jury is all that is secured.\" \n250 \nU.S., at 586\n. The Fourteenth Amendment would impose no greater obligation upon the States. Today this Court reverses Stilson's maxim, in effect holding that \"There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the State to grant trial by an impartial jury so long as the inviolability of the peremptory challenge is secured.\"\n\nWere it necessary to make an absolute choice between the right of a defendant to have a jury chosen in conformity with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the right to challenge peremptorily, the Constitution compels a choice of the former. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, settled beyond doubt that when a constitutional claim is opposed by a nonconstitutional one, the former must prevail. But no such choice is compelled in this situation. The holding called for by this case, is that where, as here, a Negro defendant proves that Negroes constitute a substantial segment of the population, that Negroes are qualified to serve as jurors, and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 245]\n\u00a0\n that none or only a token number\n5\n has served on juries over an extended period of time, a prima facie case of the exclusion of Negroes from juries is then made out; that the State, under our settled decisions, is then called upon to show that such exclusion has been brought about \"for some reason other than racial discrimination,\" Patton v. Mississippi, supra, at 466; and that the State wholly fails to meet the prima facie case of systematic and purposeful racial discrimination by showing that it has been accomplished by the use of a peremptory challenge system unless the State also shows that it is not involved in the misuse of such a system to prevent all Negroes from ever sitting on any jury. Such a holding would not interfere with the rights of defendants to use peremptories, nor the right of the State to use peremptories as they normally and traditionally have been used.\n\nIt would not mean, as the Court's prior decisions, to which I would adhere, make clear, that Negroes are entitled to proportionate representation on a jury. Cassell v. Texas, supra, at 286-287 (opinion of Mr. Justice Reed). Nor would it mean that where systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service has not been shown, a prosecutor's motives are subject to question or judicial inquiry when he excludes Negroes or any other group from sitting on a jury in a particular case. Only where systematic exclusion has been shown, would the State be called upon to justify its use of peremptories or to negative the State's involvement in discriminatory jury selection.\n\nThis holding would mean, however, that a conviction cannot stand where, as here, a Negro defendant, by showing widespread systematic exclusion, makes out a prima facie case of unconstitutional discrimination which the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 246]\n\u00a0\n State does not rebut. Drawing the line in this fashion, in my view, achieves a practical accommodation of the constitutional right and the operation of the peremptory challenge system without doing violence to either.\n\nI deplore the Court's departure from its holdings in Strauder and Norris. By affirming petitioner's conviction on this clear record of jury exclusion because of race, the Court condones the highly discriminatory procedures used in Talladega County under which Negroes never have served on any petit jury in that county. By adding to the present heavy burden of proof required of defendants in these cases, the Court creates additional barriers to the elimination of practices which have operated in many communities throughout the Nation to nullify the command of the Equal Protection Clause in this important area in the administration of justice. See 1961 United States Commission on Civil Rights Report, Justice 81-103.\n\nI would be faithful to the teachings of this Court in its prior jury exclusion cases and the view, repeatedly expressed by this Court, that distinctions between citizens solely because of their race, religion, or ancestry, are odious to the Fourteenth Amendment. I would reaffirm and apply here what this Court said in Smith v. Texas, supra, at 130:\n\n \"It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community. For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government. . . . The fact that the written words of a state's laws hold out a promise that no such discrimination \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 247]\n\u00a0\n will be practiced is not enough. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that equal protection to all must be given - not merely promised.\"\n\n\n Applying these principles, I would reverse. This, of course, would \"not mean that a guilty defendant must go free.\" Patton v. Mississippi, supra, at 469; see Hill v. Texas, supra, at 406. For, as the Court pointed out in Patton v. Mississippi, supra, at 469, the State, if it so desired, could retry petitioner by a jury \"selected as the Constitution commands.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See also State v. Lowry, 263 N.C. 536, 139 S. E. 2d 870.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] I believe that the record shows that agreement between the State and the defense to exclude Negroes has occurred \"many times.\" The Court itself admits that at least \"in some cases, the prosecution agreed with the defense to remove Negroes.\" Ante, at 224-225. It concludes, however, that this is not sufficient on the ground that \"[t]here is no evidence, however, of what the prosecution did or did not do on its own account in any cases other than the one at bar.\" Ibid. (Emphasis \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 236]\n\u00a0\n added.) This Court, however, has never held in any case involving racial discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment that such discrimination is unconstitutional only if it is brought about by the State acting alone. The test which has been applied is whether the State \"to some significant extent . . . has been . . . involved.\" Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, \n365 \nU.S. 715, 722\n. See Peterson v. Greenville, \n373 \nU.S. 244\n; Lombard v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 267\n. \"The vital requirement is State responsibility - that somewhere, somehow, to some extent, there be an infusion of conduct by officials, panoplied with State power, into any scheme by which colored citizens are denied . . . rights merely because they are colored.\" Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461, 473\n (separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). The State's agreement with the defense, which the record establishes, to remove Negroes from jury venires, under the Court's settled decisions meets the \"state action\" requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the principles of Strauder and the cases following, it constitutes \"action of a State . . . through its . . . administrative officers\" excluding persons \"solely because of their race or color\" from serving on juries. Carter v. Texas, supra, at 447.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Harper v. Mississippi, supra; State v. Lowry, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Crown's right to challenge peremptorily was removed in that year by 33 Edw. 1, Stat. 4, because the King's right to challenge without showing cause \"was mischievous to the subject, tending to infinite delayes and danger.\" Coke on Littleton 156 (14th ed. 1791). Since 33 Edw. 1, Stat. 4, the Crown can only require jurors whom it wishes to challenge to stand aside from the panel until the defendant has exercised all his challenges. Then, if a jury has not been selected, the jurors, who have been \"stood aside\" will be used unless the Crown can challenge them for cause. Orfield, supra, at 356, Harris, supra, at 443, III Bacon's Abridgment 764 (5th ed. 1798). Even this limited procedure as the Court notes, ante, at 213, n. 12, however, is rarely used today. Orfield, supra, at 355; Harris, supra, at 443.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Cassell v. Texas, supra; Harper v. Mississippi, supra. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 202, 248]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWIFT & CO. v. WICKHAM(1965)\nNo. 13245\nArgued: October 13, 1965Decided: November 22, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appellants, two meat-packing companies, sued in the Federal District Court to enjoin enforcement of a New York statute requiring that the label for packaged poultry disclose the weight of the unstuffed bird as well as of the entire package. Appellants claimed that the state statute violated the Commerce Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, and overriding federal labeling requirements under which the state label had been disapproved. A three-judge District Court was convened under 28 U.S.C. 2281, providing for such a tribunal whenever the enforcement of a state statute is sought to be enjoined \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.\" That court dismissed on the merits in both its single-judge and three-judge capacities, and appeals were taken respectively to the Court of Appeals and (under 28 U.S.C. 1253) to this Court. Held: The three-judge court requirement applies to injunction suits depending directly upon a substantive provision of the Constitution and does not apply to Supremacy Clause cases involving only federal-state statutory conflicts. Pp. 114-129.\n\n (a) Appellants' Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment claims are too insubstantial to support three-judge court jurisdiction. Pp. 114-115.\n\n\n (b) A claim that a state statute is pre-empted by or in conflict with a federal provision though grounded in the Supremacy Clause primarily involves the comparison of two statutes, rather than the interpretation of the Constitution; therefore, as established in Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n; Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n; and Case v.

Department of Public Safety, \n369 \nU.S. 153\n, that a three-judge court is required if the constitutional issue is \"immediately\" apparent but not if substantial statutory \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n construction is required, is unworkable, and that decision is pro tanto overruled.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellants, the Swift and Armour Companies, stuff, freeze, and package turkeys which they ship to retailers throughout the country for ultimate sale to consumers. Each package is labeled with the net weight of the particular bird (including stuffing) in conformity with a governing federal statute, the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 441, 21 U.S.C. 451-469 (1964 ed.), and the regulations issued under its authority by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n1\n Many of these turkeys are \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n sold in New York. Section 193 of New York's Agriculture and Markets Law\n2\n has been interpreted through regulations and rulings to require that these packaged turkeys be sold with labels informing the public of the weight of the unstuffed bird as well as of the entire package. Because the amount of stuffing varies with each bird, the State thus seeks to help purchasers ascertain just how much fowl is included in each ready-for-the-oven turkey.\n\nSwift and Armour requested permission of the Poultry Products Section of the Department of Agriculture to change their labels in order to conform with New York's requirements, but such permission was refused at the initial administrative level and no administrative review of that refusal was sought. Swift and Armour \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n then brought this federal action to enjoin the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of New York from enforcing the State's labeling provisions, asserting that enforcement would violate the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and overriding requirements of the federal poultry enactment.\n\nPursuant to appellants' request, a three-judge district court was constituted under 28 U.S.C. 2281 (1958 ed.), which provides for such a tribunal whenever the enforcement of a state statute is sought to be enjoined \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.\" The District Court, unsure of its jurisdiction for reasons appearing below, dismissed the suit on the merits\n3\n acting both in a three-judge and single-judge capacity.\n4\n Appeals were lodged in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the single-judge determination, and in this Court from the three-judge decision in accordance with the direct appeal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1253 (1964 ed.). The threshold question before us, the consideration of which we postponed to the merits (\n379 \nU.S. 997\n), is whether this Court, rather than the Court of Appeals, has jurisdiction to review the District Court determination, and this in turn depends on whether a three-judge court was required. We hold that it was not.\n\nAt the outset, we agree with the District Court that the Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n claims alleged in the complaint are too insubstantial to support the jurisdiction of a three-judge court. It has long been held that no such court is called for when the alleged constitutional claim is insubstantial, Ex parte Poresky, \n290 \nU.S. 30\n; California Water Service Co. v. City of Redding, \n304 \nU.S. 252\n. Since the only remaining basis put forth for enjoining enforcement of the state enactment was its asserted repugnancy to the federal statute, the District Court was quite right in concluding that the question of a three-judge court turned on the proper application of our 1962 decision in Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, \n369 \nU.S. 153\n. There we decided that in suits to restrain the enforcement of a state statute allegedly in conflict with or in a field pre-empted by a federal statute, 2281 comes into play only when the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution is immediately drawn in question, but not when issues of federal or state statutory construction must first be decided even though the Supremacy Clause may ultimately be implicated. Finding itself unable to say with assurance whether its resolution of the merits of this case involved less statutory construction than had taken place in Kesler, the District Court was left with the puzzling question how much more statutory construction than occurred in Kesler is necessary to deprive three judges of their jurisdiction.\n\nIt might suffice to dispose of the three-judge court issue for us to hold, in agreement with what the District Court indicated, 230 F. Supp., at 410, that this case involves so much more statutory construction than did Kesler that a three-judge court was inappropriate. (We would indeed find it difficult to say that less or no more statutory construction was involved here than in Kesler and that therefore under that decision a three-judge court was necessary.) We think, however, that such a disposition of this important jurisdictional question would be \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n less than satisfactory, that candor compels us to say that we find the application of the Kesler rule as elusive as did the District Court, and that we would fall short in our responsibilities if we did not accept this opportunity to take a fresh look at the problem. We believe that considerations of stare decisis should not deter us from this course. Unless inexorably commanded by statute, a procedural principle of this importance should not be kept on the books in the name of stare decisis once it is proved to be unworkable in practice; the mischievous consequences to litigants and courts alike from the perpetuation of an unworkable rule are too great. For reasons given in this opinion, we have concluded that the Kesler doctrine in this area of 2281 is unsatisfactory, and that Kesler should be pro tanto overruled. The overruling of a six-to-two decision\n5\n of such recent vintage, which was concurred in by two members of the majority in the present case,\n6\n and the opinion in support of which was written by an acknowledged expert in the field of federal jurisdiction, demands full explication of our reasons.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe three-judge district court is a unique feature of our jurisprudence, created to alleviate a specific discontent within the federal system. The antecedent of 2281 was a 1910 Act\n7\n passed to assuage growing popular displeasure with the frequent grants of injunctions by federal courts against the operation of state legislation regulating railroads and utilities in particular.\n8\n The \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n federal courts of the early nineteenth century had occasionally issued injunctions at the behest of private litigants against state officials to prevent the enforcement of state statutes,\n9\n but such cases were rare and generally of a character that did not offend important state policies. The advent of the Granger and labor movements in the late nineteenth century,\n10\n and the acceleration of state social legislation especially through the creation of regulatory bodies met with opposition in the federal judiciary. In Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, this Court held that the setting of rates not permitting a fair return violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, established firmly the corollary that inferior federal courts could enjoin state officials from enforcing such unconstitutional state laws.\n\nThis confrontation between the uncertain contours of the Due Process Clause and developing state regulatory \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n legislation, arising in district courts that were generally considered unsympathetic to the policies of the States, had severe repercussions. Efforts were made in Congress to limit in various ways the jurisdiction of federal courts in these sensitive areas.\n11\n State officials spoke out against the obstruction and delay occasioned by these federal injunction suits.\n12\n The sponsor of the bill establishing the three-judge procedure for these cases, Senator Overman of North Carolina, noted:\n\n\"[T]here are 150 cases of this kind now where one federal judge has tied the hands of the state officers, the governor, and the attorney-general . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .   .\n\n\nWhenever one judge stands up in a State and enjoins the governor and the attorney-general, the people resent it, and public sentiment is stirred, as it was in my State, when there was almost a rebellion, whereas if three judges declare that a state statute is unconstitutional the people would rest easy under it.\" 45 Cong. Rec. 7256.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In such an atmosphere was this three-judge court procedure put on the statute books, and although subsequent Congresses have amended the statute\n14\n its basic structure remains intact.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSection 2281 was designed to provide a more responsible forum for the litigation of suits which, if successful, would render void state statutes embodying important state policies. The statute provides for notification to the State of a pending suit, 28 U.S.C. 2284 (2) (1964 ed.), thus preventing ex parte injunctions common previously.\n15\n It provides for three judges, one of whom must be a circuit judge, 28 U.S.C. 2284 (1) (1964 ed.), to allow a more authoritative determination and less opportunity for individual predilection in sensitive and politically emotional areas. It authorizes direct review by this Court, 28 U.S.C. 1253, as a means of accelerating a final determination on the merits; an important criticism of the pre-1910 procedure was directed at the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n length of time required to appeal through the circuit courts to the Supreme Court, and the consequent disruption of state tax and regulatory programs caused by the outstanding injunction.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThat this procedure must be used in any suit for an injunction against state officials on the ground that a state enactment is unconstitutional has been clear from the start. What yet remains unclear, in spite of decisions by this and other courts, is the scope of the phrase \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute\" when the complaint alleges not the traditional Due Process Clause, Equal Protection Clause, Commerce Clause, or Contract Clause arguments, but rather that the state statute or regulation in question is pre-empted by or in conflict with some federal statute or regulation thereunder. Any such pre-emption or conflict claim is of course grounded in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution: if a state measure conflicts with a federal requirement, the state provision must give way. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1. The basic question involved in these cases, however, is never one of interpretation of the Federal Constitution but inevitably one of comparing two statutes. Whether one district judge or three must carry out this function is the question at hand.\n\nThe first decision of this Court casting light on the problem was Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, in which the question presented was, as here, whether an appeal was properly taken directly from the District Court to the Supreme Court. At issue was whether a Missouri statute authorizing taxation of bank shares remained valid after the enactment of a federal statute which enlarged the scope of the States' power to tax national banks by permitting taxation of shares, or dividends, or \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 121]\n\u00a0\n income. Under the federal scheme, States were apparently expected to choose one of the three methods. Although the Missouri law applied the first basis of assessment, the District Court held that because the State did not explicitly choose among the three types of taxation, but instead relied on a prior statute, the assessment was void. Mr. Justice Brandeis, writing for a unanimous Court, held that this was not properly a three-judge court case \". . . because no state statute was assailed as being repugnant to the Federal Constitution.\" \n271 \nU.S., at 465\n. Although the complaint in Buder did not explicitly invoke the Supremacy Clause, it should be noted that the defendants' answer asserted that if the federal statute was constitutional under the Tenth Amendment, then it would indeed be the \"`supreme law of the land' within the meaning and provisions of Article VI of the Constitution of the United States,\" and thus controlling over the particular state statute unless that statute could be construed as consistent with the federal law. The District Court in Buder was thus clearly presented with the Supremacy Clause basis of the statutory conflict.\n\nEx parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n, raised a similar problem, also in the context of the validity of a state tax. The Court again held this type of federal-state confrontation outside the purview of the predecessor of 2281:\n\n\"If such assessments are invalid, it is because they levy taxes upon property withdrawn from taxation by federal law or in a manner forbidden by the National Banking Act. The declaration of the supremacy clause gives superiority to valid federal acts over conflicting state statutes but this superiority for present purposes involves merely the construction of an act of Congress, not the constitutionality of the state enactment.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 358\n-359. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In a third case, Case v. Bowles, \n327 \nU.S. 92\n, the question involved the proposed sale by the State of Washington of timber on state-owned land at a price violating the Federal Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. A federal district court enjoined the sale, and on appeal the State argued that the single judge lacked jurisdiction. This Court held otherwise: \"the complaint did not challenge the constitutionality of the state statute but alleged merely that its enforcement would violate the Emergency Price Control Act. Consequently a three-judge court is not required.\" \n327 \nU.S., at 97\n.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nThe upshot of these decisions seems abundantly clear: Supremacy Clause cases are not within the purview of 2281.\n18\n This distinction between cases involving claims \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 123]\n\u00a0\n that state statutes are unconstitutional within the scope of 2281 and cases involving statutory pre-emption or conflict remained firm until Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, \n369 \nU.S. 153\n, in which the plaintiff alleged a conflict between the federal bankruptcy laws and a state statute suspending the driving licenses of persons who are judgment debtors as a result of an adverse decision in an action involving the negligent operation of an automobile. It was argued that federal policy underlying the bankruptcy law overrode the State's otherwise legitimate exercise of its police power. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, for a majority, declared first that 2281 made no distinction between the Supremacy Clause and other provisions of the Constitution as a ground for denying enforcement of a state statute, and second that Buder, Bransford, and Case could be distinguished on the ground that they presented no claims of unconstitutionality as such: \"If in immediate controversy is not the unconstitutionality of a state law but merely the construction of a state law or the federal law, the three-judge requirement does not become operative.\" \n369 \nU.S., at 157\n. In the Kesler case itself, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, there was no problem of statutory construction but only a \"constitutional question\" whether the state enactment was pre-empted. After what can only be characterized as extensive statutory analysis (\n369 \nU.S., at 158\n-174) the majority concluded that there had in fact been no pre-emption.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIn re-examining the Kesler rule the admonition that 2281 is to be viewed \"not as a measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such,\" Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246, 251\n, should be kept in mind. The Kesler opinion itself reflects this admonition, for its rationalization of Buder, Bransford, and Case as being consistent with the view that Supremacy Clause cases are not excluded from \"the comprehensive language of 2281,\" \n369 \nU.S., at 156\n, is otherwise most difficult to explain.\n\nAs a procedural rule governing the distribution of judicial responsibility the test for applying 2281 must be clearly formulated. The purpose of the three-judge scheme was in major part to expedite important litigation: it should not be interpreted in such a way that litigation, like the present one, is delayed while the proper composition of the tribunal is litigated. We are now convinced that the Kesler rule, distinguishing between cases in which substantial statutory construction is required and those in which the constitutional issue is \"immediately\" apparent, is in practice unworkable. Not only has it been uniformly criticized by commentators,\n20\n but lower courts have quite evidently sought to avoid dealing with its application\n21\n or have interpreted it with uncertainty.\n22\n As Judge Friendly's opinion for the court below demonstrates, in order to ascertain the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 125]\n\u00a0\n correct forum, the merits must first be adjudicated in order to discover whether the court has \"engaged in so much more construction than in Kesler as to make that ruling inapplicable.\" 230 F. Supp., at 410. Such a formulation, whatever its abstract justification, cannot stand as an every-day test for allocating litigation between district courts of one and three judges.\n\nTwo possible interpretations of 2281 would provide a more practicable rule for three-judge court jurisdiction. The first is that Kesler might be extended to hold, as some of its language might be thought to indicate,\n23\n that all suits to enjoin the enforcement of a state statute, whatever the federal ground, must be channeled through three-judge courts. The second is that no such suits resting solely on \"supremacy\" grounds fall within the statute.\n\nThe first alternative holds some attraction. First, it is relatively straightforward: a court need not distinguish among different constitutional grounds for the requested injunction; it need look only at the relief sought. Moreover, in those cases, as in that before us, in which an injunction is sought on several grounds, the proper forum would not depend on whether certain alleged constitutional grounds turn out to be insubstantial. Second, 2281 speaks of \"unconstitutionality,\" and, to be sure, any determination that a state statute is void for obstructing a federal statute does rest on the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution. And, third, there is some policy justification for a wider rule. In a broad sense, what concerned the legislators who passed the progenitor of 2281 was the voiding of state legislation by inferior federal courts. The sensibilities of the citizens, and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 126]\n\u00a0\n perhaps more particularly of the state officials, were less likely to be offended, the Congress thought, by a judgment considered and handed down by three judges rather than by one judge. This rationale can be thought to be as applicable to a suit voiding state legislation on grounds of conflict with a federal statute as it is to an identical suit alleging a conflict with the Federal Constitution directly.\n\nPersuasive as these considerations may be, we believe that the reasons supporting the second interpretation, that is, returning to the traditional Buder-Bransford-Case rule, should carry the day. This restrictive view of the application of 2281 is more consistent with a discriminating reading of the statute itself than is the first and more embracing interpretation. The statute requires a three-judge court in order to restrain the enforcement of a state statute \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.\" Since all federal actions to enjoin a state enactment rest ultimately on the Supremacy Clause,\n24\n the words \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute\" would appear to be superfluous unless they are read to exclude some types of such injunctive suits.\n25\n For a simple provision prohibiting the restraint of the enforcement of any state statute except by a three-judge court would manifestly have sufficed to embrace every such suit whatever its particular constitutional ground. It is thus quite permissible to read \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 127]\n\u00a0\n the phrase in question as one of limitation, signifying a congressional purpose to confine the three-judge court requirement to injunction suits depending directly upon a substantive provision of the Constitution, leaving cases of conflict with a federal statute (or treaty) to follow their normal course in a single-judge court. We do not suggest that this reading of 2281 is compelled. We do say, however, that it is an entirely appropriate reading, and one that is supported by all the precedents in this Court until Kesler and by sound policy considerations.\n\nAn examination of the origins of the three-judge procedure does not suggest what the legislators would have thought about this particular problem, but it does show quite clearly what sort of cases were of concern to them. Their ire was aroused by the frequent grants of injunctions against the enforcement of progressive state regulatory legislation, usually on substantive due process grounds. (See pp. 116-119, supra.) Requiring the collective judgment of three judges and accelerating appeals to this Court were designed to safeguard important state interests. In contrast, a case involving an alleged incompatibility between state and federal statutes, such as the litigation before us, involves more confining legal analysis and can hardly be thought to raise the worrisome possibilities that economic or political predilections will find their way into a judgment. Moreover, those who enacted the three-judge court statute should not be deemed to have been insensitive to the circumstance that single-judge decisions in conflict and pre-emption cases were always subject to the corrective power of Congress, whereas a \"constitutional\" decision by such a judge would be beyond that ready means of correction and could be dealt with only by constitutional amendment. The purpose of 2281 to provide greater restraint and dignity at the district court level cannot well be thought generally applicable to cases that involve conflicts \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 128]\n\u00a0\n between state and federal statutes, in this instance determining whether the Department of Agriculture's regulations as applied to the labeling of total net weight on frozen stuffed turkeys necessarily renders invalid a New York statute requiring a supplemental net weight figure which excludes the stuffing.\n\nOur decision that three-judge courts are not required in Supremacy Clause cases involving only federal-state statutory conflicts, in addition to being most consistent with the statute's structure, with pre-Kesler precedent, and with the section's historical purpose, is buttressed by important considerations of judicial administration. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed in Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, \n362 \nU.S. 73, 92\n-93 (dissenting opinion):\n\n\"[T]he convening of a three-judge trial court makes for dislocation of the normal structure and functioning of the lower federal courts, particularly in the vast non-metropolitan regions; and direct review of District Court judgments by this Court not only expands this Court's obligatory jurisdiction but contradicts the dominant principle of having this Court review decisions only after they have gone through two judicial sieves . . . .\"\n\n\n Although the number of three-judge determinations each year should not be exaggerated,\n26\n this Court's concern for efficient operation of the lower federal courts persuades us to return to the Buder-Bransford-Case rule, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 129]\n\u00a0\n thereby conforming with the constrictive view of the three-judge jurisdiction which this Court has traditionally taken. Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565\n; Oklahoma Gas & Elec. Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386\n; Rorick v. Board of Commissioners, \n307 \nU.S. 208\n; Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246\n.\n\nWe hold therefore that this appeal is not properly before us under 28 U.S.C. 1253 and that appellate review lies in the Court of Appeals, where appellants' alternative appeal is now pending. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 457 (b) declares:\n\n\"The use of any written, printed or graphic matter upon or accompanying any poultry product inspected or required to be \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n inspected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or the container thereof which is false or misleading in any particular is prohibited.\"\n\n\n Section 458 (d) prohibits \"Using in commerce, or in a designated major consuming area, a false or misleading label on any poultry product.\"\n\nThe Secretary of Agriculture is authorized by 463 to issue regulations. 7 CFR 81.125 requires containers to bear \"approved labels\"; 81.130 (a) (3) declares that labels must include the net weight of the contents and that \"The net weight marked on containers of poultry products shall be the net weight of the poultry products and shall not include the weights of the wet or dry packaging materials and giblet wrapping materials.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 193-3 provides:\n\n\"All food and food products offered for sale at retail and not in containers shall be sold or offered for sale by net weight, standard measure or numerical count under such regulations as may be prescribed by the commissioner.\"\n\n\n Net weight was not defined in the regulation, 1 NYCRR 221.40 (now 221.9 (c)), but \"[t]he Director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Department testified that he interpreted the regulation, as applied to stuffed turkeys, to require statement of the net weight both of the unstuffed and of the stuffed bird, and that, when asked, he so advised local sealers of weights and measures.\" Swift & Co. v.

Supp. 398, 401 (1964).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The court below rejected appellants' Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment arguments, held that there had been no federal pre-emption of this field of regulation, and, though implying strongly that the New York labeling requirements did not conflict with federal requirements, held that this question should first be passed upon at a higher federal administrative level.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The three-judge court dismissed the complaint \"certifying out of abundant caution\" that the original district judge, also a member of the three-judge panel, \"individually arrived at the same conclusion.\" 230 F.

L. Rev. 379, 417 and n. 176 (1930).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Senator Overman was probably referring to Southern R. Co. v. McNeill, 155 F. 756 (1907). There, after an injunction had been sustained by the Circuit Court, the Governor publicly urged state officials to ignore it. The railway complained to the Court that \"these attacks on the part of the Governor and state officials against the company and its agents . . . had the effect of demoralizing the servants, agents, and employes of the company to such an extent as to render it well nigh impossible for complainant to properly discharge the duties which it owed the public . . . .\" Id., at 790-791.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The procedure was extended to cover challenges to orders of state administrative commissions in 1913, 37 Stat. 1013, 28 U.S.C. 2281, and in 1925 suits for permanent injunctions were brought within its purview, 43 Stat. 938, 28 U.S.C. 2281. Three-judge district courts are also required in certain suits arising under federal law. See Note, The Three-Judge District Court: Scope and Procedure Under Section 2281, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 299, 300-301 and n. 19 (1963).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See Hutcheson, supra, at 800-801. Senator Crawford of South Dakota told the Congress that when his State Legislature was debating a maximum rate law, the railway companies had already prepared motions for injunctions:\n\n\"The statute passed and was presented to the governor for his signature, and in less than an hour after he had signed the bill and it was filed in the office of the secretary of state a restraining order came by telegraph from a United States judge, enjoining the governor and the attorney-general and all the officers in the State from proceeding to enforce that statute.\" 45 Cong. Rec. 7252 (1910).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See, id., at 7256 (remarks of Senator Crawford); note 12, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] This basic rule has been reiterated in other familiar cases where the facts did not require its application. See Query v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 486\n, where, however, a three-judge court was found necessary because other not insubstantial constitutional claims had been clearly asserted. In Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, \n362 \nU.S. 73\n, the majority held that if a state statute is sought to be enjoined on constitutional grounds (Commerce Clause, Equal Protection) it did not matter that a \"nonconstitutional\" ground (pre-emption by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act) was also asserted. Mr. Justice Frankfurter dissented, reasoning that the three-judge procedure should be read narrowly and that the mere availability of a \"non-constitutional\" basis for enjoining the state statute should give jurisdiction to a single judge. Both majority and dissent assumed that an attack upon a state enactment on the ground that it was inconsistent with a federal statute was such a \"non-constitutional\" ground.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] None of these cases can be read to suggest that the result depends on whether or not the complaint specifically invokes the Supremacy Clause, for that clause is the inevitable underpinning for the striking down of a state enactment which is inconsistent with federal law. See the quotation from Bransford, supra, p. 121, a case in which the Supremacy Clause was not invoked in the complaint. See also the discussion of Ex parte Buder, supra, pp. 120-121. Nor do any \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 123]\n\u00a0\n of these cases suggest that the issue turns on the amount of statutory construction involved, whether large, small, or simply of the character that entails laying the alleged conflicting statutes side by side.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] In dissent it was stated that the Kesler opinion \"refutes the very test which it establishes.\" \n369 \nU.S., at 177\n (dissenting opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE). In addition, three Justices dissented in whole or in part from the conclusions derived from this statutory analysis.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] See Currie, supra, at 61-64 (1964); Note, 77 Harv. L.

C. C. regulations, 35 with civil rights, and only 52 with state or local law. 1965 Dir. Adm. Off. U.S. Courts Ann. Rep. II-25, II-28.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE CLARK concur, dissenting.\n\nLess than four years ago, this Court decided that a three-judge district court was required in suits brought under 28 U.S.C. 2281, even though the alleged \"ground of the unconstitutionality\" of the challenged statute was based upon a conflict between state and federal statutes. Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, \n369 \nU.S. 153\n.\n\nA state statute may violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Due Process Clause or some other express provision of the Constitution. If so a three-judge court is plainly required by 28 U.S.C. 2281. But the issue of the \"unconstitutionality\" of a state statute can be raised as clearly by a conflict between it and an Act of Congress as by a conflict between it and a provision of the Constitution. The Supremacy Clause, contained in Art. VI, cl. 2, of the Constitution, states as much in clear language:\n\n \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 130]\n\u00a0\n Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\"\n\n\n An issue of the \"unconstitutionality\" of a state statute is therefore presented whether the conflict is between a provision of the Constitution and a state enactment or between the latter and an Act of Congress. What Senator Overman, author of the three-judge provision, said of it in 1910 is as relevant to enjoining a state law on the ground of federal pre-emption as it is to enjoining it because it violates the Fourteenth Amendment:\n\n \"The point is, this amendment is for peace and good order in the State. Whenever one judge stands up in a State and enjoins the governor and the attorney-general, the people resent it, and public sentiment is stirred, as it was in my State, when there was almost a rebellion, whereas if three judges declare that a state statute is unconstitutional the people would rest easy under it. But let one little judge stand up against the whole State, and you find the people of the State rising up in rebellion. The whole purpose of the proposed statute is for peace and good order among the people of the States.\" 45 Cong. Rec. 7256.\n\n\n Some of the most heated controversies between State and Nation which this Court has supervised have involved questions whether there was a conflict between a state statute and a federal one or whether a federal Act was so inclusive as to pre-empt state action in the particular area. One of the earliest and most tumultuous was Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 440, where the alleged unconstitutionality of a Virginia law was based on the argument that an Act of Congress, authorizing a lottery in the District of Columbia, barred Virginia from making it a criminal offense to sell lottery \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 131]\n\u00a0\n tickets within that State. The protest from the States was vociferous\n1\n even though the Court in the end construed the federal Act to keep it from operating in Virginia. Id., at 447. I therefore see no difference between a charge of \"unconstitutionality\" of a state statute whether the conflict be between it and the Constitution or between it and a federal law. Neither the language of the Supremacy Clause nor reason nor history makes any difference plain.\n\nPre-emption or conflict of a state law with a federal one is a recurring theme\n2\n arising in various contexts. The storm against Cohens v. Virginia was a protest against this Court's acting as referee in a federal-state contest involving pre-emption or a conflict between the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 132]\n\u00a0\n laws of the two regimes. Congress has recently been concerned with the problem in another aspect of the matter,\n3\n when efforts were made to curb the doctrine of pre-emption by establishing standards for an interpretation of an Act of Congress.\n4\n The three-judge court is only another facet of the self-same problem.\n\nThe history of 28 U.S.C. 2281, as related by the Court, speaks of the concern of Congress over the power \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 133]\n\u00a0\n of one judge to bring a halt to an entire state regulatory scheme. That can - and will hereafter - happen in all cases of pre-emption or conflict where the Supremacy Clause is thought to require state policy to give way. A fairly recent example is Cloverleaf Co. v. Patterson, \n315 \nU.S. 148\n, where a federal court injunction in a pre-emption case suspended Alabama's program for control of renovated butter - a demonstrably important health measure. The Court in Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, \n362 \nU.S. 73\n, where one of the issues was pre-emption or conflict between two statutory systems, emphasized that the interest of the States in being free from such injunctive interference at the instance of a single judge outweighed the additional burdens that such a rule imposed on the federal court system. On reflection I think that result better reflects congressional policy even though, as in Cohens v. Virginia, the end result is only a matter of statutory construction.\n\nOn the basis of virtually no experience in applying that interpretation of the statute, a majority has now decided that the rule of Kesler is \"unworkable\" and, therefore, that our previous interpretation of the statute must have been incorrect. I regret that I am unable to join in that decision. My objection is not that the Court has not given Kesler \"a more respectful burial,\" Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335, 349\n (concurring opinion), but that the Court has engaged in unwarranted infanticide.\n\nStare decisis is no immutable principle.\n5\n There are many occasions when this Court has overturned a prior decision, especially in matters involving an interpretation of the Constitution or where the problem of statutory construction had constitutional overtones.\n\nAn error in interpreting a federal statute may be easily remedied. If this Court has failed to perceive the intention \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 134]\n\u00a0\n of Congress, or has interpreted a statute in such a manner as to thwart the legislative purpose, Congress may change it. The lessons of experience are not learned by judges alone.\n\nI am unable to find a justification for overturning a decision of this Court interpreting this Act of Congress, announced only on March 26, 1962.\n\nIf the Court were able to show that our decision in Kesler had thrown the lower courts into chaos, a fair case for its demise might be made out. The Court calls the rule \"unworkable.\" But it is not enough to attach that label. The Court broadly asserts that \"lower courts have quite evidently sought to avoid dealing with its [Kesler's] application or have interpreted it with uncertainty.\" For this proposition, only three cases (in addition to the instant case) are cited. The Court's failure to provide more compelling documentation for its indictment of Kesler is not the result of less than meticulous scholarship, for so far as I have been able to discover, the truth of the matter is that there are no cases (not even the three cited) even remotely warranting the conclusion that Kesler is \"unworkable.\"\n\nKesler was an attempt to harmonize our earlier cases. If the Kesler test is \"unworkable\" as the Court asserts, we should nonetheless accept its basic premise:\n\n\"Neither the language of 2281 nor the purpose which gave rise to it affords the remotest reason for carving out an unfrivolous claim of unconstitutionality because of the Supremacy Clause from the comprehensive language of 2281.\" \n369 \nU.S., at 156\n.\n\n\n If there is overruling to be done, we should overrule Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, and Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n.\n\nThat the ground of unconstitutionality in many so-called Supremacy Clause cases is found only in the asserted conflict between federal and state statutes is, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 111, 135]\n\u00a0\n as I have said, no basis for distinguishing that class of cases from others in which three-judge courts are plainly required. While courts are, strictly speaking, engaging in statutory construction in such cases, the task of adjudication is much the same as in what all would concede to be constitutional adjudication. Though the purpose of Congress is the final touchstone, the interests which must be taken into account in either case are much the same, as Cohens v. Virginia eloquently demonstrates.\n\nThe Court has decided, on no more than the gloomy predictions contained in a handful of law review articles, that Kesler would inevitably produce chaos in the federal courts, that the rule announced there is \"unworkable.\" Those predictions have plainly not been borne out. If difficulties arise, Congress can cure them. Until Congress acts, I would let Kesler stand.\n\nI therefore believe that a three-judge court was properly convened and that we should decide this appeal on the merits.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History, p. 552 et seq. (1928).\n\n\"The Richmond Enquirer spoke of the opinion, `so important in its consequences and so obnoxious in its doctrines,' and said that `the very title of the case is enough to stir one's blood.' It feared that `the Judiciary power, with a foot as noiseless as time and a spirit as greedy as the grave, is sweeping to their destruction the rights of the States. . . . These encroachments have increased, are increasing and ought to be diminished'; and it advocated a repeal of the fatal Section of the Judiciary Act as `the most advisable and constitutional remedy for the evil.' A leading Ohio paper spoke of `the alarming progress of the Supreme Court in subverting the Federalist principles of the Constitution and introducing on their ruins a mighty consolidated empire fitted for the sceptre of a great monarch'; and it continued: `That the whole tenor of their decisions, when State-Rights have been involved, have had a direct tendency to reduce our governors to the condition of mere provincial satraps, and that a silent acquiescence in these decisions will bring us to this lamentable result, is to us as clear as mathematical demonstration.'\" Id., at 552-553.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Thus the dissent in Cloverleaf Co. v. Patterson, \n315 \nU.S. 148, 179\n, called that decision in favor of pre-emption \"purely destructive legislation.\" And see Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S. 218\n; Campbell v. Hussey, \n368 \nU.S. 297\n. Cf. Hostetter v. Idlewild Liquor Corp., \n377 \nU.S. 324\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] H.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nInvoking this Court's original jurisdiction under Art. III, 2, of the Constitution,\n1\n Texas brought this action against New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Sun Oil Company for an injunction and declaration of rights to settle a controversy as to which State has jurisdiction to take title to certain abandoned intangible personal property through escheat, a procedure with ancient origins\n2\n whereby a sovereign may acquire title to abandoned property if after a number of years no rightful owner appears. The property in question here consists of various small debts totaling $26,461.65\n3\n which the Sun Oil Company for periods of approximately seven to 40 years prior to the bringing of this action has owed to approximately 1,730 small creditors who have never appeared to collect them. The amounts owed, most of them resulting from failure of creditors to claim or cash checks, are either evidenced on the books of Sun's two Texas offices or are owing to persons whose last known address was in Texas, or both.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 676]\n\u00a0\n Texas says that this intangible property should be treated as situated in Texas, so as to permit that State to escheat it. New Jersey claims the right to escheat the same property because Sun is incorporated in New Jersey. Pennsylvania claims power to escheat part or all of the same property on the ground that Sun's principal business offices were in that State. Sun has disclaimed any interest in the property for itself, and asks only to be protected from the possibility of double liability. Since we held in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n368 \nU.S. 71\n, that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents more than one State from escheating a given item of property, we granted Texas leave to file this complaint against New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Sun, \n371 \nU.S. 873\n, and referred the case to the Honorable Walter A. Huxman to sit as Special Master to take evidence \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 677]\n\u00a0\n and make appropriate reports, \n372 \nU.S. 926\n.\n5\n Florida was permitted to intervene since it claimed the right to escheat the portion of Sun's escheatable obligations owing to persons whose last known address was in Florida. \n373 \nU.S. 948\n.\n6\n The Master has filed his report. Texas and New Jersey each have filed exceptions to it, and the case is now ready for our decision. We agree with the Master's recommendation as to the proper disposition of the property.\n\nWith respect to tangible property, real or personal, it has always been the unquestioned rule in all jurisdictions that only the State in which the property is located may escheat. But intangible property, such as a debt which a person is entitled to collect, is not physical matter which can be located on a map. The creditor may live in one State, the debtor in another, and matters may be further complicated if, as in the case before us, the debtor is a corporation which has connections with many States and each creditor is a person who may have had connections with several others and whose present address is unknown. Since the States separately are without constitutional power to provide a rule to settle this interstate controversy and since there is no applicable federal statute, it becomes our responsibility in the exercise of our original jurisdiction to adopt a rule which will settle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat this intangible property. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 678]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFour different possible rules are urged upon us by the respective States which are parties to this case. Texas, relying on numerous recent decisions of state courts dealing with choice of law in private litigation,\n7\n says that the State with the most significant \"contacts\" with the debt should be allowed exclusive jurisdiction to escheat it, and that by that test Texas has the best claim to escheat every item of property involved here. Cf. Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306\n; Atkinson v. Superior Court, 49 Cal. 2d 338, 316 P.2d 960, appeals dismissed and cert. denied sub nom. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Atkinson, \n357 \nU.S. 569\n. But the rule that Texas proposes, we believe, would serve only to leave in permanent turmoil a question which should be settled once and for all by a clear rule which will govern all types of intangible obligations like these and to which all States may refer with confidence. The issue before us is not whether a defendant has had sufficient contact with a State to make him or his property rights subject to the jurisdiction of its courts, a jurisdiction which need not be exclusive. Compare McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., \n355 \nU.S. 220\n; Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., supra; International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n.\n8\n Since this Court has held in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, that the same property cannot constitutionally be escheated \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 679]\n\u00a0\n by more than one State, we are faced here with the very different problem of deciding which State's claim to escheat is superior to all others. The \"contacts\" test as applied in this field is not really any workable test at all - it is simply a phrase suggesting that this Court should examine the circumstances surrounding each particular item of escheatable property on its own peculiar facts and then try to make a difficult, often quite subjective, decision as to which State's claim to those pennies or dollars seems stronger than another's. Under such a doctrine any State likely would easily convince itself, and hope to convince this Court, that its claim should be given priority - as is shown by Texas' argument that it has a superior claim to every single category of assets involved in this case. Some of them Texas says it should be allowed to escheat because the last known addresses of the creditors were in Texas, others it claims in spite of the fact that the last known addresses were not in Texas. The uncertainty of any test which would require us in effect either to decide each escheat case on the basis of its particular facts or to devise new rules of law to apply to ever-developing new categories of facts, might in the end create so much uncertainty and threaten so much expensive litigation that the States might find that they would lose more in litigation expenses than they might gain in escheats.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nNew Jersey asks us to hold that the State with power to escheat is the domicile of the debtor - in this case New Jersey, the State of Sun's incorporation. This plan has \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 680]\n\u00a0\n the obvious virtues of clarity and ease of application. But it is not the only one which does, and it seems to us that in deciding a question which should be determined primarily on principles of fairness, it would too greatly exalt a minor factor to permit escheat of obligations incurred all over the country by the State in which the debtor happened to incorporate itself.\n\nIn some respects the claim of Pennsylvania, where Sun's principal offices are located, is more persuasive, since this State is probably foremost in giving the benefits of its economy and laws to the company whose business activities made the intangible property come into existence. On the other hand, these debts owed by Sun are not property to it, but rather a liability, and it would be strange to convert a liability into an asset when the State decides to escheat. Cf. Case of the State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 320. Moreover, application of the rule Pennsylvania suggests would raise in every case the sometimes difficult question of where a company's \"main office\" or \"principal place of business\" or whatever it might be designated is located. Similar uncertainties would result if we were to attempt in each case to determine the State in which the debt was created and allow it to escheat. Any rule leaving so much for decision on a case-by-case basis should not be adopted unless none is available which is more certain and yet still fair. We think the rule proposed by the Master, based on the one suggested by Florida, is.\n\nThe rule Florida suggests is that since a debt is property of the creditor, not of the debtor,\n10\n fairness among the States requires that the right and power to escheat the debt should be accorded to the State of the creditor's \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 681]\n\u00a0\n last known address as shown by the debtor's books and records.\n11\n Such a solution would be in line with one group of cases dealing with intangible property for other purposes in other areas of the law.\n12\n Adoption of such a rule involves a factual issue simple and easy to resolve, and leaves no legal issue to be decided. It takes account of the fact that if the creditor instead of perhaps leaving behind an uncashed check had negotiated the check and left behind the cash, this State would have been the sole possible escheat claimant; in other words, the rule recognizes that the debt was an asset of the creditor. The rule recommended by the Master will tend to distribute escheats among the States in the proportion of the commercial activities of their residents. And by using a standard of last known address, rather than technical legal concepts of residence and domicile, administration and application of escheat laws should be simplified. It may well be that some addresses left by vanished creditors will be in States other than those in which they lived at the time the obligation arose or at the time of the escheat. But such situations probably will be the exception, and any errors thus created, if indeed they could be called errors, probably will tend to a large extent to cancel each other out. We therefore hold that each item of property \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 682]\n\u00a0\n in question in this case is subject to escheat only by the State of the last known address of the creditor, as shown by the debtor's books and records.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThis leaves questions as to what is to be done with property owed persons (1) as to whom there is no record of any address at all, or (2) whose last known address is in a State which does not provide for escheat of the property owed them. The Master suggested as to the first situation - where there is no last known address - that the property be subject to escheat by the State of corporate domicile, provided that another State could later escheat upon proof that the last known address of the creditor was within its borders. Although not mentioned by the Master, the same rule could apply to the second situation mentioned above, that is, where the State of the last known address does not, at the time in question, provide for escheat of the property. In such a case the State of corporate domicile could escheat the property, subject to the right of the State of the last known address to recover it if and when its law made provision for escheat of such property. In other words, in both situations the State of corporate domicile should be allowed to cut off the claims of private persons only, retaining the property for itself only until some other State comes forward with proof that it has a superior right to escheat. Such a solution for these problems, likely to arise with comparative infrequency, seems to us conducive to needed certainty and we therefore adopt it. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 683]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe realize that this case could have been resolved otherwise, for the issue here is not controlled by statutory or constitutional provisions or by past decisions, nor is it entirely one of logic. It is fundamentally a question of ease of administration and of equity. We believe that the rule we adopt is the fairest, is easy to apply, and in the long run will be the most generally acceptable to all the States.\n\nThe parties may submit a proposed decree applying the principles announced in this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The judicial Power shall extend . . . to Controversies between two or more States . . . .\n\n\"In all Cases . . . in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n 28 U.S.C. 1251 (a) (1958 ed.) provides in relevant part:\n\n\"The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of:\n\n\n\"(1) All controversies between two or more States . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See generally Enever, Bona Vacantia Under the Law of England; Note, 61 Col.

The other States voluntarily agreed not to act pending determination of this case, and so the motion for injunctions was denied. \n370 \nU.S. 929\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Illinois, which claims no interest in the property involved in this case, also sought to intervene to urge that jurisdiction to escheat should depend on the laws of the State in which the indebtedness was created. Leave to intervene was denied. \n372 \nU.S. 973\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] E. g., Schmidt v. Driscoll Hotel, Inc., 249 Minn. 376, 82 N. W. 2d 365; Auten v. Auten, 308 N. Y. 155, 124 N.

Green, \n329 \nU.S. 156\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Nor, since we are dealing only with escheat, are we concerned with the power of a state legislature to regulate activities affecting the State, power which like court jurisdiction need not be exclusive. Compare Osborn v. Ozlin, \n310 \nU.S. 53\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Texas argues in particular that at least the part of the intangible obligations here which are royalties, rents, and mineral proceeds derived from land located in Texas should be escheatable only by that State. We do not believe that the fact that an intangible is income from real property with a fixed situs is significant enough to justify treating it as an exception to a general rule concerning escheat of intangibles.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] On this point Florida stresses what is essentially a variation of the old concept of \"mobilia sequuntur personam,\" according to which intangible personal property is found at the domicile of its owner. See Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 9\n-10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] We agree with the Master that since our inquiry here is not concerned with the technical domicile of the creditor, and since ease of administration is important where many small sums of money are involved, the address on the records of the debtor, which in most cases will be the only one available, should be the only relevant last-known address.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See, e. g., Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n; Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n. However, it has been held that a State may allow an unpaid creditor to garnish a debt owing to his debtor wherever the person owing that debt is found. Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215\n. But cf. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Dunlevy, \n241 \nU.S. 518\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Cf. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Moore, \n333 \nU.S. 541\n. As was pointed out in Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n368 \nU.S. 71, 77\n-78, none of this Court's cases allowing States to escheat intangible property decided the possible effect of conflicting claims of other States. Compare Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, \n341 \nU.S. 428, 443\n; Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Moore, supra; Anderson National Bank v. Luckett, \n321 \nU.S. 233\n; Security Savings Bank v. California, \n263 \nU.S. 282\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.\n\nI adhere to the view that only the State of the debtor's incorporation has power to \"escheat\" intangible property when the whereabouts of the creditor are unknown. See Western Union Tel. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n368 \nU.S. 71, 80\n (separate memorandum). The sovereign's power to escheat tangible property has long been recognized as extending only to the limits of its territorial jurisdiction. Intangible property has no spatial existence, but consists of an obligation owed one person by another. The power to escheat such property has traditionally been thought to be lodged in the domiciliary State of one of the parties to the obligation. In a case such as this the domicile of the creditor is by hypothesis unknown; only the domicile of the debtor is known. This Court has thrice ruled that where the creditor has disappeared, the State of the debtor's domicile may escheat the intangible property. Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, \n341 \nU.S. 428\n; Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, \n321 \nU.S. 233\n; Security Savings Bank v. California, \n263 \nU.S. 282\n. Today the Court overrules all three of those cases. I would not do so. Adherence to settled precedent seems to me far better than giving the property to the State within which is located the one place where we know the creditor is not. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 674, 684]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS v.

Darlington Manufacturing Co. et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n A majority of the stock of Darlington Manufacturing Company, a textile mill, was owned by Deering Milliken, a marketing corporation, and the National Labor Relations Board found that the latter company was in turn controlled by Roger Milliken, Darlington's president, and members of his family. An organizational campaign by petitioner union at Darlington, although strongly resisted by the company, including threats to close the mill, was successful. Shortly thereafter the company was liquidated, the plant closed and the equipment sold. The National Labor Relations Board found that the closing was due to Roger Milliken's antiunion animus, a violation of 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act; that Darlington was part of a single integrated employer group controlled by the Milliken family through Deering Milliken, operating 17 textile companies with 27 mills; and, alternatively, since Darlington was part of the integrated enterprise, Deering Milliken violated the Act by closing part of its business for a discriminatory purpose. The Court of Appeals held that, even assuming Deering Milliken was a single employer, it had the right to terminate all or part of its business regardless of antiunion motives. Held:\n\n 1. It is not an unfair labor practice for an employer to close his entire business, even if the closing is due to antiunion animus. Pp. 269-274.\n\n\n 2. Closing part of a business is an unfair labor practice under 8 (a) (3) of the Act if the purpose is to discourage unionism in any of the employer's remaining plants and if the employer may reasonably have foreseen such effect. Pp. 274-275. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 3. If those exercising control over a plant that is being closed for antiunion reasons have an interest in another business, whether or not affiliated with or in the same line of commerce as the closed plant, of sufficient substantiality to promise a benefit from non-unionization of that business: act to close their plant for that purpose; and have a relationship to the other business which makes it probable that its employees will fear closing down if organizational activities are continued, an unfair labor practice has been made out. Pp. 275-276.\n\n\n 4. Since no findings were made by the Board as to the purpose and effect of the Darlington closing with respect to the employees of the other plants in the Deering Milliken group, the judgments are vacated and the cases remanded to permit such findings to be made.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe here review judgments of the Court of Appeals setting aside and refusing to enforce an order of the National Labor Relations Board which found respondent Darlington guilty of an unfair labor practice by reason of having permanently closed its plant following petitioner union's election as the bargaining representative of Darlington's employees.\n\nDarlington Manufacturing Company was a South Carolina corporation operating one textile mill. A majority of Darlington's stock was held by Deering Milliken, a New York \"selling house\" marketing textiles produced by others.\n1\n Deering Milliken in turn was controlled by Roger Milliken, president of Darlington, and by other members of the Milliken family.\n2\n The National Labor Relations Board found that the Milliken family, through Deering Milliken, operated 17 textile manufacturers, including Darlington, whose products, manufactured in 27 different mills, were marketed through Deering Milliken.\n\nIn March 1956 petitioner Textile Workers Union initiated an organizational campaign at Darlington which the company resisted vigorously in various ways, including threats to close the mill if the union won a representation election.\n3\n On September 6, 1956, the union won an \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n election by a narrow margin. When Roger Milliken was advised of the union victory, he decided to call a meeting of the Darlington board of directors to consider closing the mill. Mr. Milliken testified before the Labor Board:\n\n \"I felt that as a result of the campaign that had been conducted and the promises and statements made in these letters that had been distributed [favoring unionization], that if before we had had some hope, possible hope of achieving competitive [costs] . . . by taking advantage of new machinery that was being put in, that this hope had diminished as a result of the election because a majority of the employees had voted in favor of the union . . . .\" (R. 457.)\n\n\n The board of directors met on September 12 and voted to liquidate the corporation, action which was approved by the stockholders on October 17. The plant ceased operations entirely in November, and all plant machinery and equipment were sold piecemeal at auction in December.\n\nThe union filed charges with the Labor Board claiming that Darlington had violated 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act by closing its plant.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n and 8 (a) (5) by refusing to bargain with the union after the election.\n5\n The Board, by a divided vote, found that Darlington had been closed because of the antiunion animus of Roger Milliken, and held that to be a violation of 8 (a) (3).\n6\n The Board also found Darlington to be part of a single integrated employer group controlled by the Milliken family through Deering Milliken; therefore Deering Milliken could be held liable for the unfair labor practices of Darlington.\n7\n Alternatively, since Darlington was a part of the Deering Milliken enterprise, Deering Milliken had violated the Act by closing part of its business for a discriminatory purpose. The Board ordered back pay for all Darlington employees until they obtained substantially equivalent work or were put on preferential hiring lists at the other Deering Milliken mills. Respondent Deering Milliken was ordered to bargain with the union in regard to details of compliance with the Board order. 139 N. L. R. B. 241. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn review, the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, set aside the order and denied enforcement by a divided vote. 325 F.2d 682. The Court of Appeals held that even accepting arguendo the Board's determination that Deering Milliken had the status of a single employer, a company has the absolute right to close out a part or all of its business regardless of antiunion motives. The court therefore did not review the Board's finding that Deering Milliken was a single integrated employer. We granted certiorari, \n377 \nU.S. 903\n, to consider the important questions involved. We hold that so far as the Labor Relations Act is concerned, an employer has the absolute right to terminate his entire business for any reason he pleases, but disagree with the Court of Appeals that such right includes the ability to close part of a business no matter what the reason. We conclude that the cause must be remanded to the Board for further proceedings.\n\nPreliminarily it should be observed that both petitioners argue that the Darlington closing violated 8 (a) (1) as well as 8 (a) (3) of the Act. We think, however, that the Board was correct in treating the closing only under 8 (a) (3).\n8\n Section 8 (a) (1) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer \"to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\" 7 rights.\n9\n Naturally, certain business decisions will, to some \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n degree, interfere with concerted activities by employees. But it is only when the interference with 7 rights outweighs the business justification for the employer's action that 8 (a) (1) is violated. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Steelworkers, \n357 \nU.S. 357\n; Republic Aviation Corp. v. Labor Board, \n324 \nU.S. 793\n. A violation of 8 (a) (1) alone therefore presupposes an act which is unlawful even absent a discriminatory motive. Whatever may be the limits of 8 (a) (1), some employer decisions are so peculiarly matters of management prerogative that they would never constitute violations of 8 (a) (1), whether or not they involved sound business judgment, unless they also violated 8 (a) (3). Thus it is not questioned in this case that an employer has the right to terminate his business, whatever the impact of such action on concerted activities, if the decision to close is motivated by other than discriminatory reasons.\n10\n But such action, if discriminatorily motivated, is encompassed within the literal language of 8 (a) (3). We therefore deal with the Darlington closing under that section.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWe consider first the argument, advanced by the petitioner union but not by the Board, and rejected by the Court of Appeals, that an employer may not go completely out of business without running afoul of the Labor Relations Act if such action is prompted by a desire to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n avoid unionization.\n11\n Given the Board's findings on the issue of motive, acceptance of this contention would carry the day for the Board's conclusion that the closing of this plant was an unfair labor practice, even on the assumption that Darlington is to be regarded as an independent unrelated employer. A proposition that a single businessman cannot choose to go out of business if he wants to would represent such a startling innovation that it should not be entertained without the clearest manifestation of legislative intent or unequivocal judicial precedent so construing the Labor Relations Act. We find neither.\n\nSo far as legislative manifestation is concerned, it is sufficient to say that there is not the slightest indication in the history of the Wagner Act or of the Taft-Hartley Act that Congress envisaged any such result under either statute.\n\nAs for judicial precedent, the Board recognized that \"[t]here is no decided case directly dispositive of Darlington's claim that it had an absolute right to close its mill, irrespective of motive.\" 139 N. L. R. B., at 250. The only language by this Court in any way adverting to this problem is found in Southport Petroleum Co. v. Labor Board, \n315 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, where it was stated:\n\n\"Whether there was a bona fide discontinuance and a true change of ownership - which would terminate the duty of reinstatement created by the Board's order - or merely a disguised continuance of the old employer, does not clearly appear . . . .\"\n\n\n The courts of appeals have generally assumed that a complete cessation of business will remove an employer \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n from future coverage by the Act. Thus the Court of Appeals said in these cases: The Act \"does not compel a person to become or remain an employee. It does not compel one to become or remain an employer. Either may withdraw from that status with immunity, so long as the obligations of any employment contract have been met.\" 325 F.2d, at 685. The Eighth Circuit, in Labor Board v. New Madrid Mfg. Co., 215 F.2d 908, 914, was equally explicit:\n\n \"But none of this can be taken to mean that an employer does not have the absolute right, at all times, to permanently close and go out of business . . . for whatever reason he may choose, whether union animosity or anything else, and without his being thereby left subject to a remedial liability under the Labor Management Relations Act for such unfair labor practices as he may have committed in the enterprise, except up to the time that such actual and permanent closing . . . has occurred.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n The AFL-CIO suggests in its amicus brief that Darlington's action was similar to a discriminatory lockout, which is prohibited \"`because designed to frustrate organizational efforts, to destroy or undermine bargaining representation, or to evade the duty to bargain.'\"\n13\n One of the purposes of the Labor Relations Act is to prohibit the discriminatory use of economic weapons in an effort to obtain future benefits. The discriminatory lockout designed to destroy a union, like a \"runaway shop,\" is a lever which has been used to discourage collective employee activities \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 272]\n\u00a0\n in the future. But a complete liquidation of a business yields no such future benefit for the employer, if the termination is bona fide.\n14\n It may be motivated more by spite against the union than by business reasons, but it is not the type of discrimination which is prohibited by the Act. The personal satisfaction that such an employer may derive from standing on his beliefs and the mere possibility that other employers will follow his example are surely too remote to be considered dangers at which the labor statutes were aimed.\n15\n Although employees may be prohibited from engaging in a strike under certain conditions, no one would consider it a violation of the Act for the same employees to quit their employment en masse, even if motivated by a desire to ruin the employer. The very permanence of such action would negate any future economic benefit to the employees. The employer's right to go out of business is no different.\n\nWe are not presented here with the case of a \"runaway shop,\"\n16\n whereby Darlington would transfer its \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 273]\n\u00a0\n work to another plant or open a new plant in another locality to replace its closed plant.\n17\n Nor are we concerned with a shutdown where the employees, by renouncing the union, could cause the plant to reopen.\n18\n Such cases would involve discriminatory employer action for the purpose of obtaining some benefit from the employees in the future.\n19\n We hold here only that when \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 274]\n\u00a0\n an employer closes his entire business, even if the liquidation is motivated by vindictiveness toward the union, such action is not an unfair labor practice.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWhile we thus agree with the Court of Appeals that viewing Darlington as an independent employer the liquidation of its business was not an unfair labor practice, we cannot accept the lower court's view that the same conclusion necessarily follows if Darlington is regarded as an integral part of the Deering Milliken enterprise.\n\nThe closing of an entire business, even though discriminatory, ends the employer-employee relationship; the force of such a closing is entirely spent as to that business when termination of the enterprise takes place. On the other hand, a discriminatory partial closing may have \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 275]\n\u00a0\n repercussions on what remains of the business, affording employer leverage for discouraging the free exercise of 7 rights among remaining employees of much the same kind as that found to exist in the \"runaway shop\" and \"temporary closing\" cases. See supra, pp. 272-273. Moreover, a possible remedy open to the Board in such a case, like the remedies available in the \"runaway shop\" and \"temporary closing\" cases, is to order reinstatement of the discharged employees in the other parts of the business.\n21\n No such remedy is available when an entire business has been terminated. By analogy to those cases involving a continuing enterprise we are constrained to hold, in disagreement with the Court of Appeals, that a partial closing is an unfair labor practice under 8 (a) (3) if motivated by a purpose to chill unionism in any of the remaining plants of the single employer and if the employer may reasonably have foreseen that such closing would likely have that effect.\n\nWhile we have spoken in terms of a \"partial closing\" in the context of the Board's finding that Darlington was part of a larger single enterprise controlled by the Milliken family, we do not mean to suggest that an organizational integration of plants or corporations is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of such a violation of 8 (a) (3). If the persons exercising control over a plant that is being closed for antiunion reasons (1) have an interest in another business, whether or not affiliated with or engaged in the same line of commercial activity as the closed plant, of sufficient substantiality to give promise of their reaping a benefit from the discouragement of unionization in that business; (2) act to close their plant with the purpose of producing such a result; and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 276]\n\u00a0\n (3) occupy a relationship to the other business which makes it realistically foreseeable that its employees will fear that such business will also be closed down if they persist in organizational activities, we think that an unfair labor practice has been made out.\n\nAlthough the Board's single employer finding necessarily embraced findings as to Roger Milliken and the Milliken family which, if sustained by the Court of Appeals, would satisfy the elements of \"interest\" and \"relationship\" with respect to other parts of the Deering Milliken enterprise, that and the other Board findings fall short of establishing the factors of \"purpose\" and \"effect\" which are vital requisites of the general principles that govern a case of this kind.\n\nThus, the Board's findings as to the purpose and foreseeable effect of the Darlington closing pertained only to its impact on the Darlington employees. No findings were made as to the purpose and effect of the closing with respect to the employees in the other plants comprising the Deering Milliken group. It does not suffice to establish the unfair labor practice charged here to argue that the Darlington closing necessarily had an adverse impact upon unionization in such other plants. We have heretofore observed that employer action which has a foreseeable consequence of discouraging concerted activities generally.\n22\n does not amount to a violation of 8 (a) (3) in the absence of a showing of motivation which is aimed at achieving the prohibited effect. See Teamsters Local v. Labor Board, \n365 \nU.S. 667\n, and the concurring opinion therein, at 677. In an area which trenches so closely upon otherwise legitimate employer prerogatives, we consider the absence of Board findings on this score a fatal defect in its decision. The Court of Appeals for its part \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 277]\n\u00a0\n did not deal with the question of purpose and effect at all, since it concluded that an employer's right to close down his entire business because of distaste for unionism, also embraced a partial closing so motivated.\n\nApart from this, the Board's holding should not be accepted or rejected without court review of its single employer finding, judged, however, in accordance with the general principles set forth above. Review of that finding, which the lower court found unnecessary on its view of the cause, now becomes necessary in light of our holding in this part of our opinion, and is a task that devolves upon the Court of Appeals in the first instance. Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n.\n\nIn these circumstances, we think the proper disposition of this cause is to require that it be remanded to the Board so as to afford the Board the opportunity to make further findings on the issue of purpose and effect. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., \n314 \nU.S. 469, 479\n-480. This is particularly appropriate here since the cases involve issues of first impression. If such findings are made, the cases will then be in a posture for further review by the Court of Appeals on all issues. Accordingly, without intimating any view as to how any of these matters should eventuate, we vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases to that court with instructions to remand them to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the decision of these cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Deering Milliken & Co. owned 41% of the Darlington stock. Cotwool Manufacturing Corp., another textile manufacturer, owned 18% of the stock. In 1960 Deering Milliken & Co. was merged into Cotwool, the survivor being named Deering Milliken, Inc.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Milliken family owned only 6% of the Darlington stock, but held a majority stock interest in both Deering Milliken & Co. and Cotwool, see n. 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Board found that Darlington had interrogated employees and threatened to close the mill if the union won the election. After the decision to liquidate was made (see infra), Darlington employees were told that the decision to close was caused by the election, and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n they were encouraged to sign a petition disavowing the union. These practices were held to violate 8 (a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, n. 4, infra, and that part of the Board decision is not challenged here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] National Labor Relations Act, 8 (a) (1) and (3), as amended, 61 Stat. 140 (1947), 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1) and (3) (1958 ed.). provide in pertinent part: \"(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer - \"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7 [section 157 of this title]; .   .   .   .   . \"(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The union asked for a bargaining conference on September 12, 1956 (the day that the board of directors voted to liquidate), but was told to await certification by the Board. The union was certified on October 24, and did meet with Darlington officials in November, but no actual bargaining took place. The Board found this to be a violation of 8 (a) (5). Such a finding was in part based on the determination that the plant closing was an unfair labor practice, and no argument is made that 8 (a) (5) requires an employer to bargain concerning a purely business decision to terminate his enterprise. Cf. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. Labor Board, \n379 \nU.S. 203\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Since the closing was held to be illegal, the Board found that the gradual discharges of all employees during November and December constituted 8 (a) (1) violations. The propriety of this determination depends entirely on whether the decision to close the plant violated 8 (a) (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Members Leedom and Rodgers agreed with the trial examiner that Deering Milliken was not a single employer. Member Rodgers dissented in arguing that Darlington had not violated 8 (a) (3) by closing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Board did find that Darlington's discharges of employees following the decision to close violated 8 (a) (1). See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] NLRA 7, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 157 (1958 ed.), provides: \"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 8 (a) (3) [section 158 (a) (3) of this title].\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] It is also clear that the ambiguous act of closing a plant following the election of a union is not, absent an inquiry into the employer's motive, inherently discriminatory. We are thus not confronted with a situation where the employer \"must be held to intend the very consequences which foreseeably and inescapably flow from his actions . . .\" (Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., \n373 \nU.S. 221, 228\n), in which the Board could find a violation of 8 (a) (3) without an examination into motive. See Radio Officers v. Labor Board, \n347 \nU.S. 17, 42\n-43; Teamsters Local v. Labor Board, \n365 \nU.S. 667, 674\n-676.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Board predicates its argument on the finding that Deering Milliken was an integrated enterprise, and does not consider it necessary to argue that an employer may not go completely out of business for antiunion reasons. Brief for National Labor Relations Board, p. 3, n. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] In New Madrid the business was transferred to a new employer, which was held liable for the unfair labor practices committed by its predecessor before closing. The closing itself was not found to be an unfair labor practice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Brief for AFL-CIO, p. 7, quoting from Labor Board v. Truck Drivers Local, \n353 \nU.S. 87, 93\n. This brief was incorporated by reference as Point I of the petitioner union's brief in this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The Darlington property and equipment could not be sold as a unit, and were eventually auctioned off piecemeal. We therefore are not confronted with a sale of a going concern, which might present different considerations under 8 (a) (3) and (5). Cf. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, \n376 \nU.S. 543\n; Labor Board v. Deena Artware, Inc., \n361 \nU.S. 398\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Cf. NLRA 8 (c), 29 U.S.C. 158 (c) (1958 ed.).

Preston Feed Corp., 309 F.2d 346; Labor Board v. Wallick, 198 F.2d 477. An analogous problem is presented where a department is closed for antiunion reasons but the work is continued by independent contractors. See, e. g., Labor Board v.

Labor Board, 128 F.2d 960.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] After the decision to close the plant, Darlington accepted no new orders, and merely continued operations for a time to fill pending orders. 139 N. L. R. B., at 244.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] E. g., Labor Board v. Norma Mining Corp., 206 F.2d 38. Similarly, if all employees are discharged but the work continues with new personnel, the effect is to discourage any future union activities. See Labor Board v. Waterman S. S. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 206\n; Labor Board v. National Garment Co., 166 F.2d 233; Labor Board v. Stremel, 141 F.2d 317.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] All of the cases to which we have been cited involved closings found to have been motivated, at least in part, by the expectation of achieving future benefits. See cases cited in notes 16, 18, supra. The two cases which are urged as indistinguishable from Darlington are Labor Board v. Savoy Laundry, 327 F.2d 370, and Labor Board v. Missouri Transit Co., 250 F.2d 261. In Savoy Laundry the employer operated one laundry plant where he processed both retail laundry pickups and wholesale laundering. Once the laundry was marked, all of it was processed together. After some of the employees organized, the employer discontinued most of the wholesale service, and thereafter discharged some of his employees. There was no separate wholesale department, and the discriminatory motive was obviously to discourage unionization in the entire plant. Missouri Transit presents a similar situation. A bus company operated an interstate line and an intrastate shuttle services connecting a military base with the interstate terminal. When the union attempted to organize all of the drivers, the shuttle service was sold and the shuttle drivers were discharged. Although the two services were treated as separate departments, it is clear from the facts of the case that the union was attempting to organize all of the drivers, and the discriminatory motive of the employer was to discourage unionization in the interstate service as well as the shuttle service.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Nothing we have said in this opinion would justify an employer's interfering with employee organizational activities by threatening to close his plant, as distinguished from announcing a decision to close already reached by the board of directors or other management authority empowered to make such a decision. We recognize that this safeguard does not wholly remove the possibility that our holding may result in some deterrent effect on organizational activities independent of that arising from the closing itself. An employer may be encouraged to make a definitive decision to close on the theory that its mere announcement before a representation election will discourage the employees from voting for the union, and thus his decision may not have to be implemented. Such a possibility is not likely to occur, however, except in a marginal business; a solidly successful employer is not apt to hazard the possibility that the employees will call his bluff by voting to organize. We see no practical way of eliminating this possible consequence of our holding short of allowing the Board to order an employer who chooses so to gamble with his employees not to carry out his announced intention to close. We do not consider the matter of sufficient significance in the overall labor-management relations picture to require or justify a decision different from the one we have made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] In the view we take of these cases we do not reach any of the challenges made to the Board's remedy afforded here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] See n. 10, supra. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 263, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHOMAS v.

The application for a stay, addressed to MR. JUSTICE HARLAN as Circuit Justice and referred by him to the Court for consideration under Rule 50 (6), is denied.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nAn application has been made to me, as Circuit Justice, for a stay pending appeal from an order of a three-judge \n\n[381 \nU.S. 431, 432]\n\u00a0\n District Court, dated May 24, 1965, ordering New York to hold a special legislative election on November 2, 1965, under the electoral scheme embodied in reapportionment \"Plan A\"\n1\n passed by the New York Legislature, signed by the Governor, and held unconstitutional under the State Constitution by the New York Court of Appeals. The stay application was accompanied by a motion, addressed to the Court, asking for an acceleration and immediate hearing of the appeal, to which the relief sought from me is incident. Because the stay and acceleration questions were in my opinion inextricably related and involved issues of far-reaching importance, I referred the stay application to the full Court for determination (see Sup. Ct. Rule 50 (6)) in conjunction with the motion to accelerate the appeal. The Court now denies both the stay and motion to accelerate, and I respectfully dissent.\n\n\"Plan A\" was one of four alternative reapportionment plans passed by the New York Legislature under the impact of an order of the District Court, dated July 27, 1964, entered pursuant to this Court's decision in WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, \n377 \nU.S. 633\n, which held New York's then-existing method of legislative apportionment violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court order provided by way of interim relief that (1) the November 1964 legislative elections could proceed under the invalidated apportionment system, but the legislators would be permitted to serve for only a one-year period, instead of the two-year term provided in the State Constitution; (2) a special November 1965 election must be held under a constitutionally valid apportionment plan to be enacted by the New York Legislature and submitted to the District \n\n[381 \nU.S. 431, 433]\n\u00a0\n Court for approval not later than April 1, 1965 (later extended to May 5, 1965), the legislators so elected again to serve for only one year; and (3) the regularly scheduled November 1966 election, for a normal two-year term, would be held under the same or some other court-approved reapportionment plan. This Court summarily affirmed the District Court's order. Hughes v. WMCA, Inc., \n379 \nU.S. 694\n. Two dissenting Justices would have set the case for plenary consideration, and two concurring Justices expressly noted that the Court's action did not foreclose the District Court from modifying its interim order in light of subsequent developments.\n\n\n In December 1964 the 1964 Legislature, meeting in special session, passed and the Governor signed four alternative reapportionment plans, one of which, \"Plan A,\" is involved in the matter now before us. On January 26, 1965, the three-judge District Court found that \"Plan A\" satisfied federal constitutional requirements, but that each of the other plans did not. 238 F. Supp. 916. On April 14, 1965, the New York Court of Appeals held all four plans invalid under the State Constitution, in that each provided for an Assembly of more than 150 members, thus exceeding the membership limit prescribed by the New York Constitution, Art. 3, 2. In re Orans, 15 N. Y. 2d 339, 206 N. E. 2d 854.\n\nIgnoring the New York Court of Appeals' holding that Plan A violated the State Constitution, a majority of the District Court, on May 18, 1965, ordered the November 1965 state legislative election to proceed under that plan. One judge dissented, considering that a more appropriate, though admittedly not wholly satisfactory, \"interim\" solution would be to permit the November 1965 election to go forward under the old reapportionment formula, with the legislators thus elected being accorded \"weighted votes\" in the legislature based on population. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 431, 434]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 24, 1965, the State Legislature passed three bills, the substantial effects of which were (1) to adopt the dissenting district judge's weighted voting formula for the 1966 legislative session, without holding an election this fall;\n2\n (2) to create a bi-partisan commission to devise a new reapportionment formula for the 1966 election, meeting both federal and state constitutional requirements;\n3\n and (3) to issue a call for a constitutional convention to promulgate a permanent reapportionment plan to govern the 1968 and subsequent elections.\n4\n The Speaker of the Assembly and the President pro tem of the State Senate (the intervenors-appellants here) thereupon sought leave to intervene in the district court proceedings and to persuade the court to modify the interim relief in accordance with these legislative proposals. Their application for leave to intervene was granted, but the District Court refused to modify its earlier order. These applications for a stay and accelerated appeal followed immediately.\n\nThese matters bristle with difficult and important questions that touch the nerve centers of the sound operation of our federal and state judicial and political systems. They involve, among other things, the right of a federal court to order that one house of a state legislature shall temporarily be of greater size than is permitted by the State Constitution. Surely such questions are deserving of plenary consideration and reasoned explication. By denying a stay and refusing to accelerate this appeal, the Court, instead, has in effect decided them not only summarily but also sub silentio. For while the denial of a stay does not technically moot the appeal, it is manifest that such is the practical effect of the Court's action, since \n\n[381 \nU.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n in normal course the appeal will not even be heard until after the presently ordered November election has taken place.\n\nWithout prejudging the question, the propriety of a federal court's ordering a state election to proceed under a plan which the highest court of the State has found to violate the State Constitution in respects not claimed to be violative of the Federal Constitution, when a number of alternatives are available, raises what I consider to be very serious federal questions which this Court should at least hear. All parties have shown themselves willing to argue the case promptly. I would set the case for immediate argument, and would have the Court render its decision on the stay promptly thereafter, with opinions on the merits of the controversy to follow in due course. Compare Cooper v. Aaron, \n358 \nU.S. 1\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nI am wholly at a loss to understand the Court's casual way of disposing of this matter and I can find no considerations of any kind which justify it. The Court should be willing to face up articulately to these difficult problems which have followed as a not unnatural aftermath of its reapportionment decisions of last Term.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] New York Laws 1964, c. 976.

LOUISIANA(1965)\nNo. 53\nArgued: November 19, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n During petitioner's three-day murder trial, which resulted in his being found guilty and being sentenced to death, two deputy sheriffs who were the principal prosecution witnesses had custody of the jurors and as a result were in close and continuous association with them, freely mingling and conversing with them throughout the trial period. Though disapproving of the practice of officers who are witnesses having charge of the jury, the State Supreme Court found no prejudice to petitioner and affirmed his conviction. Held: the close and continuous association between key witnesses and the jury deprived the petitioner of the right to trial by an impartial jury which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires. Pp. 471-474.\n\n 244 La. 447, 152 So.2d 555, reversed and remanded.\n\nAllen B. Pierson, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Burrell J. Carter.\n\nLeonard E. Yokum argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Jack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana, M. E. Culligan, Assistant Attorney General, and Duncan S. Kemp.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, Wayne Turner, was indicted in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, upon a charge of murder committed during the course of a robbery. After a three-day trial a jury found him guilty as charged. He was sentenced to death. The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Louisiana,\n1\n and we granted certiorari\n2\n to consider the claim that the circumstances attending \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n the trial were such as to deprive Turner of a right secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe two principal witnesses for the prosecution at the trial were Vincent Rispone and Hulon Simmons. Both were deputy sheriffs of Tangipahoa Parish. On direct examination Rispone described in detail an investigation he said he had made at the scene of the murder. He further testified that he and Simmons later took Turner into custody, and that Turner had led them to a place in the woods where the cartridge clip from the murder weapon was recovered. Simmons corroborated Rispone's testimony about apprehending Turner and finding the cartridge clip, and also told of certain damaging admissions which he said had been made by Turner at the time of his apprehension. In addition, Simmons described the circumstances under which he said he had later prevailed upon Turner to make a written confession. This confession was introduced in evidence. Both Rispone and Simmons were cross-examined at length with respect to all aspects of their testimony. Turner did not take the witness stand in his own behalf.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe members of the jury were sequestered in accordance with Louisiana law during the course of the trial,\n4\n and were \"placed in charge of the Sheriff\" by the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n trial judge. In practice, this meant that the jurors were continuously in the company of deputy sheriffs of Tangipahoa Parish during the three days that the trial lasted. The deputies drove the jurors to a restaurant for each meal, and to their lodgings each night. The deputies ate with them, conversed with them, and did errands for them.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nTwo of the deputy sheriffs who were in this close and continual association with the jurors were Vincent Rispone and Hulon Simmons. Turner's counsel moved for a mistrial when Rispone testified as a witness for the prosecution, and made the same motion when Simmons testified. The brief hearings on these motions established that both Rispone and Simmons had in fact freely mingled and conversed with the jurors in and out of the courthouse during the trial.\n6\n The court denied the motions, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n however, upon the ground that there was no showing that either deputy had talked with any member of the jury about the case itself. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 470]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe court did not direct Rispone or Simmons to cease associating with the jury, and, so far as the record shows, the association continued for the remainder of the trial. After the jury returned its verdict of guilty, Turner's counsel filed a motion for a new trial upon substantially the same ground as had been urged in support of the earlier motions for a mistrial - that the two principal witnesses for the prosecution \"were in actual charge of the jury; that they were physically present with the jurors in and out of the jury room, in automobiles and in eating places with the jury members, mingling with the jurors . . . .\" This motion was denied without any further evidentiary hearing, and Turner was sentenced to death by electrocution.\n\nThe bill of exceptions filed by the trial court, upon which Turner's appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana was based, clearly included a Fourteenth Amendment claim.\n7\n In affirming the conviction, the State Supreme Court said:\n\n \"As we have pointed out, under the jurisprudence of this court unless there is a showing of prejudice, a conviction will not be set aside simply because officers who are witnesses in the case have the jury under their charge. This court is inclined to look upon the practice with disapproval, however, because in such cases there may be prejudice of a kind exceedingly difficult to establish. The practice should be especially condemned where, for instance, the testimony of the officer and that of the accused are in direct conflict and the jury is called upon to weigh the credibility of each, or where the officer is the principal \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n prosecuting witness.\" 244 La., at 454; 152 So.2d, at 557-558.\n\n\n While thus casting its judgment in terms of state law, the court's affirmance of Turner's conviction necessarily rejected his claim that the conduct of the trial had violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n8\n We hold otherwise with respect to the federal constitutional issue, and accordingly reverse the judgment before us.\n\nThis case does not involve the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to accord a jury trial to a defendant charged with murder.\n9\n The question, rather, goes to the nature of the jury trial which the Fourteenth Amendment commands when trial by jury is what the State has purported to accord. We had occasion to consider this basic question less than four years ago in Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n. That case did not involve the conduct of the trial itself, for there we found that the conviction could not constitutionally stand because the jury had been infected by prejudice before the actual trial proceedings had commenced. But what the Court said in that case is controlling here:\n\n\"In essence, the right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, `indifferent' jurors. The failure to accord an accused a fair hearing violates even the minimal \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n standards of due process. In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n. `A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.' In re Murchison, \n349 \nU.S. 133, 136\n. In the ultimate analysis, only the jury can strip a man of his liberty or his life. In the language of Lord Coke, a juror must be as `indifferent as he stands unsworne.' Co. Litt. 155b. His verdict must be based upon the evidence developed at the trial. Cf. Thompson v. City of Louisville, \n362 \nU.S. 199\n. This is true, regardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of the offender or the station in life which he occupies. It was so written into our law as early as 1807 by Chief Justice Marshall in 1 Burr's Trial 416 . . . .\" \n366 \nU.S., at 722\n.\n\n\n The requirement that a jury's verdict \"must be based upon the evidence developed at the trial\" goes to the fundamental integrity of all that is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by jury.\n10\n \"The jury is an essential instrumentality - an appendage - of the court, the body ordained to pass upon guilt or innocence. Exercise of calm and informed judgment by its members is essential to proper enforcement of law.\" Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 749, 765\n. Mr. Justice Holmes stated no more than a truism when he observed that \"Any judge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms they are extremely likely to be impregnated by the environing atmosphere.\" Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309\n, at 349 (dissenting opinion).\n\nIn the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the \"evidence \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n developed\" against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant's right of confrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel. What happened in this case operated to subvert these basic guarantees of trial by jury. It is to be emphasized that the testimony of Vincent Rispone and Hulon Simmons was not confined to some uncontroverted or merely formal aspect of the case for the prosecution. On the contrary, the credibility which the jury attached to the testimony of these two key witnesses must inevitably have determined whether Wayne Turner was to be sent to his death. To be sure, their credibility was assailed by Turner's counsel through cross-examination in open court. But the potentialities of what went on outside the courtroom during the three days of the trial may well have made these courtroom proceedings little more than a hollow formality. Cf. Rideau v. Louisiana, \n373 \nU.S. 723\n.\n\nIt is true that at the time they testified in open court Rispone and Simmons told the trial judge that they had not talked to the jurors about the case itself. But there is nothing to show what the two deputies discussed in their conversations with the jurors thereafter. And even if it could be assumed that the deputies never did discuss the case directly with any members of the jury, it would be blinking reality not to recognize the extreme prejudice inherent in this continual association throughout the trial between the jurors and these two key witnesses for the prosecution. We deal here not with a brief encounter, but with a continuous and intimate association throughout a three-day trial - an association which gave these witnesses an opportunity, as Simmons put it, to renew old friendships and make new acquaintances among the members of the jury.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt would have undermined the basic guarantees of trial by jury to permit this kind of an association between the jurors and two key prosecution witnesses who were not deputy sheriffs. But the role that Simmons and Rispone played as deputies made the association even more prejudicial. For the relationship was one which could not but foster the jurors' confidence in those who were their official guardians during the entire period of the trial.\n12\n And Turner's fate depended upon how much confidence the jury placed in these two witnesses.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 244 La. 447, 152 So.2d 555.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n376 \nU.S. 949\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Out of the presence of the jury, Turner did testify upon the issue of the voluntariness of his confession, stating among other things that he had had no sleep and nothing to eat for a period of 48 hours before he confessed, but he was not in custody during much of that period. He also stated that he was not advised of his \"legal rights\" before he confessed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"From the moment of the acceptance of any juror until the rendition of verdict or the entry of a mistrial, as the case may be, the jurors shall be kept together under the charge of an officer in such a way as to be secluded from all outside communication; provided that in cases not capital the judge may, in his discretion, permit the jurors to separate at any time before the actual delivery of his charge.\" La. Rev. Stat. 15:394.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In adjourning court after the first day of trial, the judge told the jury: \"Anything that you need you will have to obtain through the Deputy, and any calls that you want to make the Deputies will have to make for you.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Rispone testified in part as follows:\n\n\"Q. Have you been assisting the other Deputies during the course of this trial, in retiring the Jury and in caring for their needs?\n\n\nA. \nI have.\n\n\"Q. As much as any other Deputy on the Sheriff's staff? A. I would say as much.\n\n\n\"Q. Isn't it a fact that you have been sitting in this vicinity through the course of the trial? A.

And some of the things you do yourself? A. That is correct.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] After reciting in detail what had been shown as to Rispone's and Simmons' fraternization with the jurors throughout the trial, the bill of exceptions stated \"that the presence of state's witnesses, whether they be deputies or not, is of itself prejudicial to the constitutional rights of Defendant and violative of due process of law.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The court's opinion did discuss and seemingly rely on a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Odell v. Hudspeth, 189 F.2d 300. In that case, an appeal from a federal district court's denial of habeas corpus to a prisoner convicted in a Kansas court, it was held on facts apparently similar to those in the present case that there had been no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It appears that every state constitution provides for trial by jury. See, e. g., Alaska Const., Art. 1, 11; Idaho Const., Art. 1, 7; Nevada Const., Art. I, 3; North Dakota Const., Art. I, 7; see Columbia University Legislative Drafting Research Fund, Index Digest of State Constitutions, 579 (1959).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Sixth Amendment provides:\n\n\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See note 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See notes 5 and 6, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nIt is with regret that I dissent in this case. If I were sitting on the Supreme Court of Louisiana I would vote to reverse it and do everything possible to put a stop to the practice of permitting an officer who testifies in a case also to be in charge of the jury.\n\nHowever, I cannot say that where no prejudice whatever is shown - as is the case here - the practice reaches federal due process proportions. I understand that it has the approval of the highest courts of a number of other jurisdictions\n1\n and is recognized by Wharton, American Jurisprudence and Corpus Juris Secundum.\n2\n Indeed, in \n\n[379 \nU.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n a similar case from the Tenth Circuit,\n3\n in which this Court denied certiorari in 1951, the court upheld the conviction on the ground that there was no evidence that a testifying sheriff had acted irregularly in performing as custodian of the jury.\n\nIn view of this widespread acceptance of the practice I cannot say that it is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

FIRST NAT. CITY BANK(1965)\nNo. 59\nArgued: November 16, 1964Decided: January 18, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, having made jeopardy assessments of some $19,000,000 against a Uruguayan corporation, served with notices of levy and of federal tax lien respondent bank in New York, in whose Montevideo branch the corporation maintained a deposit. Concurrently, petitioner brought a foreclosure action in Federal District Court against the corporation, respondent, and others, pending determination of which an injunction was sought against transfer by respondent of any property or rights held for the corporation's account. Respondent, but not the corporation, was personally served. The District Court granted a temporary injunction under 26 U.S.C. 7402 (a), which gives district courts power to grant injunctions \"necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws\"; and the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: The District Court has jurisdiction to preserve the status quo and prevent further dissipation of assets by issuing its temporary injunction \"freezing\" the corporation's account in respondent's foreign branch pending personal service on the corporation. Pp. 381-385.\n\n (a) Rules 4 (e) and (f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for service in accordance with a state statute of a non-inhabitant or person not found in the State. P. 381.\n\n\n (b) Under 302 (a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, which became effective after the temporary injunction was issued, out-of-state personal service may be made as provided in 313 on a nondomiciliary transacting business within the State, a remedy which New York law makes applicable to further proceedings, such as are involved here, in an action pending on the effective date of the statute. Pp. 382-383.\n\n\n (c) Issuance of the injunction under 26 U.S.C. 7402 (a) was a proper exercise of the equity power of the District Court, particularly as it was acting in the public interest. P. 383.\n\n\n (d) Respondent's foreign branch was not a \"separate entity\" without the reach of the District Court's in personam order. P. 384. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 379]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (e) The District Court reserved power to enter a protective order upon a showing, though none has been made, that the \"freezing\" of the foreign branch account would violate foreign law or subject respondent to the risk of double liability, and that court is open to any representations which the Executive Branch might make that such \"freezing\" would embarrass this country's foreign relations. P. 384.\n\n\n 325 F.2d 1020, reversed.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Oberdorfer argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox and Harold C. Wilkenfeld.\n\nHenry Harfield argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were William Harvey Reeves and John E. Hoffman, Jr.\n\nRoy C. Haberkern, Jr., and Edward J. Ross filed a brief for the Chase Manhattan Bank et al., as amici curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nTheodore Tannenwald and A. Chauncey Newlin filed a memorandum for Omar, S. A.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents a collateral phase of litigation involving jeopardy assessments of some $19,000,000 made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue against Omar, S. A., a Uruguayan corporation. The assessments charged that income had been realized within the United States on which a tax was due. On the same day respondent was served with notice of levy and notice of the federal tax lien. At the same time petitioner commenced an action in the New York District Court naming Omar, as well as respondent and others, as defendants. Personal jurisdiction over respondent was acquired; but as of the date of argument of the case here, Omar had not yet been served. That action requested, inter alia, foreclosure of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 380]\n\u00a0\n the tax lien upon all of Omar's property, including sums held for the account or credit of Omar in foreign branch offices of respondent.\n1\n It also requested that, pending determination of the action, respondent be enjoined from transferring any property or rights to property held for the account of Omar; and affidavits filed with the complaint averred that Omar was removing its assets from the United States.\n\nThe District Court, on the basis of the affidavits, issued a temporary injunction enjoining respondent from transferring any property or rights to property of Omar now held by it or by any branch offices within or without the United States, indicating it would modify the order should compliance be shown to violate foreign law. 210 F. Supp. 773. The Court of Appeals reversed by a divided vote both by a panel of three, 321 F.2d 14, and en banc, 325 F.2d 1020. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n377 \nU.S. 951\n.\n\nTitle 26 U.S.C. 7402 (a) gives the District Court power to grant injunctions \"necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws.\" Since it has personal jurisdiction over respondent, has it power to grant the interim relief requested? We are advised that respondent's only debt to Omar is payable at respondent's branch in Montevideo. It is said that the United States, the creditor, can assert against respondent in New York only those rights that Omar, the debtor, has against respondent in New York and that under New York law a depositor in a foreign branch has an action against the head office only where there has been a demand and wrongful refusal at the foreign branch. Sokoloff v. National City Bank, 239 N. Y. 158, 145 N. E. 917, 250 \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n N. Y. 69, 164 N. E. 745. The point is emphasized by the argument that any obligation of respondent to Omar is due only in Montevideo - an obligation apparently dischargeable in Uruguayan currency, not in dollars. Therefore, the argument runs, there is no claim of the debtor (Omar) in New York which the creditor can reach.\n\nWe need not consider at this juncture all the refinements of that reasoning. For the narrow issue for us is whether the creditor (the United States) may by injunction pendente lite protect whatever rights the debtor (Omar) may have against respondent who is before the court on personal service. If it were clear that the debtor (Omar) were beyond reach of the District Court so far as personal service is concerned, we would have quite a different case - one on which we intimate no opinion. But under 302 (a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, 7B McKinney's Consol. Laws Ann., 302, personal jurisdiction may be exercised over a \"non-domiciliary\" who \"transacts any business within the state\" as to a cause of action arising out of such transaction, in which event out-of-state personal service may be made as provided in 313.\n2\n The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by Rule 4 (e) and Rule 4 (f) allow a party not an inhabitant of the State or found therein to be served with a summons in a federal court in the manner and under the circumstances prescribed by a state statute.\n3\n See United States v. Montreal Trust Co., 35 F. R. D. 216. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo be sure, this cause of action arose, the complaint was filed, and the temporary injunction was issued before the New York statute became effective. The New York Court of Appeals has, however, indicated that where the suit is instituted after the effective date of the statute, the statute will normally apply to transactions occurring before the effective date. Simonson v. International Bank, 14 N. Y. 2d 281, 290, 200 N. E. 2d 427, 432. That court has further indicated that where, as in the instant case, the suit based on the prior transaction was pending on the effective date of the statute, \"the new act shall - except where it `would not be feasible or would work injustice' - apply `to all further proceedings' in such actions . . . . .\"\n4\n Ibid. It seems obvious that a future attempt by the Government to serve process on Omar would be considered a \"further proceeding\" in the instant litigation. Accordingly, we judge the temporary injunction, which has only a prospective application, as of now and in light of the present remedy which 302 (a) \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n affords.\n5\n And our review of the injunction as an exercise of the equity power granted by 26 U.S.C. 7402 (a) must be in light of the public interest involved: \"Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.\" Virginian R. Co. v. Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n. And see United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 194\n; Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 321, 330\n.\n\nIf personal jurisdiction over Omar is acquired, the creditor (the United States) will be able to collect from respondent what the debtor (Omar) could collect. The opportunity to make that collection should not be lost in limine merely because the debtor (Omar) has not \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n made the agreed-upon demand on respondent at the time and place and in the manner provided in their contract.\n\nWhether the Montevideo branch is a \"separate entity,\" as the Court of Appeals thought, is not germane to the present narrow issue. It is not a separate entity in the sense that it is insulated from respondent's managerial prerogatives. Respondent has actual, practical control over its branches; it is organized under a federal statute, 12 U.S.C. 24, which authorizes it \"To sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law and equity, as fully as natural persons\" - as one entity, not branch by branch. The branch bank's affairs are, therefore, as much within the reach of the in personam order entered by the District Court as are those of the home office. Once personal jurisdiction of a party is obtained, the District Court has authority to order it to \"freeze\" property under its control, whether the property be within or without the United States. See New Jersey v. New York City, \n283 \nU.S. 473, 482\n.\n\nThat is not to say that a federal court in this country should treat all the affairs of a branch bank the same as it would those of the home office. For overseas transactions are often caught in a web of extraterritorial activities and foreign law beyond the ken of our federal courts or their competence. We have, however, no such involvement here, for there is no showing that the mere \"freezing\" of the Montevideo accounts, pending service on Omar, would violate foreign law, cf. Societe Internationale v. Rogers, \n357 \nU.S. 197, 211\n, or place respondent under any risk of double liability. Cf. Western Union Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n368 \nU.S. 71\n. The District Court reserved power to enter any protective order of that character. 210 F. Supp. 773, 775. And if, as is argued in dissent, the litigation might in time be embarrassing to United States diplomacy, the District Court remains open \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n to the Executive Branch, which, it must be remembered, is the moving party in the present proceeding.\n\nThe temporary injunction issued by the District Court seems to us to be eminently appropriate to prevent further dissipation of assets. See United States v. Morris & Essex R. Co., 135 F.2d 711, 713-714. If such relief were beyond the authority of the District Court, foreign taxpayers facing jeopardy assessments might either transfer assets abroad or dissipate those in foreign accounts under control of American institutions before personal service on the foreign taxpayer could be made. Such a scheme was underfoot here, the affidavits aver. Unlike De Beers Mines v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 212\n, there is here property which would be \"the subject of the provisions of any final decree in the cause.\" Id., 220. We conclude that this temporary injunction is \"a reasonable measure to preserve the status quo\" (Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., \n311 \nU.S. 282, 290\n) pending service of process on Omar and an adjudication of the merits.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These branches are not separate corporations but parts of respondent's single, federally chartered corporation. See 12 U.S.C. 601-604; First National City Bank v. Internal Revenue Service, 271 F.2d 616.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There is also of course the possibility that Omar might enter a general appearance as it apparently did in the Tax Court when it filed its petition of May 20, 1963, for a redetermination of the deficiencies on the basis of which the present jeopardy assessments were made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 4 (e), effective July 1, 1963, reads in relevant part:\n\n\"Whenever a statute or rule of court of the state in which the district court is held provides (1) for service of a summons, or of a notice, or of an order in lieu of summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, or (2) for service upon or notice \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n to him to appear and respond or defend in an action by reason of the attachment or garnishment or similar seizure of his property located within the state, service may in either case be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute or rule.\"\n\n\n Rule 4 (f), also effective July 1, 1963, reads in relevant part:\n\n\"All process other than a subpoena may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of the state in which the district court is held, and, when authorized by a statute of the United States or by these rules, beyond the territorial limits of that state.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals reached these conclusions on the basis of Civil Practice Law and Rules, 10003, 7B McKinney's Consol. Laws Ann., 10003: \"This act shall apply to all actions hereafter commenced. This act shall also apply to all further proceedings in pending actions, except to the extent that the court determines that application in a particular pending action would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former procedure applies. Proceedings pursuant to law in an action taken prior to the time this act takes effect shall not be rendered ineffectual or impaired by this act.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] That the Government has not yet attempted to obtain personal jurisdiction over Omar is not significant in light of the fact that until now the Government's primary contention has been that the District Court's personal jurisdiction over the respondent bank was by itself an adequate basis for the issuance of the temporary injunction. As the Government said in its petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals: \"The jurisdictional basis, then, for the injunction issued by the District Court was personal jurisdiction over the Bank. Certainly, at this stage of the proceeding, it is inconsequential whether the District Court has jurisdiction over a res or over the taxpayer.\" The Government went on to say that if this contention was rejected, then it wished to argue that the tax lien had attached to Omar's deposits and that these deposits \"constitute rights to property which were within the jurisdiction of the District Court.\" Finally the Government stated: \"It is only in the event that the Court concludes that the lien does not attach to such deposits that personal jurisdiction over Omar becomes relevant. In such event the Government should be afforded an opportunity to obtain personal jurisdiction over Omar and the injunction should stand pending such efforts.\" Even before this Court the Government argues alternatively that \"the District Court had authority to enter the temporary injunction to preserve funds over which it had jurisdiction quasi in rem,\" a contention upon which, as noted previously, we do not pass.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court's opinion reflects an expansive view of the jurisdiction of a federal court to tie up foreign owned and situated property with which I cannot agree.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service first focused on Omar, S. A., a Uruguayan corporation, in 1959 when Omar filed a return seeking a $10,000 credit from a regulated investment company. Investigation of this relatively small refund claim revealed the possibility that in fact Omar owed a very substantial amount in taxes to the Government. Omar maintained accounts with several New York securities brokers, and purchase and sale orders \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n communicated from abroad had resulted in the realization of large profits. The lawyer acting for Omar contended that these transactions gave rise to no tax liability because Omar was not a personal holding company. In a meeting with the investigating agent in May 1962, the lawyer warned that if the Service persisted in its attempt to tax Omar as a personal holding company, \"Omar would quite likely liquidate its holdings in the United States, and send the money out of the country.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Service did persist. On October 31, 1962, it issued jeopardy assessments against Omar totaling $19,300,000, and on the same day filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of New York naming as defendants Omar, the brokerage houses with which Omar had dealt, and several banks including the First National City Bank (hereinafter Citibank) which is the respondent here. By this time Omar had in large part succeeded in liquidating its securities and transferring the funds out of the country. Some of the funds were apparently transferred to Citibank's branch in Montevideo, Uruguay, and were on deposit there on the day the complaint was filed. As part of the relief sought, the Government asked the District Court to \"freeze\" this account (we are not informed as to its size) until such time as personal jurisdiction could be obtained over Omar. Citibank contested the authority of the court to make such an order on the ground that the account had its situs in Montevideo and was therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Personal jurisdiction over Omar had not been obtained at the time the complaint was filed, and has not been obtained in the two years since. Omar is thus not a party to the present litigation. Personal jurisdiction over Citibank was obtained by service upon its home office at 55 Wall Street, New York City. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe issue presented by the case is: Did the Federal District Court have jurisdiction to freeze the account in Montevideo by enjoining Citibank from transferring any property or rights to property held therein for Omar? The Government argues that jurisdiction could stem from either of two sources: jurisdiction quasi in rem over the debt owing from Citibank's Montevideo branch to Omar; or personal jurisdiction over Citibank, which is capable of controlling the debt even though its situs may be outside the court's jurisdiction. Despite its enigmatic and unsupported statement that \"there is here property which would be `the subject of the provisions of any final decree in the cause,'\" ante, p. 385, the Court does not decide the quasi in rem issue on which the District Court relied. The opinion rests entirely on the personal jurisdiction theory. Both theories are, in my view, demonstrably insufficient.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL JURISDICTION.\n\n\n The Court upholds the freeze order on the basis that the District Court, pending acquisition of personal jurisdiction over Omar, had authority to enjoin Citibank (over which it did have personal jurisdiction) from allowing its Montevideo branch to transfer the funds to Omar.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the enforcement powers available to the District Court were adequate to accomplish that much of the end in view. Citibank was before the court. It had sufficient control over the Montevideo branch to require compliance with the freeze order, and if it did not exercise that control, the sanctions of contempt could be inflicted on officers and property of Citibank within the New York district.\n2\n But \"jurisdiction\" is not \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n synonymous with naked power. It is a combination of power and policy. Judge Learned Hand made this point in Amey v. Colebrook Guaranty Sav. Bank, 92 F.2d 62, a case containing some of the same elements as the case before us. In reversing so much of an interlocutory decree of a federal judge sitting in Vermont as provided for the cutting of timber in Maine, Judge Hand said:\n\n \"The word, `jurisdiction,' is in this connection somewhat equivocal; in one sense the judge had it; the bank had personally appeared and was subject to his orders, as far as any corporation can be; he might sequester its property in Vermont, if he could find any, or he might proceed against its officers as for a contempt. But although he thus had the power to prevent the defendant from asserting its rights in Maine, it might still be improper for him to do so. Courts do not always exert themselves to the full, or direct parties to do all that they can effectively compel, and such forbearance is sometimes called lack of `jurisdiction.' What reserves a court shall make, when dealing with real property beyond its territory, is not altogether plain; as to some things, it will act freely when it has before it those who hold the legal interests.\" 92 F.2d, at 63.\n\n\n The real problem with this phase of the case is therefore this: Granting that the District Court had the naked power to control the Montevideo account by bringing to bear coercive action on Citibank, ought the court to have exercised it? Or to put the question in the statutory terms,\n3\n was the court's order \"appropriate\" for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws? \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Need for Personal Jurisdiction Over Omar.\n\n\n We should first consider the question in its starkest form. Assuming that there is no quasi in rem jurisdiction over the property (see Part IV, infra, p. 404) and no reasonable likelihood of obtaining personal jurisdiction over Omar, why should the court not use its naked power, to the extent that it could be brought to bear on others situated as was Citibank, to tie up Omar's property all over the world for the avowed purpose of coercing Omar into paying its taxes?\n\nUse of judicial equity powers to coerce a party over whom the court has no jurisdiction or likelihood of obtaining jurisdiction is unheard of. The statute authorizing courts to render such decrees as may be \"necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws\" clearly intends that courts use only their traditional equity powers to that end.\n4\n It should not be interpreted as an authorization to employ radically new and extremely far-reaching forms of coercive action in a more free-wheeling approach to international than to domestic cases.\n5\n Neither the Government nor the Court argues for such an extraordinary judicial use of power. Suffice it to say that if the contrary position were taken, serious constitutional problems would arise. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. \nImprobability of Obtaining Personal Jurisdiction Over Omar as of the Time the Injunction Was Issued.\n\nIt is basic to traditional notions of equity that to justify the issuance of a protective temporary injunction there must exist a substantial probability that jurisdiction, judgment, and enforcement will be obtained with respect to the person sought to be affected.\n6\n The Court does not and could not contest this proposition, and virtually concedes that at the time the injunction was issued, the Government had insufficient probability of obtaining personal jurisdiction over Omar to justify the issuance of the freeze order. Section 302 (a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, upon which the Court alone relies, did not become effective until 10 months later.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nNo other theory is offered by the Court which could justify the freeze order as of the time at which it was issued.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 391]\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. Evaluating the Injunction \"as of now.\"\n\n\n The only course left open to the Court on its theory of the case is to judge the injunction \"as of now.\" Indeed the New York Court of Appeals ruled in Simonson v. International Bank, 14 N. Y. 2d 281, 200 N. E. 2d 427, that 302 (a) does not retroactively validate actions in pending cases taken before its enactment, and may be applied to further proceedings in pending cases only if it is equitable to do so.\n9\n Thus even on the glib assumption that New York courts would interpret 302 (a) to give personal jurisdiction over one who merely traded long \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 392]\n\u00a0\n distance for his own account on the New York exchanges,\n10\n the Court must nonetheless show, as a matter of both state and federal law, that there is equity in continuing the existence of the freeze order. There are two inescapable reasons why such a showing is impossible.\n\n(a) The so-called \"temporary\" freeze order has now been in effect for over two years. During this time no form of jurisdiction over Omar has been obtained. It may be argued that it is this appellate review which has been the cause of delay. But Omar is not party to this review. The contesting parties are the Government and Citibank. Nothing pertaining to these proceedings precluded or excused the Government from obtaining personal jurisdiction over Omar and proceeding with the case if it was otherwise able to do so. As far as Omar is concerned, its property has been taken from its control by a court having jurisdiction neither over the corporation nor over the property (see Part IV, infra, p. 404), prior to any judgment of liability being entered against it, and during a time when the Uruguayan peso has fallen over 60%.\n11\n The Government had its chance to reach Omar's property before it was removed from the country. Indeed, it was warned (supra, p. 386), and made no legal move until several months later. It made no effort to obtain personal jurisdiction over Omar within a reasonable time after the \"temporary\" injunction was issued; or after 302 (a) was enacted; or after the date at which it supposedly altered the theory on which it chose to argue \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 393]\n\u00a0\n its case. The Court expresses the opinion that this latter event, obviously irrelevant to the equities of Omar and Citibank, somehow explains and excuses the Government's failure to have acquired personal jurisdiction over Omar. This is surely untenable. The petition for rehearing was filed on July 10, 1963, following the initial Court of Appeals' opinion and prior to the opinion of the court en banc. Over 18 months have elapsed since that time. Were this in itself not conclusive, the Government stated unequivocally and as its very first ground for rehearing:\n\n\"The United States, which in this action seeks inter alia a judgment in personam against Omar, is taking necessary steps to effectuate personal jurisdiction over Omar.\"\n\n\n In the face of this statement there is no way that the Court can excuse or avoid the fact that the Government, by reason of either neglect or inability, has failed to acquire jurisdiction over Omar in the ample time which has been available to it. Yet the Court inexplicably finds equity in continuing the freeze order.\n12\n Omar, as a foreign corporation which allegedly withdrew its assets to avoid taxation by this country, naturally does not present a sympathetic aspect to this Court, but that is no justification for perpetuating a \"temporary\" order which, without any jurisdictional basis, has tied up Omar's \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 394]\n\u00a0\n property for over two years.\n13\n Alleged tax dodgers, as much as those charged with crime, are entitled to due process treatment. And the hand of equity should be stayed long before it reaches constitutional limits.\n\n(b) Whether the situation is examined as of the time the order originally issued or as of now, the Government has to show that the funds to be frozen may be subject to ultimate execution. If the property cannot be subjected to government levy, there is obviously no equity in freezing it. That is the situation presented here. The quasi in rem statute does not permit the court to attach the property directly (see Part IV, infra, p. 404), and no view is expressed by the Court as to how or whether this difficulty could be avoided.\n\nThe Government argues that this obstacle can be skirted in the following fashion. Personal jurisdiction under 302 can be obtained over Omar by mailing a \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 395]\n\u00a0\n letter to Uruguay pursuant to New York's substituted service statute.\n14\n Judgment can then be obtained together with an order to Omar to transfer the funds in the Montevideo account to the Government. When Omar refuses to comply voluntarily - it has no officers in New York who could be punished for contempt - a court officer appointed under Rule 70 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure could be sent to Montevideo to make demand upon the Citibank branch in the name of the United States.\n15\n If the branch refuses payment, it will breach its contract to pay on demand. An action for breach of the contract could then be brought by the depositor against Citibank in New York (see n. 27, infra). Once that obligation accrues in New York, the Government can garnish it to satisfy the personal judgment. Of course, if the court could directly order Citibank in New York to pay the debt, the obligation would be payable \"within the district\" (see Part IV, infra, p. 404), in which case the quasi in rem statute would serve without necessitating elaborate personal jurisdiction theories.\n\nThe reasons why this procedural cake-walking should not commend itself are manifest. Foreign courts in customary \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 396]\n\u00a0\n international practice (which Uruguay presumably follows) do not enforce foreign tax judgments.\n16\n Therefore Uruguay would undoubtedly not consider valid a demand made by the court-appointed officer for the property within Uruguayan borders. If the refusal to pay the court officer is proper under the Uruguayan law which governs the contract, there can be no breach which would give rise to a cause of action in New York, Zimmermann v. Sutherland, \n274 \nU.S. 253\n.\n\nFurthermore the prospect is more than startling that a district court, aware that a foreign country would not enforce its judgment, would nonetheless dispatch a court officer to the foreign jurisdiction to accomplish that end by self-help.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n  THE DE BEERS AND DECKERT CASES.\n\n\n It is surprising that the Court has been content to so cursorily lay aside De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 212\n, for upon examination that case will be found to be indistinguishable from the present case and should control this litigation on the personal jurisdiction issue.\n\nThe United States brought a Sherman antitrust action against De Beers and other African-based diamond companies alleging monopolization and conspiracy in restraint of trade. All were allegedly doing business within the United States. With the complaint the Government requested a preliminary injunction freezing all property in the United States belonging to the defendants. As stated in the opinion, the reasons given in support of the motion were:\n\n \"`The injury to the United States of America from the withdrawal of said deposits, diamonds or other property would be irreparable because sequestration of said property is the only means of enforcing this Court's orders or decree against said foreign corporate defendants. The principal business of said defendants is carried on in foreign countries and they could quickly withdraw their assets from the United States and so prevent enforcement of any order or decree which this Court may render.'\n\n\n \"Amongst other supporting papers was an affidavit by counsel for the United States which stated that `the investigation which he has made shows the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 398]\n\u00a0\n foreign corporate defendants named herein have endeavored to avoid subjecting themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States by making their sales abroad only and requiring customers to pay in advance for all purchases.'\" \n325 \nU.S., at 215\n-216.\n\n\n Under the Sherman Act district courts had power \"to prevent and restrain violations of this act\" (26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 4 (1958 ed.)), and, under the \"all-writs\" section of the Judicial Code, to \"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law\" (now 28 U.S.C. 1651 (1958 ed.)). The Court construed these grants of authority as limited to traditional equitable powers. It then demonstrated the remoteness of any levy by the Government against the property of the defendants, and because of the remoteness vacated the freeze order. It should be noted that unlike the present case the property sought to be frozen was within the borders of the United States, and, that without a hold on it, an order to the defendants to stop their alleged monopolistic practices would have been as little likely to meet with voluntary compliance as an order to Omar to pay $19,300,000.\n\nThe Government would distinguish De Beers on the ground that under the Sherman Act the trial court could award only injunctive relief, whereas in the present case the judgment, were the Government successful, would be a money award. However, the De Beers Court recognized that levy against the property could ultimately be had as a means of enforcing the injunctive order. Clearly the Court's point in emphasizing the scope of the order which could issue in the first instance was that the possibility of an ultimate levy was too remote in practical terms to justify freezing the property from the outset of the litigation. Remoteness is the determinative point, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 399]\n\u00a0\n whatever its cause, and in terms of remoteness the case before us argues even stronger than De Beers against the issuance of what amounts to an interim sequestration order. The principles of De Beers should govern this litigation.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government puts forth Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., \n311 \nU.S. 282\n, instead of De Beers as the case most analogous to the present one. In Deckert a bill in equity was brought against an insolvent and allegedly fraudulent securities vendor and against a third party who held assets of the vendor. By way of interlocutory relief the plaintiffs asked that the assets in the hands of the third party be frozen, and this Court sustained the request. Distinguishing features are many. Deckert involved no international problems. The court had personal jurisdiction over all parties concerned. There was no question of power to enforce a judgment against the frozen funds. The only contingency on which enforcement depended was whether the plaintiff would win the suit; thus, there was virtually no problem of remoteness. And unlike the present case (see infra, pp. 404-409), the frozen funds could have been attached directly by a suit quasi in rem in a state court.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 400]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n THE OVERALL BALANCE OF EQUITIES AND CONSIDERATIONS   AFFECTING JURISDICTION.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\n Certainly the Court's remark that it must act in light of the \"public interest\" cannot mean that because the Government is a party here, the Court may ignore its duty to consider the balance of equities. It is, therefore, well to consider just what overall benefits will accrue in the public interest as a result of today's decision.\n\nExcept in the context of the comparatively rare case in which the Government has the element of surprise on its side, it must be recognized that the utility of the extra-territorial freeze order as a tax-collecting weapon is minimal. Under the tax regulation adopted during this action the Government declares that it would use the freeze-order power to reach only funds which were transferred out of this country in order to hinder or delay the collection of taxes and which were in banks having an American office.\n21\n In other words, the regulation would \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 401]\n\u00a0\n snare only those taxpayers smart and unscrupulous enough to withdraw their funds from the United States, but stupid and uninformed enough, even after this decision, to put the transferred funds in a bank having a United States office. In order to provide the Government with this toy pistol, the Court flexes its muscles in a manner never before imagined.\n\nIf the overall benefits of this exercise of power are minimal, the detriments are substantial.\n\n(a) It would expose Citibank, an innocent stakeholder, to exactly the kind of administrative hazards which New York's \"separate entity\" theory is designed to obviate.\n\n(b) It would subject Citibank to the possibility of double liability if Uruguay did not recognize the United \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 402]\n\u00a0\n States' judgment, and multiple liability if Uruguay permitted actions for slander of credit. The District Court's offer to modify the freeze order if Citibank shows that it conflicts with Uruguayan law is some hedge against the first of these dangers, but operating at its best it places the heavy burden on Citibank, blameless in this situation, of discovering Uruguayan law. In practical operation the Uruguayan law may well be unclear to the point that Citibank can only be sure of its obligation to Omar if it is sued for payment and the matter is litigated. If Omar is loath to sue for one reason or another (it may fear that its demand for the money and the bank's refusal to pay it will cause the obligation to become payable in New York), it may be impossible for Citibank to establish Uruguayan law before it is too late. If the Government manages to levy on the account, and only afterwards is it established that the bank was liable to Omar, Citibank would be left to sue the United States for recoupment, an eventuality for which no provision has been made and which the Government stated at the oral argument of this case that it would oppose.\n\n(c) Citibank alleges that its foreign banking business will be hurt because foreign depositors will be discouraged from using United States banks for fear that their funds can be reached by United States courts. There is no sure way to gauge the seriousness of this possibility, but since Citibank is an innocent stakeholder here, doubt should be resolved in its favor.\n\n(d) The Uruguay Code of Civil Procedure provides, in rough translation:\n\n Art. 511. Judgments rendered in foreign states shall have in the Republic [Uruguay] the effect prescribed by applicable treaties.\n\n\n Art. 512. If there are not treaties with the nation in which they are rendered, they shall have the same \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 403]\n\u00a0\n effect which by the laws of that nation, it would give to the decrees rendered in the Republic.\n\n\n Art. 513. If the judgment proceeds from a nation in which by its jurisprudence, it would not give effect to the decrees of the Tribunals of the Republic, they [sic] shall have no force here.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\n When Omar sues Citibank in Montevideo for its account, Citibank will plead the United States decree as a defense, and the Court speculates that Uruguay will give it effect (ante, pp. 384-385). In light of Uruguay's reciprocity principle the Court's decision implicitly signifies that our courts would recognize a similar order by a Uruguayan court.\n23\n Operating under a tax regulation similar to that adopted by the Government, a Uruguayan court with jurisdiction over the Montevideo branch of Citibank could freeze accounts in New York.\n24\n I am extremely reluctant to uphold such a power. The freeze orders of the type in question here issue prior to any court judgment, indeed before any significant proceedings at all. A nation asked to recognize such a freeze order will have virtually nothing to go on but the bare request. The propriety of the decree does not even rest on the reliability of the foreign court, as is the usual case in judgment recognition problems,\n25\n but on the reliability of the foreign taxing authorities, something a domestic court has no way of judging.\n\nThe Court should not lose sight of the fact that our modern notions of substituted service and personal jurisdiction \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 404]\n\u00a0\n were developed within a framework of States whose various processes are governed by the Due Process Clause and whose judgments must be given full faith and credit by the other States within the federal structure. Great care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field, both as a basis for asserting federal judicial power with respect to property in foreign countries and for permitting property in this country to be tied up by foreign courts.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n   QUASI IN REM JURISDICTION.\n\n\n There remains for consideration the quasi in rem issue which the Government argues but which the Court chooses not to decide. Whether the District Court had quasi in rem jurisdiction turns on whether Omar had property or rights to property within the Southern District of New York to which a federal lien could attach.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 405]\n\u00a0\n Under New York law, Omar had only a conditional right to payment in New York in the event that a demand made upon the Montevideo branch where the account is maintained was wrongfully refused, Sokoloff v. National City Bank, 250 N. Y. 69, 164 N. E. 745;\n27\n and two recent decisions by this Court establish that it is New York law which here determines the nature and existence of property rights for federal tax lien purposes.\n\nIn United States v. Bess, \n357 \nU.S. 51\n, the taxpayer died leaving income taxes unpaid for a prior year. Several life insurance policies were part of his estate. The Court said:\n\n\"We must now decide whether Mr. Bess possessed in his lifetime, within the meaning of 3670, any `property' or `rights to property' in the insurance policies to which the perfected lien for the 1946 taxes might attach. Since 3670 creates no property \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 406]\n\u00a0\n rights but merely attaches consequences, federally defined, to rights created under state law, . . . we must look first to Mr. Bess' right in the policies as defined by state law.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 55\n.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n\n Since Bess had had no right to the proceeds of the policies during his lifetime, no federal tax lien could have attached to them. But Bess could have drawn on the cash surrender value; thus under state law he had \"rights to property\" during his lifetime to that extent. However, it was also true under state law that no creditor was permitted to attach the cash surrender value of the policies. In answer to the contention that the Government should be treated no differently than any other creditor, the Court said:\n\n\"[O]nce it has been determined that state law creates sufficient interests in the insured to satisfy the requirements of 3670, state law is inoperative to prevent the attachment of liens created by federal statutes in favor of the United States.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 56\n-57.\n\n\n On the basis of this analysis - that state law creates property rights, but federal law determines whether liens should attach to them - the Court concluded that the lien could be enforced against the beneficiary of the policies to the extent of the cash surrender value.\n\nEven under Bess an argument could be made for permitting a federal lien in this instance to attach in New \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 407]\n\u00a0\n York. New York law, which treats branch banks as separate entities and makes Omar's account payable in the first instance only in Montevideo, was developed primarily to meet the problems created by ordinary garnishing creditors, and arguably has no application to a claim by the United States. But the Court, in Aquilino v. United States, \n363 \nU.S. 509\n, chose to accept state property law just as it found it, and not to evaluate its underlying rationale in light of the needs of federal revenue collection. There the Government sued a general contractor who had defaulted both on the payment of federal taxes and on the payment of amounts due to subcontractors with mechanics' liens. Money payable by the property owner to the general contractor was the subject of the suit. The subcontractors contended that under New York lien law the general contractor had \"mere title\" to the contested fund, holding it in trust for the subcontractors; thus, it was argued, he himself had no right to the property within the meaning of the federal lien statute. In remanding the case to determine if the New York law was as the subcontractors contended, the Court indicated it would accept this argument despite the fact that the only practical effect that New York's definition of the general contractor's property rights could have would be to control which creditors prevailed against the property. (See my dissenting opinion, \n363 \nU.S., at 516\n.) The Court said:\n\n\"The application of state law in ascertaining the taxpayer's property rights and of federal law in reconciling the claims of competing lienors is based both upon logic and sound legal principles. This approach strikes a proper balance between the legitimate and traditional interest which the State has in creating and defining the property interest of its citizens, and the necessity for a uniform administration of the federal revenue statutes.\" \n363 \nU.S., at 514\n. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 408]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The State of New York has determined that branch banks should be treated as separate entities, primarily in order to avoid the crippling effects which could result from requiring each branch to be aware of and liable to make payments to depositors and garnishing creditors on accounts maintained in other branches.\n29\n If New York, based upon this policy, has determined that Omar has no immediate right to payment in New York, federal lien law, under Bess and Aquilino, cannot create one. The rule of those cases would not, I think, go so far as to allow an incidental contract provision adopted by two contracting parties simply for their own convenience to thwart the operation of federal lien law - for instance, an agreement that the parties would meet at a certain place to consummate their transaction - but in the present case the policy determination has been made by the State, not by private parties, and cannot be treated as incidental. The only right to property which New York recognizes in Omar is the conditional right to payment predicated on a wrongful refusal in Montevideo. The Government can, of course, levy on that conditional right, but the satisfaction it will derive from doing so is obviously limited.\n\nThe Government seeks to analogize various insurance company cases in which liens are permitted to attach to the cash surrender value of policies despite a contract condition that the policyholder must surrender his policy in order to collect.\n30\n It is contended that just as federal courts can override the requirement of policy surrender, they can override the requirement of demand and wrongful refusal in Montevideo. The insurance cases, however, are readily distinguishable. The policy \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 409]\n\u00a0\n surrender requirement is of the order of an incidental rule of contract between two private contracting parties; indeed, it has been characterized as a housekeeping detail.\n31\n And if the purpose of requiring surrender of an insurance policy is to protect the company against suit at some later time, a court decree would fully satisfy it. The District Court guaranteed and could guarantee Citibank no such protection from suit by Omar.\n\nIn conclusion on the quasi in rem branch of this case, it should be remembered that it is a statute which we are interpreting.\n32\n Section 1655, 28 U.S.C., pertaining to \"Lien enforcement; absent defendants,\" provides for quasi in rem jurisdiction in federal district courts over property \"within the district.\" Courts of other countries would recognize that the situs of the Omar account was in Montevideo.\n33\n Courts of New York State would so hold,\n34\n and where, as here, the common understanding would be that the situs of an account payable to a Uruguayan corporation in Montevideo is in Montevideo, we should not indulge a wholly novel interpretation of the governing statute.\n\n    CONCLUSION.\n\n\n The only case cited by the Court relating to injunctions involving property outside the United States is New Jersey v. New York City, \n283 \nU.S. 473\n, in which this Court enjoined New York City from dumping its garbage \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 410]\n\u00a0\n in the sea off the coast of New Jersey.\n35\n In the face of this slender reed stands De Beers, basically indistinguishable from the case at bar, plus the powerful equitable considerations enumerated above. The clear preponderance of the competing considerations leads to the conclusion that the issuance of this freeze order was not \"appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws\" ( 7402 (a), n. 3, supra), and therefore that the District Court, even though it possessed the naked power to act as it did, had no \"jurisdiction\" (ibid.) to issue the challenged order. The same result follows even if naked power be considered as synonymous with jurisdiction (a proposition which for me is wholly unacceptable) for in that event the action of the District Court must be regarded as entailing an abuse of discretion of such magnitude and mischievous radiations in our general jurisprudence as to make the order a proper subject of review by this Court under its supervisory powers.\n36\n\u00a0\n\nWhile I have the utmost sympathy with the Government's efforts to protect the revenue, I do not think the course it has taken here can be sustained without extending federal court jurisdiction beyond permissible limits.\n\nI vote to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Affidavit of William R.

Section 302 provides:\n\n\"(a) Acts which are the basis of jurisdiction. A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary, or his executor or administrator, as to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section, in the same manner as if he were a domiciliary of the state, if, in person or through an agent, he:\n\n\n\"1. transacts any business within the state; or\n\n\n\"2. commits a tortious act within the state, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act; or\n\n\n\"3. owns, uses or possesses any real property situated within the state.\n\n\n\"(b) Effect of appearance. Where personal jurisdiction is based solely upon this section, an appearance does not confer such jurisdiction with respect to causes of action not arising from an act enumerated in this section.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The lame suggestion is made by the Government that Omar would voluntarily make a general appearance to defend the suit. In light of the fact that Omar had quite evidently purposefully withdrawn \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 391]\n\u00a0\n most of its property from the jurisdiction, including the property here in question, an appearance voluntarily putting this very property in jeopardy would have been most surprising. The Government makes the further argument that Omar might have attempted to make a limited appearance to contest the title to some other property over which the District Court had clear quasi in rem jurisdiction (an account with Lehman Bros. in New York has been attached); and since the limited appearance might not be recognized, but instead treated as a general appearance, personal jurisdiction would be obtained. (There is a split of authority as to whether limited appearances are permitted. See United States v. Balanovski, 236 F.2d 298 (C. A. 2d Cir.), cert. denied, \n352 \nU.S. 968\n, and cases cited therein. See also Developments in the Law: State-Court Jurisdiction, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 909, 953 (1960).) Whether or not a rule against limited appearances should prevail in our federal courts, it is clear that no argument for having such a rule could extend so far as to authorize a court, by reason of its having quasi in rem jurisdiction over one piece of property, to use whatever naked power is at its command to freeze all property wherever located, which could conceivably be affected by a personal judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Simonson involved a suit brought in 1960 in New York against an Arizona bank. The trial court held that there was no personal jurisdiction over the defendant under existing statutes. By the time the plaintiff's appeal on this issue reached the Court of Appeals, 302 had become effective and appellant tried to rely on it. The court held that 302 did not retroactively apply to validate the service that had been made upon the Arizona bank, and affirmed the dismissal of the complaint.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Simonson v. International Bank, 14 N. Y. 2d 281, 288, 200 N. E. 2d 427, 431; Purdy Co. v. Argentina, 333 F.2d 95, cert. denied, \n379 \nU.S. 962\n (decided under the Illinois statute on which 302 was patterned).

Times, Jan. 11, 1965, p. 37, col. 4.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Court's very assertion that the Government changed its theory is belied by the statement, prominently featured in the petition for rehearing, that \"The Government contended in the brief heretofore filed in this Court that there is every likelihood that personal jurisdiction over Omar can be effectuated . . . .\" Of course, the Government argued alternative theories below just as it has done here. The statements quoted by the Court (gleaned from a footnote) indicate only that the Government (rightly, I think) regarded the personal jurisdiction argument as its weaker point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Government's delay in obtaining personal jurisdiction is particularly significant because of the unknowns and imponderables with which the case in its present posture is saturated. Thus, we have no firm indication of what Uruguayan law is with respect to any aspect of this action, no indication of the effect freeze orders would have on this country's banking interests, and Omar, the foreign taxpayer whose interests are most at stake, is not before the Court. Can it be doubted that a decision upon the propriety of the novel use of judicial power here involved could be much better made if the issue were presented in a context with some of the unknowns removed? Had the Government not delayed but, instead, proceeded (if possible) to acquire personal jurisdiction over Omar, and then judgment and execution (if possible) against the Montevideo account, the case could come before us with most of this opaqueness removed. Omar could have presented the issue of the validity of the freeze order as a defense to an ultimate levy upon the account; the issue would not be moot at that stage because there would have been no earlier time at which Omar could have attacked the order without running the risk of being subjected to the personal jurisdiction of the court, and, as a matter of sound judicial principle, the Government should not be permitted to levy successfully upon the account when its ability to do so stems from an improper freeze order.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Section 313 of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules provides:\n\n\"A person domiciled in the state or subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state under section 301 or 302, or his executor or administrator, may be served with the summons without the state, in the same manner as service is made within the state, by any person authorized to make service within the state who is a resident of the state or by any person authorized to make service by the laws of the state, territory, possession or country in which service is made or by any duly qualified attorney, solicitor, barrister, or equivalent in such jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Rule 70 provides in relevant part:\n\n\"If a judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance of land or to deliver deeds or other documents or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court and the act when so done has like effect as if done by the party.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] United States v.

Law 34 (1959).\n\nThe Court derives support for such a bizarre procedure from the fact that \"the District Court remains open to the Executive Branch\" (ante, pp. 384-385). But certainly the Court cannot justify a procedure \n\n[379 \nU.S. 378, 397]\n\u00a0\n at odds with proper international practice simply because the Executive has not expressed a contrary wish.\n\nI doubt very much whether before today's decision even our own State Department would have found it easy to lend its aid, by way of issuing a passport or otherwise, to such a novel international adventure.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Court places reliance on New Jersey v. New York City, \n283 \nU.S. 473\n, an inapposite case in which the Court enjoined New York City from taking its garbage out to sea and dumping it off the New Jersey coast. No international problem was involved, nor any question of personal jurisdiction, enforcement, or rights of third parties. The garbage left our territorial jurisdiction on a circular route calculated to return it in an offensive manner. The Court had clear jurisdiction to prevent it from beginning that journey.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This last feature was heavily relied upon in United States v. Morris & Essex R. Co., 135 F.2d 711, a tax case in which the tax-lien statute could have been used directly.\n\nPrior to the recent amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (see Rule 4 (e)), a federal district court could not obtain quasi in rem jurisdiction over a debt owed to an absent defendant. Big Vein Coal Co. v. Read, \n229 \nU.S. 31\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Those policy considerations which enter into a jurisdictional determination once it is decided that naked power exists are those which would apply in the generality of cases raising the jurisdictional question. Those considerations which are peculiar to this case relate to the question whether, in this instance, jurisdiction, once established, should be exercised.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The regulation provides:\n\n 26 CFR 301.6332-1 (as amended by T.

The notice of levy shall not specify that the district director intends to reach such deposits unless the district director believes -\n\n\n\"(i) That the taxpayer is within the jurisdiction of a United States court at the time the levy is made and that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office of the bank outside the United States or a possession of the United States; or\n\n\n\"(ii) That the taxpayer is not within the jurisdiction of a United States court at the time the levy is made, that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office outside the United States or a possession of the United States, and that such deposits consist, in whole or in part, of funds transferred from the United States or a possession of the United States in order to hinder or delay the collection of a tax imposed by the Code.\n\n\n\"For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `possession of the United States' includes Guam, the Midway Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Codigo de Procedimiento Civil (Couture, 1952).

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAt issue in this case is the effect of Executive Order No. 8979 and Public Land Order No. 487 upon the Secretary of the Interior's authority to issue oil and gas leases.\n\nBetween October 15, 1954, and January 28, 1955, D. J. Griffin and other persons - hereinafter collectively referred to as the Griffin lessees - filed applications for oil and gas leases on approximately 25,000 acres located in the Kenai National Moose Range in Alaska. On August 14, 1958, the respondents filed offers to lease the same lands. Section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provides, in relevant part, that \"the person first making application for the lease who is qualified to hold a lease . . . shall be entitled to a lease of such lands without competitive bidding. . . .\" 41 Stat. 443 (1920), as amended by 60 Stat. 951 (1946), 30 U.S.C. 226 (1958 ed.). The Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior determined that the Griffin lessees were the persons who had applied first, and issued to them leases on the tracts, effective September 1, 1958. Respondents' applications were reached for processing in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n October 1959, and were rejected on the ground that the lands had been leased to prior applicants.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the rejection of their applications, respondents appealed to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management and then to the Secretary of the Interior, both of whom affirmed the decision. 68 I. D. 256 (1961). Respondents then brought an action in the nature of mandamus, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to compel the Secretary to issue oil and gas leases to them. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary dismissing the complaint. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that Executive Order No. 8979, the order creating the Moose Range in 1941, and Public Land Order No. 487, issued by the Secretary in 1948,\n2\n had withdrawn the lands in controversy from availability for leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act, and that the lands remained closed to leasing until they were reopened by a revised departmental regulation on August 14, 1958. The court therefore held that the Griffin applications, filed while the land was closed, were ineffective, rendering the leases issued on them nullities; the respondents, as the persons first making application \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n after the promulgation of the 1958 regulation, were held to be entitled to the leases. 116 U.S. App. D.C. 379, 324 F.2d 411 (1963). We granted certiorari, \n376 \nU.S. 961\n.\n\nWe conclude that the District Court correctly refused to issue a writ of mandamus, and accordingly reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. Since their promulgation, the Secretary has consistently construed both orders not to bar oil and gas leases; moreover, this interpretation has been made a repeated matter of public record. While the Griffin leases and others located in the Moose Range have been developed in reliance upon the Secretary's interpretation, respondents do not claim to have relied to their detriment upon a contrary construction. The Secretary's interpretation may not be the only one permitted by the language of the orders, but it is quite clearly a reasonable interpretation; courts must therefore respect it. McLaren v. Fleischer, \n256 \nU.S. 477, 481\n; Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., \n325 \nU.S. 410, 413\n-414.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 437, 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq. (1958 ed.), gave the Secretary of the Interior broad power to issue oil and gas leases on public lands not within any known geological structure of a producing oil and gas field. Although the Act directed that if a lease was issued on such a tract, it had to be issued to the first qualified applicant, it left the Secretary discretion to refuse to issue any lease at all on a given tract. United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, \n283 \nU.S. 414\n. The Act excluded from its application certain designated lands,\n3\n but did not exclude lands within wildlife refuge areas. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Kenai National Moose Range was created in 1941 by Executive Order No. 8979, 6 Fed. Reg. 6471, by which approximately two million acres of the public domain were set aside \"as a refuge and breeding ground for moose.\" The order provided that \"[n]one of the above-described lands excepting [a defined area] shall be subject to settlement, location, sale, or entry, or other disposition (except for fish trap sites) under any of the public-land laws applicable to Alaska . . . .\" On November 8, 1947, the Secretary promulgated the first general regulation dealing with the issuance of oil and gas leases within wildlife refuges. It provided simply that such leases had to be subjected to an approved unit plan and contain a provision prohibiting drilling or prospecting without the advance consent of the Secretary. 12 Fed. Reg. 7334.\n\nOn June 16, 1948, the Secretary issued Public Land Order No. 487, 13 Fed. Reg. 3462:\n\n\"[T]he public lands within the following-described areas in Alaska [including most of that portion of the Moose Range which had been excepted from Executive Order No. 8979] are hereby temporarily withdrawn from settlement, location, sale or entry, for classification and examination, and in aid of proposed legislation:\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"This order shall take precedence over, but shall not modify . . . the reservation for the Kenai National \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Moose Range made by Executive Order No. 8979 of December 16, 1941 . . . .\"\n\n\n Thus neither Executive Order No. 8979 nor Public Land Order No. 487 expressly withdrew the lands to which it applied from oil and gas leasing. In 1951, however, the Secretary set aside, for uses inconsistent with mineral leasing, minor portions of the lands covered by Public Land Order No. 487:\n\n\"[T]he following-described public lands in Alaska are hereby withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws, including the mining laws and the mineral-leasing laws . . . .\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n Had the Secretary thought that Public Land Order No. 487 had already withdrawn the lands covered by it from appropriation under the mineral-leasing laws, his reference to such laws in the 1951 orders would have been superfluous.\n\nBy an intra-agency memorandum dated August 31, 1953, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management advised the Regional Administrators of the Bureau and managers of the local land offices that \"a possible revision of policy and regulations\" on leasing in wildlife refuges was being studied, and directed them that \"[p]ending the completion of this study and the possible revision of existing regulations, you will suspend action on all pending oil and gas lease offers and applications for lands within such refuges.\" It is not disputed, and subsequent memoranda make clear, that the 1953 memorandum did not purport to prevent either the issuance of leases with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the approval of the national office or the continued filing of lease offers.\n5\n During late 1954 and early 1955, a number of individuals filed applications for oil and gas leases in the northern half of the Moose Range; among these applications were those of the Griffin lessees. Action on them was suspended in accordance with the 1953 directive, but none was rejected on the ground that the land in question was closed to leasing.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nOn September 9, 1955, the Secretary issued Public Land Order No. 1212, 20 Fed. Reg. 6795, revoking in its entirety Public Land Order No. 487. After granting certain preferences, it provided:\n\n \"6. Any of the lands described in paragraphs 4 (a), 4 (b) or 4 (d) of this order then remaining unappropriated, shall become subject to such application, petition, selection, or other form of appropriation by the public generally as may be authorized by the public-land laws, including the mineral-leasing laws . . . .\n\n\n \"7. Commencing at 10:00 a. m. on the 182nd day after the date of this order, any of the unsurveyed lands described in paragraph 4 (c) not settled upon by veterans or other persons entitled to credit \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n for service shall become subject to settlement and other forms of appropriation by the public generally, including leasing under the mineral-leasing laws . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Respondents make much of the italicized language, which does appear to be inconsistent with the Department's prior interpretation of Public Land Order No. 487 and its actual leasing practices. However, on October 14, 1955 - 35 days after it was promulgated but before it went into effect, and years before the respondents entered the picture - Public Land Order No. 1212 was amended to delete the references to the mineral-leasing laws. 20 Fed. Reg. 7904.\n\nOn December 8, 1955, the anticipated revision of the 1947 refuge-leasing regulation was promulgated. 20 Fed. Reg. 9009. It was more restrictive than the old regulation, and gave increased power to the Fish and Wildlife Service to approve or disapprove oil and gas development of refuges. It listed in an Appendix A a number of refuges (not including Kenai) in which, because of their importance to the preservation of rare species of plant and animal life, no leasing at all would be permitted. In Appendix B it listed certain areas (including a small part of the Moose Range not involved here) \"with respect to which the Fish and Wildlife Service reports that oil and gas development might seriously impair or destroy the usefulness of the lands for wildlife conservation purposes . . . .\" In such Appendix B areas, leasing was to be permitted only upon the approval by the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service of \"a complete and detailed operating program for the area.\" In all other wildlife areas the regulation provided that \"[o]il and gas leases may be issued\" provided they contain specified conditions requiring approval by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the type of prospecting to be conducted, and adoption by the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n lessee of a unit plan approved by the Service. Respondents argue that even if it be assumed that (as is clearly the case) the 1955 regulation treated the lands in controversy as open to leasing, the regulation is not probative of the availability of the lands for leasing prior to 1955, and is therefore no evidence that the Secretary viewed the lands as open to leasing at the time the Griffin applications were filed. We think, however, that if the Secretary had been of the opinion that he was changing the status of that part of the Moose Range not covered by Appendix B, rather than merely imposing additional restrictions on leasing therein, he would have done so in terms more express than those used in the 1955 regulation. He did not refer to the Range as a whole; the only reference by name was to those parts of the Range which were specified in order to except them from the general provision that \"[o]il and gas leases may be issued\" in wildlife refuges. Though this specification supports the inference that the regulation was drafted on the assumption that the remainder of the Range was open to leasing, such indirect implication - however clearly it confirms the preexisting availability of the Range - would have been a technique inappropriate for effecting a change of the Range's status. Moreover, the President's 1952 delegation to the Secretary of power to make or modify withdrawals had directed that \"[a]ll orders issued by the Secretary of the Interior under the authority of this order shall be designated as public land orders and shall be submitted . . . for filing and for publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER.\" Executive Order No. 10355, 17 Fed. Reg. 4831 (emphasis added). It may be that a document not labeled a public land order could in legal effect constitute an exercise of that power; however, if the Secretary had meant to exercise such power, it is likely that he would \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n have done so in the manner directed by the President's delegation.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWhen bills were introduced in Congress early in 1956 to restrict oil and gas leasing in wildlife refuges, the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the Subcommittee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held extensive hearings thereon. The bills as introduced only forbade the Secretary to \"dispose of\" lands in wildlife refuges, and the question arose during the hearings whether that language would apply to the issuance of oil and gas leases. A representative of the Department asserted, without contradiction, that the granting of an oil and gas lease was not a \"disposition\" and would not be affected by the language as proposed. Hearings before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on H. R. 5306, etc., 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 98. An amendment was accordingly proposed specifically restricting oil and gas leasing. Neither committee reported \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n favorably on the bills. However, the House Committee submitted a report stating that it had been decided to try, for an experimental period of time, an arrangement whereby each proposed alienation or relinquishment of any interest the Fish and Wildlife Service had in lands under its jurisdiction would be submitted to the Committee, which would within 60 days approve or disapprove the action contemplated. H. R. Rep. No. 1941, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 12-13. This resolution of the issue suggests that the Committee accepted the Department's view that the Secretary had pre-existing authority to grant oil and gas leases in the Moose Range, and was concerned only with the way in which he exercised his discretion.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries held public hearings on July 20 and 25, 1956, on a proposal from the Fish and Wildlife Service for the issuance of 30 oil and gas leases on 71,680 acres in the northern half of the Moose Range - located within the area encompassed by Executive Order No. 8979 - for which lease applications had been filed in 1954 by amicus curiae Richfield Oil Corporation and others. The proposal contemplated that the leases would be subject to the Swanson River Unit plan of operation, which had been approved by the Bureau of Land Management, the Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service, all branches of the Department of the Interior. At the hearing on the proposal a spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation urged that Executive Order No. 8979 precluded the issuance of the leases. Transcript of Hearing before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, July 20 and 25, 1956, Lease of Portions of Kenai National Moose Range, pp. 17, 19, 24-26. But see id., pp. 35-36; letter, July 24, 1956, Deputy Solicitor, Department of the Interior, to Hon. E. L. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Bartlett, Delegate to Congress from Alaska, following id., p. 30. On July 25, 1956, however, the Committee's Chairman advised the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service that the Committee unanimously had concluded that issuance of the leases would not be detrimental to the wildlife values of the Moose Range, and had concurred in the proposal to issue the leases.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nFollowing the Committee's approval the leases were issued, an exploratory well was drilled and oil was discovered in commercial quantities in July 1957. See Rep. Alaska Gov. 88 (1957); Rep. Secy. Int. 356 (1957); Rep. Secy. Int. 104, 199, 258, 356 (1958). The Swanson River leases soon became again a subject of congressional concern, when the Secretary of the Interior - realizing that although he had authority to issue leases on dry land, he lacked such authority with respect to lands beneath Alaskan inland navigable waters - asked Congress for authority to issue leases on Alaskan water bottoms, and to add to the leases already issued in Alaska and to applications pending there the water bottoms within their \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n boundaries.\n9\n The Senate Committee reported favorably on the proposed bill, saying:\n\n\"In Alaska, there is at the present time only one area which is now subject to the Mineral Leasing Act where oil and gas is known to exist in paying quantities, this being on the Kenai Peninsula as previously described. If prior to the effective date of this act, the producing structure on the Kenai is defined, then the holders of upland leases in such areas might be forced to compete for areas beneath adjacent lakes and streams. The committee felt that this result would work to the disadvantage of those lessees and developers who have gone ahead and developed this area . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 1720, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5.\n\n\n The bill was subsequently enacted into law. 72 Stat. 322 (1958), 48 U.S.C. 456 and 30 U.S.C. 251 (1958 ed.).\n\nMeanwhile, the controversy over the leasing policies to be followed in wildlife refuges was resolved by the adoption, on January 8, 1958, of another complete revision of the regulation. 23 Fed. Reg. 227, 43 CFR 192.9. The revision represented a near-total victory for the conservationists. It altogether prohibited oil and gas leasing, unless necessary to prevent draining, in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n wildlife refuges - with two exceptions: lands withdrawn for a dual purpose, and wildlife refuges located in Alaska. As to lands falling within these two excepted categories, the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service were to reach agreements specifying the lands which \"shall not be subject to oil and gas leasing\" and to decide on provisions to be required in leases issued on the remaining lands. The agreements were to become effective upon approval by the Secretary and publication in the Federal Register. The regulation further provided that \"[a]ll pending offers or applications heretofore filed for oil and gas leases covering game ranges, coordination lands, and Alaska wildlife areas, will continue to be suspended until the agreements referred to . . . shall have been completed,\" and that no new lease applications would \"be accepted for filing until the tenth day after the agreements . . . are noted on the land office records.\"\n\nPursuant to the regulation, there was published in the Federal Register on August 2, 1958, an order of the Secretary announcing the agreement reached with respect to the Moose Range. 23 Fed. Reg. 5883. The order decreed that certain lands within the Range (essentially the southern half) \"are hereby closed to oil and gas leasing because such activities would be incompatible with management thereof for wildlife purposes.\" It then provided:\n\n \"The balance of the lands within the Kenai National Moose Range are subject to the filing of oil and gas lease offers . . . . Offers to lease covering any of these lands which have been pending and upon which action was suspended in accordance with the regulation 43 CFR 192.9 (d) will now be acted upon and adjudicated in accordance with the regulations.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  . \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \". . . [L]ease offers for lands which have not been excluded from leasing will not be accepted for filing until the tenth day after the agreement and map are noted on the records of the land office . . . .\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\n The agreement was noted in the Anchorage land office on August 4, 1958, and 10 days later respondents filed their applications.\n\nSoon after the issuance of the regulation and the implementing order, the pending applications were acted upon; within the next two months, 294 leases covering 621,234 acres were issued in the area subject to Executive Order No. 8979, in response to applications (including those of the Griffin lessees) filed in 1954 and 1955. When these figures are added to those covering leases issued prior to 1958 (primarily those in the Swanson River area), it appears that in the area subject to Executive Order No. 8979, the Secretary issued a total of 331 leases covering 696,680 acres on applications filed during the period the Court of Appeals held that the area was closed to leasing. Thus, prior to the commencement of the instant suit, the Secretary had leased substantially the entire area \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n in controversy;\n11\n the Solicitor General further assures us that the lessees and their assignees had, in turn, expended tens of millions of dollars in the development of the leases.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWhen faced with a problem of statutory construction, this Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration. \"To sustain the Commission's application of this statutory term, we need not find that its construction is the only reasonable one, or even that it is the result we would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\" Unemployment Comm'n v. Aragon, \n329 \nU.S. 143, 153\n. See also, e. g., Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402\n; Universal Battery Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 580, 583\n. \"Particularly is this respect due when the administrative practice at stake `involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.'\" Power Reactor Co. v. Electricians, \n367 \nU.S. 396, 408\n. When the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is in issue, deference is even more clearly in order.\n\n\"Since this involves an interpretation of an administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt. . . . [T]he ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling weight unless \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., \n325 \nU.S. 410, 413\n-414.\n\n\n In the instant case, there is no statutory limitation involved. While Executive Order No. 8979 was issued by the President, he soon delegated to the Secretary full power to withdraw lands or to modify or revoke any existing withdrawals. See Executive Order No. 9146, 7 Fed. Reg. 3067; Executive Order No. 9337, 8 Fed. Reg. 5516; Executive Order No. 10355, 17 Fed. Reg. 4831. Public Land Order No. 487 was issued by the Secretary himself.\n\nMoreover, as the discussion in Section I of this opinion demonstrates, the Secretary has consistently construed Executive Order No. 8979 and Public Land Order No. 487 not to bar oil and gas leases.\n\n \"It may be argued that while these facts and rulings prove a usage they do not establish its validity. But government is a practical affair intended for practical men. Both officers, law-makers and citizens naturally adjust themselves to any long-continued action of the Executive Department - on the presumption that unauthorized acts would not have been allowed to be so often repeated as to crystallize into a regular practice. That presumption is not reasoning in a circle but the basis of a wise and quieting rule that in determining the meaning of a statute or the existence of a power, weight shall be given to the usage itself - even when the validity of the practice is the subject of investigation.\" United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 472\n-473.\n\n\n The Secretary's interpretation had, long prior to respondents' applications, been a matter of public record and discussion. The agreement worked out with the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries in 1956, and the approval of the Swanson River leases pursuant thereto, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n though probably constituting no \"legislative ratification\" in any formal sense,\n12\n serve to demonstrate the notoriety of the Secretary's construction, and thereby defeat any possible claim of detrimental reliance upon another interpretation. Finally, almost the entire area covered by the orders in issue has been developed, at very great expense, in reliance upon the Secretary's interpretation. In McLaren v. Fleischer, \n256 \nU.S. 477, 480\n-481, it was held:\n\n\"In the practical administration of the act the officers of the land department have adopted and given effect to the latter view. They adopted it before the present controversy arose or was thought of, and, except for a departure soon reconsidered and corrected, they have adhered to and followed it ever since. Many outstanding titles are based upon it and much can be said in support of it. If not the only reasonable construction of the act, it is at least an admissible one. It therefore comes within the rule that the practical construction given to an act of Congress, fairly susceptible of different constructions, by those charged with the duty of executing it is entitled to great respect and, if acted upon for a number of years, will not be disturbed except for cogent reasons.\"\n\n\n If, therefore, the Secretary's interpretation is not unreasonable, if the language of the orders bears his construction, we must reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nExecutive Order No. 8979, 6 Fed. Reg. 6471, provided:\n\n \"None of the above-described lands excepting [a described area] shall be subject to settlement, location, sale, or entry, or other disposition (except for fish trap sites) under any of the public-land laws applicable to Alaska, or to classification and lease under the provisions of the act of July 3, 1926, entitled `An Act to provide for the leasing of public lands in Alaska for fur farming, and for other purposes', 44 Stat. 821, U.S.C., title 48, secs. 360-361, or the act of March 4, 1927, entitled `An Act to provide for the protection, development, and utilization of the public lands in Alaska by establishing an adequate system for grazing livestock thereon', 44 Stat. 1452, U.S.C., title 48, secs. 471-471o . . . .\"\n\n\n\"Settlement,\" \"location,\" \"sale\" and \"entry\" are all terms contemplating transfer of title to the lands in question. It was therefore reasonable for the Secretary to construe \"or other disposition\" to encompass only dispositions which, like the four enumerated, convey or lead to the conveyance of the title of the United States - for example, \"grants\" and \"allotments.\" Cf. Opinion of the Solicitor, 48 I. D. 459 (1921).\n14\n An oil and gas lease does not vest title to the lands in the lessee. See Boesche v. Udall, \n373 \nU.S. 472, 477\n-478. Moreover, the term \"public-land laws\" is ordinarily used to refer to statutes governing the alienation of public land, and generally is distinguished from both \"mining laws,\" referring to statutes governing the mining of hard minerals on public lands, and \"mineral leasing laws,\" a term used to designate that group of statutes governing the leasing of public \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n lands for gas and oil. Compare Title 43 U.S.C., Public Lands, with Title 30 U.S.C., Mineral Lands and Mining.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n The reference in Executive Order No. 8979 to the 1926 and 1927 statutes also lends support to the Secretary's interpretation. For both statutes relate to leasing rather than alienation of title; it would be reasonable to infer from their specific addition that \"disposition\" was not intended to encompass leasing.\n16\n The Secretary also might reasonably have been influenced by a belief that in view of his overriding discretionary authority to refuse to issue an oil and gas lease on a given tract whenever he thought that granting a lease would undercut the purposes of the withdrawal, inclusion of such leases in the withdrawal order would have been unnecessary. Cf. Haley v. Seaton, 108 U.S. App. D.C. 257, 281 F.2d 620 (1960). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondents' reliance upon Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Barton, 60 App. D.C. 11, 46 F.2d 217 (1930), aff'd sub nom. United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, \n283 \nU.S. 414\n, is misplaced. Involved in Wilbur was the meaning of language contained in the Pickett Act, 36 Stat. 847 (1910), 43 U.S.C. 141 (1958 ed.).\n\n\"[T]he President may, at any time in his discretion, temporarily withdraw from settlement, location, sale, or entry any of the public lands of the United States including the District of Alaska . . . .\"\n\n\n It is true that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit squarely held this language to be sufficient to authorize withdrawals from oil and gas leasing. Moreover, this Court affirmed, albeit on an alternative theory: that the Mineral Leasing Act merely authorized and did not compel the issuance of prospecting permits. \n283 \nU.S., at 419\n. However, a word of history will place Wilbur in context and thereby demonstrate its irrelevance to the problem here. Prior to 1920, oil and gas rights in public lands were acquired in the same way as rights in other minerals - by a form of \"location.\" One staked out a location and prospected for oil or other minerals; upon making a discovery, he became entitled to a patent to the land as well as the minerals. In 1909, responding to rapid reserve depletion in certain areas, the Interior Department issued an order pursuant to Presidential authorization:\n\n \"In aid of proposed legislation affecting the use and disposition of the petroleum deposits on the public domain, all public lands in [a defined area of over 3 million acres in California and Wyoming] are hereby temporarily withdrawn from all forms of location, settlement, selection, filing, entry, or disposal under the mineral or nonmineral public land \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n laws. . . .\" U.S. Geological Survey, Bull. 623, H. R. Doc. No. 868, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 135 (1916); quoted, \n236 \nU.S., at 467\n.\n\n\n The power of the executive to make the withdrawal was upheld by this Court in 1915 in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459\n. In the meantime, however, Congress had, pursuant to the President's request, sought to remove all doubts about the legality of such orders by granting to him, in the Pickett Act, discretionary authority to withdraw public lands from \"settlement, location, sale, or entry.\"\n\nThe Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 changed the procedure for acquiring oil and gas rights in public lands: the Secretary was empowered to issue prospecting permits and required, in the event a discovery was made under the permit, to issue a lease which entitled the lessee to extract the mineral, but gave him no right in the land itself.\n17\n From 1920 on, therefore, the language of the Pickett Act no longer technically encompassed leasing. Nonetheless, it was clear that the Act had been specifically designed to legitimize orders like the 1909 withdrawal order. The Court of Appeals reasonably concluded in Wilbur that the fact that Congress had in 1920 changed the procedure - from \"location\" to \"leasing\" - for acquisition of oil and gas rights afforded no reason for concluding that they had thereby intended to cut back the power granted in 1910. 60 App. D.C., at 14-15, 46 F.2d, at 220-221. Thus neither that holding by the Court of Appeals nor this Court's affirmance in any way casts doubt upon the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation of the orders at bar, which were drafted long after the Mineral Leasing \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n Act had done away with location as a means of acquiring oil and gas rights.\n\nThe placement of the fish trap exception - \"(except for fish trap sites)\" - a phrase admittedly not relating to alienation of title to land, does tend to cut against the Secretary's interpretation of Executive Order No. 8979. However, it appears that the exception was designed to assure the Alaskans, whose livelihood is largely dependent on the salmon catch, that they could continue - despite the order - to use fish traps. Cf. Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, \n369 \nU.S. 60\n. Since it was a reassurance not technically necessary and therefore not functionally related to any part of the regulation, it is no surprise to find it carelessly placed. Compare Executive Order No. 8857, 6 Fed. Reg. 4287, establishing the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. We do not think the position of the fish trap exception is sufficient to justify a court's overturning the Secretary's construction as unreasonable.\n\nPublic Land Order No. 487 withdrew the lands it covered from \"settlement, location, sale or entry,\" but contained no reference to \"other disposition.\" Nor did it contain anything analogous to the fish trap exception. The reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation of Public Land Order No. 487 therefore follows a fortiori from the reasonableness of his construction of Executive Order No. 8979.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lease offers are processed in the order of filing and a lease on a given tract is issued as soon as an acceptable offer is reached. In the instant case, the Secretary's order of August 2, 1958, 23 Fed. Reg. 5883, directed that all lease offers filed within 10 days of August 14, 1958, would be treated as simultaneously filed, and that a public drawing would be held to determine the priorities among them. See 43 CFR 295.8 (1964). The drawing was held on September 4, 1959, and respondents prevailed. Thus their offers were processed before all other offers filed between August 14 and August 24, 1958; upon processing, however, it was discovered that the land was already covered by the leases issued to the Griffin lessees.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Public Land Order No. 487 encompassed the land for which respondent Coyle applied; the land for which the other nine respondents filed is covered by Executive Order No. 8979.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 1 of the Act excludes \"lands acquired under the Act known as the Appalachian Forest Act, approved March 1, 1911 (36 \n\n[380 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Stat. 961), and those in incorporated cities, towns, and villages and in national parks and monuments, those acquired under other Acts subsequent to February 25, 1920, and lands within the naval petroleum and oil-shale reserves, except as hereinafter provided . . .,\" 41 Stat. 437-438 (1920), as amended, 60 Stat. 950 (1946), 30 U.S.C. 181 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Public Land Order No. 751 of August 29, 1951, 16 Fed. Reg. 9044, which withdrew 160 acres for the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and 88.86 acres for townsite purposes, and Public Land Order No. 778 of December 29, 1951, 17 Fed. Reg. 159, which withdrew a number of tracts, aggregating 4,280 acres, for the use of the Army.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See memorandum, February 15, 1954, Director, Bureau of Land Management, to Assistant Secretary of the Interior; memorandum, August 12, 1955, Director, Bureau of Land Management, to Area Administrator, Area 4 (Alaska); 102 Cong. Rec. A6582.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, the Governor of Alaska stated: \"Residents of Alaska and major oil companies have continued to file lease applications and send exploratory parties into various parts of the Territory. The Kenai Moose Reserve on the Kenai Peninsula is covered with 325 lease applications awaiting decision of the Secretary of the Interior as to what stipulations for the protection of wildlife should be inserted in leases, if they are issued.\" Rep. Alaska Gov. 60-61 (1955); see also Rep. Secy. Int. 65 (1953).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] It appears that the Bureau regarded the amended regulations as automatically vacating the 1953 suspension order; however, upon the almost immediate introduction in Congress of bills further to restrict leasing in wildlife refuges, the field offices were directed once again to withhold final action on lease applications. See Richard K. Todd et al., 68 I. D. 291, 298 (1961). In further support of the claim that the 1955 regulation is worthless as an indication of the pre-existing status of the lands covered thereby, respondents urge that Appendix B listed \"wildlife refuges which were closed by the terms of the orders creating them.\" However, of the 176 refuges listed in Appendix B, respondents point to only one: the Salt Plains in Oklahoma. Moreover, only a small part of the Salt Plains (543 acres out of over 30,000) was specifically withdrawn from appropriation under the mining and mineral-leasing laws Public Land Order No. 144, 8 Fed. Reg. 9430. It is therefore doubtful that a simple listing in Appendix B of the \"Salt Plains,\" large parts of which were admittedly open to leasing prior to 1955, was intended to open the small area closed by Public Land Order No. 144.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Respondents seek to capitalize on the fact that although the Swanson River Unit was not located in any of the areas designated in Appendix B of the 1955 regulation, the applicants submitted, and obtained Service approval of, a detailed operating program for the unit. There are at least two possible explanations for the submission of the plan. First, the Fish and Wildlife Service could at any time designate areas not listed in Appendix B in which leasing \"might seriously impair or destroy\" conservation purposes and accordingly require advance approval of operating programs for them. Submission of a plan as to the Swanson River Unit might have been regarded as a means of insuring that the Service would not so designate the area. Second, the Secretary had directed his subordinates to withhold final action on lease applications pending a further revision of the regulations. The applicants may have submitted the plan in order to persuade the Department and the House Committee that the proposed leasing was consistent not only with existing regulations but also with any that were likely to be adopted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In the hearings before the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on the proposed bill, Mr. Gordon Goodwin, attorney for amicus curiae Richfield Oil Corporation, testified: \"Well, we have pending, and have had for 2 or 3 or more years, applications for leases in the Kenai moose range, and a few leases were issued in there, and that is where the discovery was made. But, shortly after that time, the Secretary suspended all leasing in the moose range . . . and he has never lifted it yet . . . . So we have not been able to do much business up there except to a very limited extent.\" Hearings before the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on H. R. 8054, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 77.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In announcing the order, the Secretary warned that there would be little land available to new applicants: \"Most of these lands are now covered by applications that will be adjudicated under the regulations of the Department.\" Department of the Interior Press Release, July 25, 1958. Respondents point to the fact that in a Press Release dated January 29, 1958, announcing the forthcoming (August) order, the Secretary had indicated that he was \"opening\" a part of the Moose Range to leasing. The choice of this term is wholly understandable in view of the facts that general instructions to local offices not to take final action on lease applications had been outstanding since 1953, and that the regulations of January 8, 1958, had provided that no new applications would be accepted for filing until a subsequent order was issued specifying the lands which would not be subject to leasing. Therefore, the order of August 2, 1958, did, in these two senses, \"open\" the Range to leasing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] In the area excepted from Executive Order No. 8979 but encompassed by Public Land Order No. 487, the total number of leases issued on applications filed before the revocation of the latter order was 74 covering 116,878 acres.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See Ex parte Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 303\n, n. 24; Boesche v. Udall, \n373 \nU.S. 472, 482\n-483; cf. Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 345\n; but cf. Brooks v. Dewar, \n313 \nU.S. 354, 360\n-361.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The failure of the court below to attach proper significance to the administrative practice seems to be attributable to the fact that it was misinformed concerning that practice. The respondents' brief in the Court of Appeals stated that \"[n]o leases issued for any lands within the Kenai Range between 1941 and 1958\" (p. 30), and that \"[t]he discovery as well as the increased activity were in areas of the Peninsula outside of the Kenai National Moose Range\" (p. 40).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] This view is taken in Hoffman, Oil and Gas Leasing on the Public Domain, p. 33 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Reference to the language of other withdrawal orders is not very fruitful. Amici curiae list 173 Executive and Public Land Orders issued between 1940 and 1952 which contained language expressly barring mineral leasing. Brief for Marathon Oil Co. and Union Oil Co. of California as amici curiae, pp. 6A-7A. However, respondents list 146 orders issued between 1936 and 1959 expressly permitting mineral leasing. Brief for Respondents, pp. 7a-10a.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Court of Appeals sought to explain the reference to the 1926 and 1927 Acts by construing the phrase \"any of the public-land laws applicable to Alaska\" to mean laws applicable both throughout the country and in Alaska, and opined that the 1926 and 1927 Acts were specifically added because they had application only in Alaska. However, the Secretary's interpretation of \"any of the public-land laws applicable to Alaska\" (as including, inter alia, laws relating to public lands located only in Alaska) is at least as natural as the Court of Appeals' interpretation (limiting the phrase to laws applicable throughout the country) and is beyond cavil a \"reasonable\" interpretation, which is the test the Court of Appeals should have been applying. Moreover, the Court of Appeals' conclusion that \"disposition\" was meant to include leasing renders the words \"or to classification and lease,\" initiating the reference to the Acts of 1926 and 1927, superfluous.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] In 1935, the prospecting permit procedure was eliminated and the present direct leasing procedure substituted.

Marr et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n Texas Eastern, which operates an interstate natural gas transmission system, agreed with certain producers to purchase for resale in interstate commerce their natural gas production in a substantially developed field with proven reserves. Before the Federal Power Commission (FPC) acted on the examiner's recommendation that certificates be granted, the \"Catco\" case (Public Serv. Comm'n of New York v. FPC, 257 F.2d 717, affirmed sub nom. Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York, \n360 \nU.S. 378\n) decided that the certificate applicants there involved had not satisfied their burden of justifying the natural gas sales price they proposed, which was lower than what Texas Eastern had agreed to pay. The parties here then framed a new plan in lieu of the previous conventional wellhead purchase arrangement but the economic effect of which was much the same. They agreed that Texas Eastern would purchase the producers' leasehold interests, covering only natural gas and condensate, in the lands where the gas was located. The FPC in proceedings reopened at Texas Eastern's request issued it a certificate to build connecting pipeline facilities, and, in connection with objections that the leases were not justified, noted that it had no authority to issue a certificate authorizing the leases. Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act makes the Act applicable \"to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale\" but not \"to the production or gathering of natural gas.\" On review of the FPC's action the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the certificate order and remanded the case on the ground that the FPC's opinion appeared to approve the pricing aspects of the gas lease acquisitions without evidentiary support. That the gas would be acquired by lease transactions not subject to FPC regulation was unimportant, the court thought, since FPC could regulate the purchaser through its certification authority over the connecting facilities. The FPC thereafter \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n reopened the proceedings and, concluding that it was not foreclosed by either its previous rulings or the Court of Appeals' mandate, decided that it had jurisdiction over the lease-sales. The FPC held that it would not be in the public interest to certificate the transaction since it was not satisfied that the unit cost of the gas was reasonable or could be accurately determined. The parties were given a period to reframe the transaction. Under the alternative appeal route provided by 19 (b) of the Act, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which reversed on the ground that the FPC had no jurisdiction over leases since they relate to the production and gathering of natural gas. Held:\n\n 1. Sales of the leasehold interests in a proven and substantially developed natural gas field are \"sales\" of natural gas within the meaning of 1 (b) of the Act. Pp. 399-401.\n\n\n (a) The purposes of the Act would be frustrated if regulation thereunder were made to depend upon technical title concepts of local law. P. 400.\n\n\n (b) The determinative economic fact is that the sale of the leases in a field where the supply was proven and the facilities were well developed accomplished the transfer of large amounts of natural gas to an interstate pipeline for resale in other States. P. 401.\n\n\n 2. A sale of leasehold interests in proven reserves for transmission and resale in interstate commerce is not within the \"production or gathering\" exemption of the Act; the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., \n337 \nU.S. 498\n, where the leases were undeveloped and the sale of the natural gas was in intrastate commerce. Pp. 402-404.\n\n\n 3. Neither the mandate of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit nor the original FPC order established as the \"law of the case\" that the FPC lacked jurisdiction over the leasehold transfers. Pp. 404-406.\n\n\n (a) The issue of the FPC's jurisdiction over such transfers was not before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had held that the FPC could regulate the purchaser, regardless of the status of the seller. Pp. 404-405.\n\n\n (b) Any doubts about construction of the mandate of the initial reviewing court should be resolved in the FPC's favor since routing of the appeal to a different court precludes clarification of the mandate by the court which issued it. P. 405. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) The FPC was free in considering the question of production costs on remand to reconsider its initial erroneous position on the jurisdictional question.

Holtzinger, Jr., for Southern California Gas Co. et al. in both cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, \n347 \nU.S. 672\n, the Court held that Federal Power Commission jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act, as amended, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq. (1964 ed.), extended to what are described colloquially and perhaps somewhat loosely as \"wellhead\" sales of natural gas by producers to interstate pipeline companies for resale in interstate commerce. The issue in the present cases is whether sales to an interstate \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n pipeline company of leases covering proven and substantially developed reserves of gas to be sold in interstate commerce are also subject to Commission jurisdiction. We hold that they are.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn 1957, Texas Eastern, a natural gas company which owns and operates an interstate transmission system extending from Texas to the Philadelphia-Newark area, executed gas purchase contracts with Continental Oil Company, M. H. Marr, Sun Oil Company, and General Crude Oil Company, to purchase their natural gas production in Rayne Field, Louisiana, at an initial price of 23.9 per Mcf.\n1\n The producers applied to the Commission for certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing them to sell their gas to Texas Eastern. Texas Eastern applied for a certificate permitting it to build new pipeline facilities to connect its system to Rayne Field. After a hearing, and in spite of objections by several intervenors to the 23.9 price, the examiner issued a decision recommending a grant of the requested certificates. However, before the Commission acted on the examiner's decision, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit handed down its decision in Public Serv. Comm'n of New York v. FPC, 257 F.2d 717\n2\n (the \"Catco\" case), reversing an order of the Commission granting unconditional certificates for sales of natural gas on the ground that the certificate applicants had the burden of showing that the proposed sale price of 22.4 was justified by public convenience and necessity, and that the burden had not been sustained. Thereafter the producers in the present case requested the Commission to permit withdrawal of their applications for sales to Texas Eastern at \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n 23.9 (1.5 higher than the Catco price) and canceled the sales contracts. The parties then agreed on a different method for achieving their objectives.\n\nUnder the new plan formulated by the parties, Texas Eastern, instead of making conventional wellhead purchases of natural gas, proposed to buy the producers' leasehold interests in the Rayne Field lands in which the natural gas was located. The provisions of the lease-sale agreements were such that they were very close in economic effect to conventional sales of natural gas. The gas reserves in Rayne Field were proven, and the field substantially developed.\n3\n Texas Eastern was still to build the connecting facilities to the field which had been called for under the original plan, and the same volumes of gas were to flow into its system. The lease-sales were to cover no minerals except natural gas and condensate, all other mineral rights being reserved to the lease-sellers, and by a management agreement Continental Oil, one of the sellers, was to continue to do the bulk of production work.\n4\n Payments on the purchase price could be accelerated if gas production exceeded a specified amount, and the leases were purchased through an intermediate corporation so that Texas Eastern's liability would be substantially limited if production from the field fell below expectations.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n Completion of the transfers was conditioned upon issuance of the necessary certificates by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission granted Texas Eastern's request to reopen the proceedings in order to consider the lease-sale plan, and issued an unconditional certificate to Texas Eastern permitting it to build the pipeline facilities necessary to connect with Rayne Field. In issuing the certificate the Commission overruled objections made by the New York Public Service Commission that the prices paid for the leases were not justified, and noted that \"Texas Eastern has not filed an application for a certificate authorizing the acquisition of the Rayne Field leases and we have no authority to issue such a certificate.\" 21 F. P. C. 860, 864.\n\nSoon thereafter the lease-sale transactions were completed and Texas Eastern began to receive gas from Rayne Field for interstate distribution. However, on review of the Commission's action the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the certificate order because the language and tenor of the Commission's opinion appeared to approve the prices paid for the leases under the acquisition agreement. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York v. FPC, 109 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 287 F.2d 143. The court thought it of \"no importance here that the transactions by which Texas Eastern proposes to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 398]\n\u00a0\n acquire the gas will themselves be, by virtue of a change in form, beyond the regulatory control of the Commission,\" id., at 292, 287 F.2d, at 146, since the Commission could regulate Texas Eastern through its certification authority over the connecting facilities regardless of its jurisdiction over the lease-sale transactions themselves. The Court therefore remanded, stating that:\n\n \"Two courses are open to the Commission. It may, by clarification of the order presently under review, expressly disclaim any approval of the price to be paid for natural gas by the applicant. . . . Or it may reopen the record in the certificate proceeding to permit Texas Eastern to establish by adequate evidence that the acquisition costs which it proposes to incur will be consistent with the public convenience and necessity.\" Ibid.\n\n\n The Commission chose to reopen the proceedings. After hearings before an examiner, it decided that the question of its jurisdiction over the lease-sales themselves, as opposed to authority over Texas Eastern's connecting facilities, was not foreclosed either by previous Commission rulings or the mandate of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On the merits, it decided that a holding that it had no jurisdiction to inquire into production costs because the transaction was cast as a sale of leases instead of a sale of natural gas \"would exalt form over substance, would give greater weight to the technicalities of contract draftsmanship than to the achievement of the purposes of the Natural Gas Act, and would impair our ability to control the price received for gas sold to the pipelines in interstate commerce to the detriment of the ultimate consumer.\" 29 F. P. C. 249, 256.\n\nAfter asserting jurisdiction over the lease-sales, the Commission concluded that it would not be in the public interest to certificate them. Reasoning that the transaction \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 399]\n\u00a0\n was not subject to effective regulation because of the difficulty of estimating the unit price paid for the gas and the impossibility of providing continuing price regulation because of the one-shot nature of the sale, it ordered that the parties be given a six-month period in which to reframe the transaction so as to rectify these alleged infirmities.\n\nAppeal was taken, not to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but to the Fifth Circuit pursuant to the alternative routes of appeal provided by 19 (b) of the Act.\n6\n That court reversed. It interpreted this Court's decision in FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., \n337 \nU.S. 498\n, as holding that leases such as those here involved \"relate to the production or gathering of natural gas and are thus outside Commission jurisdiction . . . .\" 336 F.2d 320, 325. Under this view, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether the earlier decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had established \"the law of the case\" on the jurisdictional question. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 958\n, because of the importance of the issue to the proper administration of the Natural Gas Act. It should be noted that no questions are before us relating to the propriety of the Commission's disposition of the case following its assertion of jurisdiction. It is only the jurisdictional question which we must answer. We reverse.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSection 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act provides that \"[t]he provisions of this Act shall apply . . . to the sale \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 400]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale . . . but shall not apply . . . to the production or gathering of natural gas.\" 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C. 717 (b) (1964 ed.).\n\nWithout impugning in any way the good faith and genuineness of the transactions, we think it clear that the lease-sales here in question can nonetheless be considered \"sales\" of natural gas in interstate commerce for purposes of the Act. A regulatory statute such as the Natural Gas Act would be hamstrung if it were tied down to technical concepts of local law.\n7\n The Court recognized as much in Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 111\n, when it held that \"employee\" as used in the National Labor Relations Act was to be defined by reference \"to the purpose of the Act and the facts involved in the economic relationship\" (id., at 129) rather than exclusively by reference to common law standards or local law. Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402\n, decided under the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, is also closely analogous to this phase of the cases at bar. The Act provided for establishment of minimum and maximum prices for soft coal, and specified that \"the sale or delivery or offer for sale of coal at a price below such minimum or above such maximum shall constitute a violation of the code . . . .\" 50 Stat. 80. A large coal consumer leased coal lands on which established mine facilities were located, and entered into management agreements with a contractor to whom the landowners had leased the mine facilities. It then claimed that the coal it had thus obtained was not subject to the Act because there had been no \"sale or delivery or offer for sale\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 401]\n\u00a0\n by the producers, but only the sale of leases in the coal lands. The Court rejected this claim, stating that \"the purpose of Congress, which was to stabilize the industry through price regulation, would be hampered by an interpretation that required a transfer of title, in the technical sense, to bring a producer's coal, consumed by another party within the ambit of the coal code.\" \n314 \nU.S., at 416\n.\n\nThe implications of the Hearst and Gray v. Powell approaches for the cases at hand are manifest. The sales of leases here involved were, in most respects, equivalent to conventional sales of natural gas which unquestionably would be subject to Commission jurisdiction under Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, \n347 \nU.S. 672\n. Indeed, the context of this case shows that when the first plan was aborted by the Catco case, the parties did not alter their objectives, but merely the method of attaining them. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit described the lease-sale plan as a \"change in form.\" There are differences, to be sure, between the original sale agreements and the lease-sale plan. For example, Texas Eastern has the power to make the major decisions controlling further development of the field, and we are told that the lease-sales will not trigger \"favored nation\" clauses in other gas contracts. But it is perfectly clear that the sales of these leases in Rayne Field, a proven and substantially developed field, accomplished the transfer of large amounts of natural gas to an interstate pipeline company for resale in other States. That is the significant and determinative economic fact. To ignore it would substantially undercut Phillips, and because of it the Commission (unless foreclosed, infra, pp. 404-406) acted properly in treating these sales of leasehold interests as sales of natural gas within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe turn then to the question whether these lease-sales, even though sales of natural gas within the meaning of the Act, are nonetheless outside Commission jurisdiction because of the exemption for \"production or gathering.\"\n\nThe statement in Phillips that \"production and gathering, in the sense that those terms are used in 1 (b), end[ed] before the sales by Phillips occur[red]\" (\n347 \nU.S., at 678\n), could be read to turn the \"production or gathering\" exemption purely on a matter of the timing of the title transfer. That would mean, of course, that the lease-sales here involved were within the production or gathering exemption, for at the time of the transfer the gas was still in the ground. The same would be true for any sale of gas in place. Acceptance of any such narrow interpretation would make Phillips a shadow. Its substance lies, instead, in the judgment that \"[p]rotection of consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural-gas companies was the primary aim of the Natural Gas Act,\" id., at 685, and \"congressional intent [was] to give the Commission jurisdiction over the rates of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce.\" Id., at 682. We have not limited Phillips to a matter of the timing of the transaction, see Cities Service Gas Co. v. State Corp. Comm'n of Kansas, \n355 \nU.S. 391\n, reversing, per curiam, 180 Kan. 454, 304 P.2d 528, and consider that it would be a mistake to do so.\n\nWe conclude that even though a sale of natural gas in interstate commerce occurs before production or gathering is ended, it is nonetheless subject to regulation. In the context of such a sale, as distinguished from the situation in FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., \n337 \nU.S. 498\n, to be discussed hereafter, the \"production or gathering\" exemption relates to the physical activities, processes and facilities of production or gathering, but not to sales of the kind affirmatively subjected to Commission jurisdiction. This accommodation of the two relevant \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 403]\n\u00a0\n clauses of 1 (b) gives content to the national objectives of the Natural Gas Act as expounded in Phillips, and to the Commission's jurisdiction to accomplish them, while in no way interfering with state regulatory power over the physical processes of production or gathering in furtherance of conservation or other legitimate state concerns.\n\nRespondents argue that the Court's decision in FPC v. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., supra, precludes this result. In Panhandle an interstate pipeline company transferred undeveloped leases to a production company. The Government asserted that Commission jurisdiction should attach because the gas reserves covered by the leases had been included in the interstate company's rate base computation and because the lessening of its natural gas reserves might affect the pipeline company's ability to perform adequately the obligations for which it had been certificated. This Court disagreed, holding that the disposition of undeveloped leases was encompassed by the production or gathering exemption.\n\nTwo distinctions between Panhandle and the present case are apparent. First, the Panhandle leases were undeveloped. The Rayne Field leaseholds were substantially developed.\n8\n Natural gas would and did begin to flow into the Texas Eastern system immediately upon completion of its connection with the field. The substantiality of development is a relevant consideration, for the more that must be done before the gas begins its interstate journey, the less the transaction resembles the conventional wellhead sale of natural gas in interstate commerce which, as Phillips held, the Act has affirmatively placed within Commission jurisdiction. Second, Panhandle did not involve a sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, but a transfer by an interstate transmission company to a production company for sale of the gas in \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 404]\n\u00a0\n intrastate commerce. Hence, the Panhandle court did not have before it the present problem - whether the transfer to an interstate pipeline company for transmission and resale in interstate commerce of proven and substantially developed gas reserves is subject to Commission jurisdiction. This was largely the problem which the Court later faced in Phillips and resolved in favor of jurisdiction.\n\nThe language of Panhandle is unquestionably broad. But flat statements such as \"[o]f course leases are an essential part of production.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 505\n, should not be taken to cover more than the particular kind of leases that were before the Court; it should not be considered as embracing each and every transfer that can be put in lease form. Concepts of stare decisis in statutory interpretation apply to the holdings with which the case-by-case method of decision surrounds a statute. To recognize no differences between the Panhandle transfers and those in issue here, and in the name of stare decisis to hold that Commission jurisdiction depends on the form rather than the substance of the transaction, would turn the case-by-case process against itself.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nBecause we differ with the court below on the jurisdictional issue, it is necessary for us to reach the question which the Fifth Circuit did not decide - whether the mandate of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the prior ruling of the Commission established the law of the case.\n\nThe original Commission order granting Texas Eastern a certificate to construct its connecting facilities proceeded on the basis that the Commission lacked authority to certificate the leasehold transfers. That question was not put in issue before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The opinion assumed its correctness \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 405]\n\u00a0\n with the single statement, citing Panhandle, that \"the Commission has been held to lack jurisdiction over gas leases,\" 109 U.S. App. D.C., at 291, 287 F.2d, at 145, and concluded that \"[t]he relevance of Texas Eastern's acquisition costs to these matters is unaffected by the form of the transaction; the Commission's warrant to inquire arises by virtue of its responsibility to regulate the purchaser, regardless of the status of the seller.\" Id., at 292, 287 F.2d, at 146. On remand, the Commission stated that in its previous decision it had \"merely noted without discussion that we had no authority to issue a certificate for the acquisition of the leases . . . . It is apparent the issue was hardly considered in the earlier phase of this proceeding.\" 29 F. P. C. 249, 253. In exercising the warrant to inquire, the Commission became aware of the difficulties of inquiring into the reasonableness of the acquisition prices without having jurisdiction over the transfers, and as a result, reconsidered the jurisdictional question.\n\nWe do not think that either the prior Commission decision or the initial opinion on review foreclosed that possibility. It is extremely doubtful that certiorari would have been appropriate from the decision which the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit allegedly made on the jurisdictional question, with the result that review by this Court would be precluded on this basic question of Commission jurisdiction. Furthermore, in light of the fact that this case followed two different routes of appeal.\n9\n thus eliminating the possibility that the initial reviewing court would clarify the extent of its mandate, compare Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. FTC, 326 F.2d 517, it is appropriate to resolve doubts about the construction of the initial mandate in the Commission's favor. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that the Commission's decision to reconsider the jurisdictional issue was consistent with a decision to inquire into the acquisition costs. \"On review the court may thus correct errors of law and on remand the Commission is bound to act upon the correction. . . . But an administrative determination in which is imbedded a legal question open to judicial review does not impliedly foreclose the administrative agency, after its error has been corrected, from enforcing the legislative policy committed to its charge.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v.

But since we deal with the vagaries of a statute with no constitutional overtones, I think the matter should be left where Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line left it, saving for the Congress, of course, the power to expand the regime of the federal bureaucracy if it desires. It is sometimes customary for a court to distinguish precedents to the vanishing point, creating an illusion of certainty in the law while leaving only a shadow of an ancient landmark. That is within the judicial competence and has been done before. But where the issue has been so hotly contested as it was in Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line and when the Court has been so explicit in bringing traffic in gas leases under the \"production or gathering of natural gas\" which Congress left to the States, I would adhere to that result until Congress changes it. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 392, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED GAS IMP CO. v.

Callery Properties, Inc., et al., No. 26, Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. v. Federal Power Commission et al., and No. 32, Federal Power Commission v. Callery Properties, Inc., et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n Following this Court's decision in the CATCO case, \n360 \nU.S. 378\n, and its vacation of a judgment upholding initial natural gas prices of 21.4 to 23.8 per Mcf. for numerous gas producers in southern Louisiana, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) instituted an area rate proceeding, from which the present applications were severed for a separate hearing. The producers were advised that they would have to refund amounts ultimately found inconsistent with the public interest and necessity requirements of 7 of the Natural Gas Act. Following the hearing the FPC imposed conditions on the certificates granted, viz., that (1) the producers start service at 18.5 per Mcf., plus 1.5 tax reimbursement where applicable - the \"in-line\" price for FPC-certificated gas sales for the contracts here involved, and (2) the producers should not, before establishment of just and reasonable area rates or July 1, 1967, whichever should be earlier, file rates above 23.55, the level at which the FPC found filings might trigger other producers' increased rates under contract escalation clauses with the pipelines here involved. The FPC also ordered refunded the excess of charges under the original certificate, over the proper initial prices. The Court of Appeals held on review that (1) the producers should not have been limited to an initial \"in-line\" gas price without the FPC's considering evidence of what would be a just and reasonable price; (2) the FPC lacked power to fix a producer's maximum future rates; and (3) the measure of the refunds should have been the difference between the original contract price and the ultimate just and reasonable price. Held:\n\n 1. The FPC had ample power under 7 of the Natural Gas Act to protect the public interest by requiring as an interim \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 224]\n\u00a0\n measure that interstate gas prices be no higher than existing levels under other contemporaneous certificates, i. e., the \"in-line\" prices, without considering the extensive evidence under which just and reasonable rates are fixed under 5. Pp. 227-228.\n\n\n 2. It was a proper exercise of its administrative expertise for the FPC to fix the 23.55 rate limit, beyond which it found that a general price rise might be triggered by escalation during the interim period. Pp. 228-229.\n\n\n 3. In the exercise of its authorized power to order that refunds be paid as promptly as possible, the FPC could properly measure the refunds due by the difference between the original contract rates which it had erroneously sanctioned and the \"in-line\" rates; and the FPC was justified in imposing interest to prevent unjust enrichment.

R. Frankel et al., respondents in Nos. 21, 22 and 32.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Federal Power Commission in 1958-1959 granted unconditional certificates of public convenience and necessity to numerous producers of gas in south Louisiana, the sales contracts of the producers calling for initial prices ranging from 21.4 cents to 23.8 cents per Mcf. After deliveries commenced under those contracts, consumer interests challenged the orders in various courts of appeals. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sustained the Commission's action (United Gas Improvement Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 269 F.2d 865) but we vacated the judgment (Public Service Comm'n v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n361 \nU.S. 195\n) for reconsideration in light of Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Comm'n (CATCO), \n360 \nU.S. 378\n; and the other courts of appeals did likewise.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe Commission thereupon instituted an area rate proceeding for south Louisiana and consolidated the remanded \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 226]\n\u00a0\n cases with that proceeding. 25 F. P. C. 942. It advised the producers of their potential obligation to refund any amounts eventually found to be inconsistent \"with the requirements of the public interest and necessity\" under 7 of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 824, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 717f. 27 F. P. C. 15. Later the Commission in the interest of expedition severed the present group of applications and set them for a hearing in a consolidated proceeding under 7. 27 F. P. C. 482. At the end, the Commission imposed two conditions on the certificates granted in these cases. First, it provided that the producers commence service at 18.5 cents per Mcf., plus 1.5 cents tax reimbursement where applicable, a price that it found to be \"in line\" with prices for Commission-certificated sales of gas from the southern Louisiana production area under generally contemporaneous contracts, 30 F. P. C. 283, 288-289. Second, it provided that until just and reasonable area rates are determined for south Louisiana, or until July 1, 1967, whichever is earlier, the producers shall not file any increased rates above 23.55 cents, the level at which rate filings might trigger increased rates by other producers under the escalation provisions of their contracts with the pipeline companies here involved. 30 F. P. C. 283, 298.\n\nIn addition, the Commission ordered the producers to refund to their customers the amounts in excess of the proper initial price which they had already collected under the original certificate. 30 F. P. C. 283, 290.\n\nOn review the Court of Appeals held that the Commission erred in limiting producers to an initial \"in-line\" price without first canvassing evidence bearing on the question of what would be a just and reasonable price for the gas. It further held that the Commission had no power to place an upper limit on future rates that a producer might file. Finally, the Court of Appeals, while \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 227]\n\u00a0\n upholding the power of the Commission to order refunds, held that the measure of such refunds was not to be the difference between the \"in-line\" price and the original contract price, but between the latter and the just and reasonable price subsequently to be fixed. 335 F.2d 1004. We granted certiorari, \n380 \nU.S. 931\n. We reverse the Court of Appeals.\n\nWe think the Commission acted lawfully and responsibly in line with our decision in the CATCO case where we held that it need not permit gas to be sold in the interstate market at the producer's contract price, pending determination of just and reasonable rates under 5, 52 Stat. 823, 15 U.S.C. 717d. \n360 \nU.S. 378, 388\n-391. Rather, we held that there is ample power under 7 (e),\n2\n to attach appropriate protective conditions. And see Federal Power Comm'n v. Hunt, \n376 \nU.S. 515, 524\n-527. The fixing of an initial \"in-line\" price establishes a firm price at which a producer may operate, pending determination of a just and reasonable rate, without any contingent obligation to make refunds should a just and reasonable rate turn out to be lower than the \"in-line\" price. Consumer protection is afforded by keeping the \"in-line\" price at the level where substantial amounts of gas have been certificated to enter the market under other contemporaneous certificates, no longer subject to judicial review or in any way \"suspect.\" We believe the Commission can properly conclude under 7 that adequate protection to the public interest requires as an interim measure that gas not enter the interstate market at prices higher than existing levels. To consider in this 7 proceeding the mass of evidence relevant to the fixing of just and reasonable \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 228]\n\u00a0\n rates under 5 might in practical effect render nugatory any effort to fix initial prices.\n3\n We said in CATCO that 7 procedures are designed \"to hold the line awaiting adjudication of a just and reasonable rate\" (\n360 \nU.S., at 392\n), and that \"the inordinate delay\" in 5 proceedings (\n360 \nU.S., at 391\n) should not cripple them.\n\nThe second condition, which temporarily bars rate increases beyond 23.55 cents per Mcf., was likewise aimed at keeping the general price level relatively constant pending determination of the just and reasonable rate. We noted in Federal Power Comm'n v. Hunt, supra, at 524, that \"a triggering of price rises often results from the out-of-line initial pricing of certificated gas\" and that the possibility of refund does not afford sufficient protection. And see Federal Power Comm'n v. Texaco Inc., \n377 \nU.S. 33, 42\n-43. We think, contrary to the Court of Appeals, that there was ample power under 7 (e) for the Commission to attach these conditions for consumer protection during this interim period though the certificate was not a temporary one, as in Hunt, but a permanent one, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 229]\n\u00a0\n as in CATCO and Federal Power Comm'n v. Texaco Inc., supra.\n\nThe \"in-line\" price of 18.5 cents is supported by the contract prices in the south Louisiana area that were not \"suspect,\" and the selection of 23.55 cents beyond which a price increase might trigger escalation reflects the Commission's expertise.\n\nWe also conclude that the Commission's refund order was allowable. We reject, as did the Court of Appeals below, the suggestion that the Commission lacked authority to order any refund. While the Commission \"has no power to make reparation orders,\" Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n320 \nU.S. 591, 618\n, its power to fix rates under 5 being prospective only, Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, supra, at 389, it is not so restricted where its order, which never became final, has been overturned by a reviewing court. Here the original certificate orders were subject to judicial review; and judicial review at times results in the return of benefits received under the upset administrative order. See Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 200\n-201. An agency, like a court, can undo what is wrongfully done by virtue of its order. Under these circumstances, the Commission could properly conclude that the public interest required the producers to make refunds\n4\n for the period in which \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 230]\n\u00a0\n they sold their gas at prices exceeding those properly determined to be in the public interest.\n\nWe think that the Commission could properly measure the refund by the difference between the rates charged and the \"in-line\" rates to which the original certificates should have been conditioned. The Court of Appeals would delay the payment of the refund until the \"just and reasonable\" rate could be determined. We have said elsewhere that it is the duty of the Commission, \"where refunds are found due, to direct their payment at the earliest possible moment consistent with due process.\" Federal Power Comm'n v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., \n371 \nU.S. 145, 155\n. These excessive rates have been collected since 1958; under the circumstances, the Commission was not required to delay this refund further. And the imposition of interest on refunds is not an inappropriate means of preventing unjust enrichment. See Texaco, Inc. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 290 F.2d 149, 157; Philip Carey Mfg. Co. v. Labor Board, 331 F.2d 720, 729-731.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See United Gas Improvement Co. v.

See, e. g., Continental Oil Co., 27 F. P. C. 96, 102-108. Experience convinced it that the minimal utility derived from cost and economic trend evidence was out-weighed by the administrative burdens and delays its consideration inevitably produced. See Skelly Oil Co., 28 F. P. C. 401, 410-412. The Commission properly and constructively exercised its discretion in declining to consider this large quantity of evidence. To have done so would have required a considerable expenditure of manpower, cf. Wisconsin v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n373 \nU.S. 294, 313\n. We have previously encouraged the Commission to devise reasonable means of streamlining its procedures, see Federal Power Comm'n v. Hunt, supra, at 527, and we regard the Commission's decision here as an appropriate step in that direction. Cf. Federal Power Comm'n v. Texaco Inc., \n377 \nU.S. 33, 44\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The problem of refunds for amounts collected above the \"in-line\" price is not affected here by any filing under 4 for increases within the limits of the triggering moratorium. 52 Stat. 822, 15 U.S.C. 717c. Under 4 (d), a 30-day notice to the Commission and to the public is required for all rate increases, the Commission having authority under 4 (e) to suspend the new rate for five months and thereafter to act only \"after full hearings.\" If the Commission has not acted at the expiration of the period of suspension, the new rates become effective. The Commission may require the producer to furnish a bond, and thereafter may compel refund of \"the portion of such increased rates or charges by its decision found not justified.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nWhile the Commission's expansive view of its powers seems to me largely defensible in the abstract, I believe its actual decision reveals error and unfairness in important respects.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe price condition, alone of the three key prongs of the Commission's order, can in my view be wholly sustained. The chief challenge to it stems from the exclusion \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 231]\n\u00a0\n in the 7 hearing of a mass of cost and supply-demand evidence tendered by producers.\n1\n Although the encompassing 7 standard of public convenience and necessity encourages a broad inquiry, the Commission has given valid reasons for limiting itself to the in-line price for the time being. Area pricing ultimately aims to simplify proceedings under the statute, but the transition to it is said to strain the Commission's present resources for investigation. See Wisconsin v. FPC, \n373 \nU.S. 294, 298\n-300, 313-314. The in-line price, comparatively easy to fix, provides a firm basis for producers, helps avoid unrefundable initial overcharges, and exerts a downward pressure on price; at the same time, producers can file increases under 4 with a six-month delay at most. The Commission has given a fair trial to cost evidence,\n2\n and nothing in the offer of proof suggests a supply-demand crisis warranting court intervention with this administrative approach.\n\nIn locating the in-line price, the Commission has ignored a number of contemporaneous high-price contracts labeled \"suspect\" because then under review, disapproved, or deemed influenced by those under review or disapproved. Although the danger of using a crooked measuring rod demands some precaution, this blanket exclusion also chances some distortion in favor of an unduly low in-line price. In the main the producers have chosen not to brief this question, apparently under the misapprehension that the Government has not here sought to sustain the exclusion of these contracts or that the lower court's failure to reach the question precluded this Court from doing so.\n3\n But while the suspect order rule may by default be abided in this instance, I would \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 232]\n\u00a0\n not close the door to future arguments for a different solution of the dilemma.\n\nA last troubling aspect of the in-line price derives from a critical and unusual circumstance: it, like the other conditions in this case, was imposed for the first time on remand, several years after an unconditioned permanent certificate had issued. Presumably for six months hence, producers will be compelled to sell at a price they might not have accepted when free to refuse; for all that appears, the price may even be below cost, let alone a fair profit. However, in general the producers apparently did not seek an option to cancel future sales if dissatisfied by the newly conditioned certificates, the six-month delay is both brief and familiar, and I cannot say the Commission did not have a legitimate interest in imposing the in-line price at the time it did.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe price-increase moratorium also seems to me a measure not generally beyond the Commission's grasp, but it should not be sustained on the record before us. Recognizing force in the contrary view of the Court of Appeals, I do not believe that 4 must be read to bestow on producers an invincible right to raise prices subject only to a six-month delay and refund liability. Cf. FPC v. Texaco Inc., \n377 \nU.S. 33\n; FPC v. Hunt, \n376 \nU.S. 515\n. A freeze until 1967 is not permanent price-fixing, and in this interregnum between individual and area pricing, the hazard of irreversible price increases warrants imposing some brake. A lengthy moratorium - coupled with a refusal to consider cost or supply-demand figures in setting prices for the duration - might present a real risk of choking off supply, but such a case is not before us.\n\nNevertheless, a moratorium instituted on remand is a hazardous device at best, and the present one is simply not supported by evidence. Because the producers have \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 233]\n\u00a0\n no chance to refuse the certificates after commencing delivery, the ceiling may coerce sales at unfairly low prices. Yet while the present moratorium must be endured longer than the in-line price, at least it permits the producers to charge a markedly higher amount; and as the safety valve for a price explosion, the moratorium could be upheld. At this point, however, the Government's argument fails for lack of proof that a price explosion is likely if increases rise above the moratorium figure. The Commission's figure was not considered by its hearing examiner, who made no recommendation for a moratorium. The Commission report itself devotes no more than one conclusory sentence, qualified by a footnote, to the question of what specific price rise will trigger increases at large, 30 F. P. C., at 298; rather than amplifying, the Government brief merely contends that the point has not been adequately preserved under 19 - a contention I do not accept.\n4\n Several producers state that the Commission's fear of triggering has not been realized although sales are currently being made by them at levels above the intended moratorium price.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWhile agreeing that the Commission has power to order refunds in the case before us, I believe the measure of repayment it selected is illogical and harsh. On the initial question of power, it must be conceded that nothing \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 234]\n\u00a0\n in the statute provides for refunds when a sale has been approved without qualification; but approval in the present instances had not become final for want of judicial review, and an equitable power to order refunds may fairly be implied.\n\nThe measure of refunds is another matter. The Commission has now directed that the producers repay the difference between the amounts collected over four to six years and the figure it has now established as the original in-line price.\n5\n Since the in-line price has been fixed without reference to cost evidence and falls below the opening levels set in the negotiated contracts, the producers may well be receiving less than cost, as some of them expressly claim; and this imposed revision downward of prices covers not six months but a period of years.\n\nThe obvious refund formula, implicated by the statute itself and adopted by the Court of Appeals, would call for repayment of all amounts collected in excess of the \"just and reasonable\" price; that price, measured under 4 and 5, naturally takes due account of costs. The Government retorts that producers have no \"right\" to sell their gas for a \"just and reasonable\" price under the statute, a proposition perhaps true in the limited sense that the public convenience and necessity might yet exclude fair-profit sales by a uniquely high cost producer or in the face of a glutted market. No attempt is made, however, to class the present facts with such imaginable situations. Nor is advance exclusion from the interstate \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 235]\n\u00a0\n market so fearsome as an unexpected repricing of a completed sale depriving the seller of profit or costs.\n\nOn the present facts the Government has failed to point to any public interest overriding the potent claims of the producers to a fair return on their past four to six years of sales. Any triggering caused by the amounts previously charged has already spent its force and cannot be undone. Unconvincingly, the Government implies the producers may be comparatively well off with the present formula because it provides a final figure now and the \"just and reasonable\" price might prove to be below the in-line price; however, instant certainty as to past prices is no great gain since taxes and royalties have already been paid, and the chance that producers may get more than they deserve by following the in-line price is not a substitute for assuring them a fair return. About the only concrete advantage cited by the Government for the in-line price is that it speeds refunds to consumers. Assuming that a compromise cannot be reached as in other cases,\n6\n elaborate cost data should become available in the next year or two with the completion of the southern Louisiana area rate proceeding. Consumers, who assuredly expected no refunds when they paid their gas bills as long ago as six years, certainly do not suffer seriously in waiting a bit longer for refunds that individually must be minute in most cases.\n\nThe incongruity of the Commission's refund formula is well portrayed by considering what would have happened if the Commission had originally granted the certificates now thought proper by this Court. By accepting certificates conditioning sales at the in-line price, the producers \n\n[382 \nU.S. 223, 236]\n\u00a0\n could immediately have filed for increases, suffering at most a six-month delay. Even if the Commission's moratorium survived, the ceiling during this four-to-six-year period would have been 23.55 cents rather than the 18.5-cent figure now imposed. Thus, even had the Commission not erred in the first instance in favor of the producers, they still could have collected payments well in excess of 18.5 cents subject only to the ultimate finding of a \"just and reasonable\" price now denied them by the Commission.\n\nIn line with the foregoing discussion, I would uphold the Commission's decision fixing an in-line price, remand the case for further findings on the triggering price for a moratorium if the Commission wishes to pursue the point, and set aside the refund with leave to order repayments based on the \"just and reasonable\" price.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section citations herein are all to the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 717-717w (1964 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See the majority's note 3, ante, p. 228.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Petition of the FPC for Certiorari, p. 15, n. 14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This precise ground of attack upon the moratorium was set forth by at least one producer.

CO.(1965)\nNo. 489\nArgued: March 31, 1965Decided: May 17, 1965\n\n\n\n\n The Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 provides for the division of an insurance company's investment income into two parts, the policyholders' share (to be added to reserves for payment of future claims), and the company's share, with a pro rata allocation of each item of income to each share including tax-exempt interest. Only the company's share is subject to the tax and from this share the Act permits a deduction of its pro rata amount of tax-exempt interest to arrive at taxable income. The Act contains exceptions where the application of the definition of taxable investment income results in the imposition of tax on \"any interest which under section 103 is excluded from gross income\" - interest earned on state and municipal bonds - in which case an adjustment shall be made to prevent such imposition. Respondent claims that it is entitled to deduct from total income both the full amount of the policyholders' share and the full amount of exempt interest received; otherwise, by assigning part of the exempt interest to the policyholders' share, the statute would place more taxable income in the company's share and thus the company would pay more tax because it has received tax-exempt interest, since it must allocate a portion thereof to the reserve account. Respondent sued in District Court for a refund claiming an adjustment under the statutory exceptions and asserting that the treatment of tax-exempt interest was unconstitutional and contrary to National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, and Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n. The District Court rejected these claims but the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: There is no statutory or constitutional barrier to the application in this case of the pro rata formula set forth in the Act to compute respondent's taxable income, and the statutory exceptions are not applicable. Pp. 239-251.\n\n (a) The legislative history clearly shows that Congress intended the pro rata formula to be of general application and that Congress did not consider it to lay a tax on exempt interest in the usual case, such as this one. Pp. 239-242. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) This tax is not inconsistent with the rule of National Life, supra, that \"one may not be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property solely because he owns some that is free,\" since the displacement of taxable income with exempt income under the formula reduces the tax base and the burden per taxable dollar remains the same. Pp. 243-244.\n\n\n (c) The extension of the rule of National Life in Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, supra, was unexplained and was not followed in Denman v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514\n, decided but one term after Gehner, and Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371\n, which hold that disallowance of an expense attributable to the production of nontaxable income is not to impose an impermissible tax on the exempt receipts. Pp. 244-247.\n\n\n (d) Respondent has an obligation to set aside each year a large portion of its income for the benefit of policyholders, from whom it obtains most of its funds; the policyholders' claim against income is sufficiently direct and immediate to justify treating a major portion of income not as income to the company but as income to the policyholders. Pp. 247-248.\n\n\n (e) The pro rata formula treats taxable and exempt income in the same way, deeming that both are saddled with an equal share of the company's obligation to policyholders. It does no more than charge the exempt income with a fair share of the burdens properly allocable to it, which is permissible under Denman and Independent Life, supra. Pp. 249-251.\n\n\n 333 F.2d 389, reversed.\n\nSolicitor General Cox argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, Wayne G.

Ward and Charles E. Norman.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959,\n1\n which represents a comprehensive overhaul of the laws relating to the taxation of life insurance companies, places a tax upon taxable investment income and upon one-half the amount by which total gain from operations exceeds taxable investment income.\n2\n In arriving at taxable investment income and gain from operations, the 1959 Act, consistent with prior law in this regard, recognizes that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n life insurance companies are required by law to maintain policyholder reserves to meet future claims, that they normally add to these reserves a large portion of their investment income and that these annual reserve increments should not be subjected to tax. The question in this case is whether the method by which Congress chose to deal with these annual reserve increments and to arrive at taxable investment income places an impermissible tax on the interest earned by life insurance companies from municipal bonds, within the meaning of the Act itself and the relevant cases in this Court.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe 1959 Act defines life insurance company reserves,\n3\n provides a rather intricate method for establishing the amount which for tax purposes is deemed to be added each year to these reserves\n4\n and in 804 prescribes a division \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n of the investment income of an insurance company into two parts, the policyholders' share and the company's share.\n5\n More specifically, the total amount to be added to the reserve - the policy and other contract liability requirements - is divided by the total investment yield\n6\n and the resulting percentage is used to allocate each item of investment income, including tax-exempt interest, partly to the policyholders and partly to the company. In this case, approximately 85% of each item of income was assigned to the policyholders and was, as the Act provides, excluded from the company's taxable income. The remainder of each item is considered to be the company's share of investment income. From the total amount allocated to the company the Act allows a deduction of the company's share of tax-exempt interest (and of other nontaxed items) to arrive at taxable investment income.\n7\n The taxable investment income for the purposes \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n of arriving at the portion of gain from operations which is to be subjected to tax is arrived at by much the same process as above described.\n\nSection 804 (a) (6), however, provides as follows:\n\n \"(6) Exception. - If it is established in any case that the application of the definition of taxable investment income contained in paragraph (2) results in the imposition of tax on -\n\n\n \"(A) any interest which under section 103 is excluded from gross income,\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"adjustment shall be made to the extent necessary to prevent such imposition.\"\n\n\n An identical exception is contained in 809 (b) (4) providing for the calculation of gain from operation. Section 103 of the Code provides for the exclusion from gross income of the interest earned on state and municipal bonds.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner, the company's income from investments includes only its pro rata share of tax-exempt interest and since this share is fully deductible by the company, the law imposes no tax at all on exempt interest. Atlas, however, claims otherwise: The company is entitled to deduct from total investment income both the full amount of the annual addition to reserves and the full amount of exempt interest received; by assigning part of exempt interest to the reserve account rather than assigning only taxable income, the Act necessarily places more taxable income in the company's share of investment return; the company thus pays more tax because it has received tax-exempt interest of which a portion must be allocated to the reserve account.\n\nClaiming that it was entitled to the adjustments provided for in 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4), the company sued for a refund in the District Court. The complaint \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n also alleged the treatment accorded tax-exempt interest was contrary to the Constitution of the United States and to the principles set forth in National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, and Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n. The District Court rejected these claims, 216 F. Supp. 457 (D.C. N. D. Okla.), but the Court of Appeals reversed, 333 F.2d 389 (C. A. 10th Cir.). That court considered the 1959 formula to impose a tax on tax-exempt interest within the meaning of the National Life and Gehner cases and hence by the terms of 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4) an adjustment was required. We granted certiorari to consider this important question relating to the taxation of life insurance companies. \n379 \nU.S. 927\n.\n\nWe reverse, holding that in the circumstances of this case there is no statutory or constitutional barrier to the application of the formula provided in 804 to arrive at the taxable investment income of Atlas and hence the exceptions provided in 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4) are not applicable.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nUnder the 1959 Act the undivided part of a life insurance company's assets represented by its reserves is considered as a fund held for the benefit of the policyholders. The required annual addition to reserve is drawn from the income earned from investments of the commingled assets. Each item of investment income, including tax-exempt interest, is divided into a policyholders' share and a company's share. The policyholders' share is added to the reserve, is excluded for tax purposes from the gross income of the company and is not taxed to either the company or the policyholders. The company's share of investment income is then reduced by its share of tax-exempt interest to arrive at taxable investment income. It is apparent from the face of the Act that this is the formula which Congress intended to be of general application \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n and that Congress did not consider the application of the formula in the usual case to lay a tax on exempt interest, or to have any such effect, so as to bring the exception clauses into operation. Otherwise the exception would become the rule and the general formula of little, if any, utility.\n\nThis view of the section is fully supported by its legislative history. As H. R. 4245 came to the Senate after passage by the House, it provided for deducting the annual addition to reserves, but to prevent a \"double deduction\" reduced the deduction by a portion of tax-exempt interest.\n8\n This treatment of tax-exempt interest was one of many subjects of comment in the extensive hearings which followed before the Senate Committee on Finance. It was repeatedly and strongly argued by many that life insurance companies were entitled to deduct in full both the annual addition to reserves and the entire amount of tax-exempt interest, that the provisions of H. R. 4245 with regard to tax-exempt interest discriminated against the insurance companies, that the section was constitutionally invalid under the National Life and Gehner cases and that the formula would have adverse consequences on the municipal bond market.\n9\n Other witnesses, however, including those representing the Treasury Department, supported the bill and considered it to accord proper and constitutionally permissible treatment to municipal bond interest.\n10\n It is very doubtful that there remained at the conclusion of the hearings any unexplored facts or legal arguments concerning this aspect of the bill. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Senate Committee, with the hearings behind it, reported out a bill with amendments which, among other things, took a decidedly different approach to the ascertainment of the annual addition to reserves and to the handling of tax-exempt interest. This approach was essentially that which is contained in the statute as described above.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nAs time and again stated in the Committee Report and by those who presented the bill on the floor of the Senate, the purpose of the formula provided by the Senate was to avoid taxing exempt interest.\n12\n Senator Byrd, the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n Committee chairman, stated that \"[i]n providing the formula I have described to the Senate it was the intention of the committee not to impose any tax on tax-exempt interest.\" 105 Cong. Rec. 8401. It is extremely difficult to read the hearings, the reports, and the debates without concluding that in the opinion of Congress the formula it provided, without adjustment under 804 (a) (6) or 809 (b) (4), did not impose a tax on exempt interest in either the statutory or constitutional sense.\n\nNone of the materials called to our attention, however, explain why or for what purpose 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4) were added to the Act, save for mere recitations in the reports and the debates that an adjustment would be required in any case where tax-exempt interest was shown to be subjected to tax.\n13\n It may be that Congress thought that peculiar facts and circumstances in particular cases would require different treatment than the general formula would provide. If this was the case, no examples or illustrations of these aberrational situations were referred to or explained. And if this was to be the sole function of 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4) the Commissioner is surely entitled to a judgment, for there is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n nothing in this record indicating that this case is anything but the typical one to which Congress intended to apply the general formula.\n\nAtlas, however, in effect views 804 (a) (6) and 809 (b) (4) as built-in safety valves to be triggered and become fully operational by a final determination in a lawsuit, such as this one, that the new formula, contrary to the judgment of Congress, does indeed place a tax on exempt interest within the meaning of the relevant cases heretofore decided by this Court. This is not an unreasonable view of the purposes which Congress may have had in writing the exception provisions into the Act, but we cannot agree with Atlas or the Court of Appeals that National Life, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, and Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n, provide the necessary triggering to bring these clauses into play.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIn National Life, the Court struck down a provision of the federal income tax law which permitted insurance companies to exclude municipal bond interest from their gross income and at the same time reduce the reserve deduction otherwise available to the company by the full amount of the exempt interest which was excluded from gross income, the result being that the company paid as much tax as it would have paid had the same total income been entirely from taxable sources. Under that provision, a company shifting its investments from taxable to nontaxable securities would have lowered neither its taxable income nor its total tax. As compared with the company deriving its income only from taxable sources, the enterprise with the same total amount of investment income derived partly from exempt and partly from taxable sources would pay more tax per dollar of taxable gross income, i. e., taxable income before deduction for the reserve. Unable to perceive any purpose in reducing one deduction by the full amount of another, save for an \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n intent to impose a tax on exempt receipts, the Court ruled that \"[o]ne may not be subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property solely because he owns some that is free.\" \n277 \nU.S., at 519\n.\n\nIt is obvious that this is not the case under the 1959 Act. Here, a company receiving income from both exempt and nonexempt securities pays not the same, but less, tax than the company with an identical amount of gross income derived from only taxable sources. As the taxpayer displaces taxable income with exempt income, the size of the tax base, and the tax, are reduced. The tax burden per taxable dollar of taxable gross income does not increase, but remains the same.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nBut Atlas urges that the rule of National Life, when read in conjunction with Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n, means that a tax is imposed on tax-exempt interest whenever the liability of the taxpayer receiving such interest is greater than it would have been if the tax-exempt interest had not been received. In the Gehner case a state ad valorem property tax was imposed on the net personal property of an insurance company. Exempt government bonds were excluded from the tax base but only 84% - the ratio of taxable assets to total assets - of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 245]\n\u00a0\n the legally required reserves was allowed as a deduction. The Court considered National Life to hold that \"a State may not subject one to a greater burden upon his taxable property merely because he owns tax-exempt government securities.\" \n281 \nU.S., at 321\n. This paraphrase of the National Life holding was correct and states the principle for which both of these cases have been cited.\n15\n But it is obvious that the tax in Gehner did not infringe this rule. Reducing the reserve deduction by the ratio of taxable assets to total assets did not result in an increased tax burden on taxable property. The Court, nevertheless, invalidated the tax because \"the ownership of United States bonds is made the basis of denying the full exemption which is accorded to those who own no such bonds.\" \n281 \nU.S., at 321\n-322. The company was apparently to have the full benefit of both the exclusion of the government bonds and the deduction for the full amount of policyholder reserves. Otherwise, the law would not disregard the ownership of the bonds in exacting the tax. The Gehner case does, therefore, condemn more than an increase in the tax rate on taxable dollars for those owning exempt securities.\n\nThis extension of National Life was soon repudiated.\n16\n In Denman v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514\n, decided but one Term after Gehner, the Court unanimously upheld 214 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which permitted the deduction of interest generally except interest on \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 246]\n\u00a0\n indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry tax-exempt securities, as applied to a dealer in securities whose disallowed interest incurred to carry exempt bonds exceeded the return from the bonds. Although the parties argued both Gehner and National Life, the Court did not mention Gehner and said National Life was radically different, since the dealer \"was not in effect required to pay more upon his taxable receipts than was demanded of others who enjoyed like incomes solely because he was the recipient of interest from tax-free securities.\" \n282 \nU.S., at 519\n. But he was, like the taxpayer in Gehner, required to pay a greater tax than would be the case if the exempt securities were ignored entirely; absent ownership of the exempt bonds, the disallowed interest would have been deductible from taxable income. Ownership of exempt bonds was indeed the \"basis of denying the full exemption which is accorded to those who own no such bonds.\" Gehner, \n281 \nU.S., at 321\n-322. Thus the Court not only refused to follow the implications of Gehner in the context of the federal income tax, but also sustained the propriety of disallowing an expense attributable to the production of nontaxable income. Such disallowance was not to impose an impermissible burden on the exempt receipts. \"While guaranteed exemptions must be strictly observed, this obligation is not inconsistent with reasonable classification designed to subject all to the payment of their just share of a burden fairly imposed.\" \n282 \nU.S., at 519\n.\n\nThe Court followed Denman, and again distinguished National Life, without mentioning Gehner, in Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371\n, where the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 permitted deduction of depreciation and expenses of buildings owned by life insurance companies only if the company included in its gross income the rental value of space it occupied. The Court assumed that the rental value was not income, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 247]\n\u00a0\n and could not constitutionally be taxed, but upheld the measure as a valid apportionment of expenses attributable to the space occupied by the company and the space for which rents are received. Denman v. Slayton was said to make clear the distinction between a permissible exclusion from deductions of the amount attributable to exempt income and a tax on exempt property. This apportionment fell within the former and did not lay a tax on the rental value of the owner's use of his building.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nWe affirm the principle announced in Denman and Independent Life that the tax laws may require tax-exempt income to pay its way. In our view, Congress has done no more in the 1959 Act than to particularize this principle in connection with taxing the income of life insurance companies.\n\nAn insurance company obtains most of its funds from premiums paid to it by policyholders in exchange for the company's promise to pay future death claims and other benefits. The company is also obligated to maintain reserves, which, if they are to be adequate to pay future claims, must grow at a sufficient rate each year. The receipt of premiums necessarily entails the creation of reserves and additions to reserves from investment income. Thus the insurance company is not only permitted to invest, but it must invest; and it must return to the reserve a large portion of its investment income. As no insurance company would deny, there is sufficient economic and legal substance to the company's obligation to return a large portion of investment income to policyholder reserves to warrant or require the exclusion of investment income so employed from the taxable income of the company. And we think the policyholders' claim against investment income is sufficiently direct and immediate to justify the Congress in treating a major \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 248]\n\u00a0\n part of investment income not as income to the company but as income to the policyholders. Whether viewed as income to the policyholders, or, as Atlas would have it, as the principal cost of carrying on the business which produces the company's net investment income,\n17\n a large \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 249]\n\u00a0\n portion of total investment income is credited to the reserve and eliminated from taxable investment income.\n\nUnder the 1959 Act this portion is arrived at by subjecting each dollar of investment income, whatever its source, to a pro rata share of the obligation owed by the company to the policyholders, from whom the invested funds are chiefly obtained. In our view, there is nothing inherently arbitrary or irrational in such a formula for setting aside that share of investment income which must be committed to the reserves. Undoubtedly policyholders have not contracted to have assigned to them either taxable or exempt dollars. Their claim can be fully satisfied with either, but it runs against all investment income, whatever its source. We see no sound reason, legal or economic, for distinguishing between the taxable and nontaxable dollar or for saying that the reserve must be satisfied by resort to taxable income alone. Interest on municipal bonds may be exempt from tax, but this does not carry with it exemption from the company's obligation to add a large portion of investment income to policyholder reserve.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTax exemption cannot change the substance of this undertaking. And the statutory formula allocating so much of each dollar of investment income as the reserve increment bears to total investment income is quite clearly consistent with it. For the formula treats taxable and exempt income in the same way, deeming that both are saddled with an equal share of the company's obligation to policyholders. We think that Congress can treat the receipts from investment of a pool of fungible assets in this manner and that the taxpayer's desired allocation of these receipts is not constitutionally required.\n\nIt is said, however, that a company investing \"idle\" assets in municipal bonds and thereby adding exempt interest to its income will pay more tax, and at a higher rate per dollar of taxable income, than if it had not made the additional investment at all. Likewise, it is claimed, two companies having the same amount of investment in taxable securities and the same amount of commitments to policyholders, but one having some municipal securities in addition, will have a different tax bill, the latter paying more tax and at a higher rate because of the ownership of the bonds. But insurance companies accumulate funds to invest and they must, and do, invest. Their choice is not between investing and not investing at all but between investing in one kind of securities or another. Under the 1959 formula investing in exempt securities results in a lower total tax than investing in taxable securities and the tax rate per taxable dollar does not increase. It is likewise unrealistic to compare the tax burdens of two companies, each with the same amount of taxable income but one with exempt income in addition, and to assume in the comparison that each has the same obligation to augment reserves. The likelihood is that if the one company has additional exempt income which the other does not have, it also has more assets, larger reserves and a greater reserve claim against investment \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 251]\n\u00a0\n income, which will reduce taxable income and substantially offset the alleged disparity in tax burden between the two companies.\n\nUndoubtedly the 1959 Act does not wholly ignore the receipt of tax-exempt interest in arriving at taxable investment income. The formula does pre-empt a share of tax-exempt interest for policyholders and the company will pay more than it would if it had the full benefit of the exclusion for reserve additions and at the same time could reduce taxable income by the full amount of exempt interest. But this result necessarily follows from the application of the principle of charging exempt income with a fair share of the burdens properly allocable to it. In the last analysis Atlas' insistence on both the full reserve and exempt-income exclusions is tantamount to saying that those who purchase exempt securities instead of taxable ones are constitutionally entitled to reduce their tax liability and to pay less tax per taxable dollar than those owning no such securities. The doctrine of intergovernmental immunity does not require such a benefit to be conferred on the ownership of municipal bonds. Congress was entitled to allocate investment income to policyholders as it did. The formula \"was designed to subject all to the payment of their just share of a burden fairly imposed,\" Denman, supra, at 519, and as applied to this case did not impose a tax on income excludable under 103 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 73 Stat. 112, Int. Rev. Code 801-820.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Act provides a three-phase procedure for taxation of life insurance companies. Under phase one the tax base represents the life insurance company's share of income from interest, dividends, rents, royalties, and other investment sources less investment expenses and deduction of the company's share of exempt interest and other items. 804. Under phase two the tax base represents 50% of the excess of total net income from all sources - \"gain from operations\" - over taxable investment income. This excess, referred to as underwriting gain, consists of mortality and loading savings, i. e., savings resulting from fewer deaths per age group than were assumed in establishing premiums and reserves and any reduced expenses in servicing policies. 809. It also may include a portion of investment income which is not taxed under phase one, since in calculating the amount of investment income to be allocated to policyholders under phase two, the reserves are multiplied by the company's required interest rate rather than the company's average or current earnings rate used in phase one. 809 (a). This difference is minimized by other adjustments to the reserve under phase one whenever the applicable earnings rate exceeds or is less than the assumed rate. See note 4, infra. If there is underwriting loss under phase two, the entire loss is deducted from the taxable investment income as computed under phase one. If there is gain, half of this gain is added to the phase one tax base.\n\nPhase three imposes a tax on certain underwriting gains made available to shareholders which are not taxed under phase two. 815.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Int. Rev. Code 801 (b) (1).\n\nLife insurance reserves may be defined simply as that fund which, together with future premiums and interest will be sufficient to pay future claims. Under the statute such reserves are defined as amounts computed or estimated on the basis of recognized mortality tables and assumed rates of interest, set aside to mature or liquidate future claims arising from life, annuity, and noncancellable health and accident insurance policies, and required by law, with some exceptions not pertinent here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Int. Rev. Code 805.\n\nThis amount is called the \"policy and other contract liability requirements\" and is determined by a series of calculations. The company's \"adjusted life insurance reserves\" are multiplied by the current earnings rate or the average earnings rate for the current and four preceding years, whichever is lower. \"Adjusted life insurance reserves\" are the life insurance reserves required by law adjusted for the difference between the assumed interest rate used by the company in computing such reserves and the actual earnings rate. The reserve is reduced by 10% for every 1% by which the applicable earnings rate exceeds the company's assumed interest rate. To the amount so calculated are added pension plan reserves multiplied by the current earnings rate and interest paid during the taxable year.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Int. Rev. Code 804 (a) (1):\n\n\"Exclusion of policyholders' share of investment yield. - The policyholders' share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) of any life insurance company shall not be included in taxable investment income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the policyholders' share of any item shall be that percentage obtained by dividing the policy and other contract liability requirements by the investment yield; except that if the policy and other contract liability requirements exceed the investment yield, then the policyholders' share of any item shall be 100 percent.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Investment yield is gross investment income less specified deductions, including investment expenses, real estate expenses, depreciation, depletion and trade and business expenses, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. Int. Rev. Code 804 (b), (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Included in the investment yield which is divided between the policyholders and company, in addition to interest on state and municipal bonds, are partially nontaxed interest on federal bonds and intracorporate dividends. Section 804 (a) (2) permits deduction of the company's nontaxed share of these items along with interest on exempt bonds.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] H. R. Rep.

R. 4245, the Committee on Finance was of the opinion that the formula provided in 804 did not impose a tax on tax-exempt interest - \"[t]he purpose of your committee in providing this treatment is to exempt a life insurance company from tax on any tax-exempt interest . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 17. See also pp. 6, 18, 46.\n\nSenator Byrd in explaining the bill to the Senate presented a letter from the Department of the Treasury which said that the formula provided by the bill did not place a tax on exempt interest, that the additional language of 804 (a) (6) establishing an exception was not at all necessary but that just to make sure it had been provided that in any case the formula resulted in taxing interest excludable under 103, an adjustment would be made. 105 Cong. Rec. 8402. The more detailed explanation of the bill by Senator Byrd was to the same effect. 105 Cong. Rec. 8404. Senator Curtis, a member of the Senate Committee, delivered a comprehensive speech in support of the bill in the course of which he said that his earlier concern about inadvertently taxing exempt interest had been fully met by the bill. After reviewing the formula, with examples illustrating its operation and without mentioning the exception of 804 (a) (6) he remarked that \"no tax-exempt income or credits of life insurance companies will be included in the tax base of such companies, under this bill. This should allay any fear that any constitutional provision is transgressed.\" 105 Cong. Rec. 8429. The bill passed in the Senate, 105 Cong. Rec. 8438, and the Conference Report, which \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n may be said to have adopted the Senate approach to the problem involved in this case, H. R. Rep. No. 520, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 4, 14-15, 105 Cong. Rec. 10412, was adopted by both Houses.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See S. Rep. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 17, 24; H. R. Rep. No. 520, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 15; 105 Cong. Rec. 8401, 10400, 10412-10414. Representative Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated:\n\n\"As agreed to by the conferees, the final version of H. R. 4245 extensively rewrites the provisions of the House bill dealing with tax-exempt interest and dividends received, including the addition of a proviso to the effect that if in any particular case the formula under the bill does not provide the proper treatment of these items, appropriate adjustment will be made. It is my belief that the appropriate deduction was allowed by the House bill and that these provisions of the final bill, which closely follow the Senate amendment, make no change of substance.\" 105 Cong. Rec. 10412.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Where income from taxable sources is displaced by the same amount of income from exempt bonds, the total investment yield and the reserve exclusion remain the same. Thus the proportion of each item of income allocated to the policyholders' share and the company's share also remains the same. Since the amount of exempt income allocated to the company is larger and that share is fully deductible, the tax base is correspondingly smaller.\n\nThe result is a decrease in the tax commensurate with the extent to which the company's taxable income is taxed. With a fully taxable investment yield of $1,000,000 and a policyholders' share of $800,000, 20% of the investment yield would be included in gain from operations. Gain from operations would be reduced by 20% of any part of the investment yield that was shifted from taxable income to tax-exempt income.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See, e. g., Denman v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514, 519\n; Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371, 381\n; Schuylkill Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n296 \nU.S. 113, 119\n; New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals, \n338 \nU.S. 665, 674\n-675, 677.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] This is true insofar as Gehner rested on a doctrine of implied constitutional immunity. The tax there was a state ad valorem property tax said to be on federal bonds and then, as now, a federal statute insulated such bonds from state taxation. See 73 Stat. 622, 105 (a), 31 U.S.C. 742 (1958 ed., Supp. V).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The statement of Stanford Rothschild, a representative of one of the life insurance companies objecting to the proposed pro rata disallowance of the reserve deduction in H. R. 4245, before the Senate Committee provides a clear exposition of this view:\n\n\"Life insurance companies have two kinds of gross investment income: On the one hand, there is the income which has to be set aside to cover actual expenses and the liabilities to the policyholders. On the other hand, there is free investment income, not needed for the operation of the company; this excess income is fully taxable.\n\n\n\"All tax laws dealing with life insurance companies have allowed deductions from income for required interest. Even the excise tax formulas have provided for such deductions. The basic reason for this deduction is that required interest cannot be construed to be true income or profit, just as the cost of goods sold by a merchant must be eliminated from his gross income.\" Hearings on H. R. 4245 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 696-697.\n\n\n Under this view of the reserve increment, we think this case is strikingly similar to Denman v. Slayton. On this theory the reserve increment is an accrued expense in the nature of interest on the funds obtained from policyholders for investment, and the denial of that part of the deduction which exempt income bears to total investment receipts represents disallowance of an expense attributable to the production of exempt income, which is precisely what Denman permits. It is argued, however, that the rule of Denman disallowing deduction of exempt interest is limited to \"but for\" situations: Interest incurred on loans used to purchase exempt bonds may be disallowed only where there would have been no interest charge except for the purchase of exempt securities. It is by no means clear that this is not the case here, for there is a relationship between the amount of the reserve increment, representing interest on funds obtained from policyholders, and the amount of a company's investments, exempt or otherwise, unless it be assumed that a company does not sell policies and obtain funds for the purpose of investment. However this may be, we do not read Denman so narrowly. We think interest can be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 249]\n\u00a0\n said to be incurred or continued as a cost of producing exempt income whenever a taxpayer borrows for the purpose of making investments and in fact invests funds in exempt securities.\n\nThere was no problem of allocating interest in Denman, but surely no one doubts that the case would not have been any different if the dealer there borrowed and purchased taxable securities with half the loan and used the other half to purchase exempt securities.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] There is nothing to the argument that since the reserve obligation remains the same whether there is exempt income or not, no part of the obligation is fairly chargeable to exempt income. It could as well be argued that because the reserve requirement is the same whether there is taxable income or not, none of the reserve increment may be obtained by pre-empting taxable income. The fact is that the annual addition to reserve must be made up from investment income, whatever its source, and the company owes to its policyholders a share of the tax-exempt dollar fully as much and in the same sense that it owes a part of the taxable dollar. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 233, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Holding that 10 applies to a \"then present legal interest,\" and not one dependent on the outcome of an illegal plan, the District Court dismissed the indictment Held:\n\n 1. Under the strict construction applicable to a criminal statute, the words \"substantial interest\" in 10 presuppose, not bribery (which the indictment here in effect charges) under a conflict of interest law, but either an existing investment in the purchaser, the creation of the purchaser for the use of those acting for the seller, or a joint venture or continued course of dealings for profit sharing with the purchaser, each of which would be within the concept of this antitrust statute.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. 3731, from the District Court's order dismissing Count I of an indictment (225 F. Supp. 577) for failure to state an offense under 10 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 734, 15 U.S.C. 20. That section provides in relevant part:\n\n \"No common carrier engaged in commerce shall have any dealings in securities, supplies, or other articles of commerce, or shall make or have any contracts for construction or maintenance of any kind, to the amount of more than $50,000, in the aggregate, in any one year, with another corporation, firm, partnership, or association when the said common carrier shall have upon its board of directors or as its president, manager, or as its purchasing or selling officer, or agent in the particular transaction, any person who is at the same time a director, manager, or purchasing or selling officer of, or who has any substantial interest in, such other corporation, firm, partnership, or association, unless and except such purchases shall be made from, or such dealings shall be with, the bidder whose bid is the most favorable to such common carrier, to be ascertained by competitive bidding under regulations to be prescribed by rule or otherwise by the Interstate Commerce Commission. . . .\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n Count I charged that appellee railroad and the three other appellees, officers of the railroad, violated 10 by the road's sale on August 14, 1958, of 10 coaches valued in excess of $50,000 to the International Railway Equipment Corp. in which the three officers had \"a substantial interest.\" competitive bidding not having been used. That count charged that appellee McGinnis knowingly voted \n\n[380 \nU.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n for the sale and that all three appellee officers knowingly directed the act. A bill of particulars\n1\n described the \"substantial interest\" of those officers in the purchasing corporation as follows:\n\n \"The substantial interest of defendants McGinnis and Glacy in defendant International consisted of an understanding, agreement, relationship, arrangement and concert of action among the said defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and International, and others, for, among other things, the purpose of producing profits for International from dealings by it in property acquired from the B&M through the intervention, direction or assistance of defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and Benson, and pursuant to which defendants McGinnis, Glacy, and Benson were to and did receive substantial monies.\"\n\n\n The District Court held:\n\n\"The statute is limited to one who has a then present legal interest in the buying corporation and does not include one whose only interest is in the outcome of what may have been an illegal and illicit plan to siphon off for his personal benefit property of the Boston and Maine Railroad through the medium of International.\" 225 F. Supp., at 578. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 157, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n A criminal statute is to be construed strictly, not loosely. Such are the teachings of our cases from United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, down to this day. Chief Justice Marshall said in that case:\n\n \"The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is, perhaps, not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\" Id., p. 95.\n\n\n The fact that a particular activity may be within the same general classification and policy of those covered does not necessarily bring it within the ambit of the criminal prohibition. United States v. Weitzel, \n246 \nU.S. 533\n.\n\nWhat is the reach of 10? It is not strictly a conflict of interest statute such as we dealt with in United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., \n364 \nU.S. 520\n. In Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 173, 190\n, we described 10 as \"an antitrust law.\"\n\nSection 10, indeed, has its roots in President Wilson's message to Congress of January 20, 1914, on the subject of \"trusts,\" in which he denounced the abuses of \"interlockings of the personnel of the directorates of great corporations.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 1962-1964; H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 17-18. Section 10 started as part of 9 of the House bill and forbade certain types of interlocking office-holding. See S. Doc. No. 584, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10. The Senate made two main changes. First, it did not prohibit interlocking office-holding but seized rather on competitive bidding as the control. S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 47-48. Second, the Senate required competitive bidding not only when a director or other officer or agent of a common carrier was also a director or other officer of any firm with which the carrier had dealings to the amount of more than \n\n[380 \nU.S. 157, 161]\n\u00a0\n $50,000 in any one year, but also when the director or other officer of a common carrier had \"any direct or indirect interest in\" the other firm. S. Doc. No. 584, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 13. The Conference changed the phrase \"any direct or indirect interest in\" to the present wording \"any substantial interest in.\" Id., pp. 13-14. As Senator Chilton, one of the Conferees, reported:\n\n \". . . It not only prevents corporations which are interlocked by officers and directors, but it says: `Or who has any substantial interest in such of them.'\n\n\n \"The Senator will recall all we had before us, the ease by which interlocking directorates could be gotten around; in other words, you could have your son, or your cousin, or your lawyer, or your agent upon the corporation and accomplish the same thing as if you were on the board yourself. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n  \". . . They can not dodge it by having a supply company, and even though they have discarded the form of interlocking directors, if there be the interest of the railroad or the common carrier in the supply company, as the Senator chooses to call it, then it is prohibited.\" 51 Cong. Rec. 15943.\n\n\n As we have seen, Count I charges a \"transaction\" to sell 10 coaches to International, and the bill of particulars suggests that it was agreed that the three individual appellees would receive \"substantial monies\" for their part in effecting the sale. It is earnestly urged that since those appellees stood to profit from the deal with International, they had a \"substantial interest in\" International within the meaning of 10. It is pointed out that the railroad scandals of that age were not limited to interlocking directorates and multiple shareholding, but that suppliers of railroad materials had made substantial gifts to the railroad officials with whom they dealt. See In re Financial Transactions of the New York, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 157, 162]\n\u00a0\n N. H. & H. R. Co., 31 I. C. C. 32.\n2\n But we are confined by the words that Congress used in 10. If the rule of strict construction is to be followed, the words \"substantial interest in,\" as used in 10, presuppose either an existing investment of some kind in International, or the creation of International by the three individual appellees for their use, or a joint venture or continued course of dealings, licit or illicit, with International for profit sharing. But it is doubtful that this indictment, as illuminated by the bill of particulars, alleges anything more in substance than a bribe. Bribery might well be in the family of offenses covered under a conflict of interest statute. But it is more remote from an antitrust frame of reference. While history shows a rather wide pattern of railroad misconduct leading to 10, that section is a rather narrow prohibition applicable to activity that is conceptually within the antitrust philosophy. We cannot broaden it to include the present case, unless we attribute to Congress a purpose to make it a more general panacea for conflict of interest activities; but neither do we take the same narrow view of the statute as the District Court.\n\nSince the Government may choose to file, and the District Court may choose to allow, an amended bill of particulars,\n3\n we vacate and remand the case, leaving open all questions except our construction of the statute.\n\n    Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This case was decided below and argued here on the assumption that, although the indictment itself was sufficient against a motion to dismiss, it became insufficient for that purpose by reason of the bill of particulars. We have held, however, that \"the bill of particulars . . . forms no part of the record for the purposes of the demurrer.\" United States v. Comyns, \n248 \nU.S. 349, 353\n (emphasis supplied); Dunlop v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486\n.

Wulf for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California et al., and by Victor Rabinowitz and Leonard B. Boudin for the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case we review for the first time a conviction under 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which makes it a crime for a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer or (except in clerical or custodial positions) as an employee of a labor union.\n1\n Section 504, the purpose of which is to protect \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n the national economy by minimizing the danger of political strikes,\n2\n was enacted to replace 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, which conditioned a union's access to the National Labor Relations Board upon the filing of affidavits by all of the union's officers attesting that they were not members of or affiliated with the Communist Party.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 440]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondent has been a working longshoreman on the San Francisco docks, and an open and avowed Communist, for more than a quarter of a century. He was elected to the Executive Board of Local 10 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union for consecutive one-year terms in 1959, 1960, and 1961. On May 24, 1961, respondent was charged in a one-count indictment returned in the Northern District of California with \"knowingly and wilfully serv[ing] as a member of an executive board of a labor organization . . . while a member of the Communist Party, in wilful violation of Title 29, United States Code, Section 504.\" It was neither charged nor proven that respondent at any time advocated or suggested illegal activity by the union, or proposed a political strike.\n4\n The jury found respondent guilty, and he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed and remanded with instructions to set aside the conviction and dismiss the indictment, holding that 504 violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. 334 F.2d 488. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 899\n.\n\nRespondent urges - in addition to the grounds relied on by the court below - that the statute under which he was convicted is a bill of attainder, and therefore violates Art. I, 9, of the Constitution.\n5\n We agree that 504 is void as a bill of attainder and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on that basis. We therefore find it unnecessary to consider the First and Fifth Amendment arguments. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 441]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe provisions outlawing bills of attainder were adopted by the Constitutional Convention unanimously, and without debate.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\"No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed [by the Congress].\" Art. I, 9, cl. 3. \"No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . .\" Art. I, 10.\n\n\n A logical starting place for an inquiry into the meaning of the prohibition is its historical background. The bill of attainder, a parliamentary act sentencing to death one or more specific persons, was a device often resorted to in sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century England for dealing with persons who had attempted, or threatened to attempt, to overthrow the government.\n7\n In addition to the death sentence, attainder generally carried with it a \"corruption of blood,\" which meant that the attainted party's heirs could not inherit his property.\n8\n The \"bill of pains and penalties\" was identical to the bill of attainder, except that it prescribed a penalty short of death,\n9\n e. g., banishment,\n10\n deprivation of the right to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 442]\n\u00a0\n vote,\n11\n or exclusion of the designated party's sons from Parliament.\n12\n Most bills of attainder and bills of pains and penalties named the parties to whom they were to apply; a few, however, simply described them.\n13\n While some left the designated parties a way of escaping the penalty, others did not.\n14\n The use of bills of attainder and bills of pains and penalties was not limited to England. During the American Revolution, the legislatures of all thirteen States passed statutes directed against the Tories; among these statutes were a large number of bills of attainder and bills of pains and penalties.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nWhile history thus provides some guidelines, the wide variation in form, purpose and effect of ante-Constitution bills of attainder indicates that the proper scope of the Bill of Attainder Clause, and its relevance to contemporary problems, must ultimately be sought by attempting to discern the reasons for its inclusion in the Constitution, and the evils it was designed to eliminate. The best available evidence, the writings of the architects of our constitutional system, indicates that the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended not as a narrow, technical (and therefore soon to be outmoded) prohibition, but rather as an implementation of the separation of powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function, or more simply - trial by legislature.\n\nThe Constitution divides the National Government into three branches - Legislative, Executive and Judicial. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 443]\n\u00a0\n This \"separation of powers\" was obviously not instituted with the idea that it would promote governmental efficiency. It was, on the contrary, looked to as a bulwark against tyranny. For if governmental power is fractionalized, if a given policy can be implemented only by a combination of legislative enactment, judicial application, and executive implementation, no man or group of men will be able to impose its unchecked will. James Madison wrote:\n\n\"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n The doctrine of separated powers is implemented by a number of constitutional provisions, some of which entrust certain jobs exclusively to certain branches, while others say that a given task is not to be performed by a given branch. For example, Article III's grant of \"the judicial Power of the United States\" to federal courts has been interpreted both as a grant of exclusive authority over certain areas, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, and as a limitation upon the judiciary, a declaration that certain tasks are not to be performed by courts, e. g., Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n. Compare Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 579\n.\n\nThe authors of the Federalist Papers took the position that although under some systems of government (most notably the one from which the United States had just broken), the Executive Department is the branch most likely to forget the bounds of its authority, \"in a representative republic . . . where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly . . . which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude; yet \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 444]\n\u00a0\n not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions . . .,\" barriers had to be erected to ensure that the legislature would not overstep the bounds of its authority and perform the functions of the other departments.\n17\n The Bill of Attainder Clause was regarded as such a barrier. Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n\"Nothing is more common than for a free people, in times of heat and violence, to gratify momentary passions, by letting into the government principles and precedents which afterwards prove fatal to themselves. Of this kind is the doctrine of disqualification, disfranchisement, and banishment by acts of the legislature. The dangerous consequences of this power are manifest. If the legislature can disfranchise any number of citizens at pleasure by general descriptions, it may soon confine all the votes to a small number of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or an oligarchy; if it may banish at discretion all those whom particular circumstances render obnoxious, without hearing or trial, no man can be safe, nor know when he may be the innocent victim of a prevailing faction. The name of liberty applied to such a government, would be a mockery of common sense.\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thus the Bill of Attainder Clause not only was intended as one implementation of the general principle of fractionalized power, but also reflected the Framers' belief that the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons.\n\n\"Every one must concede that a legislative body, from its numbers and organization, and from the very intimate dependence of its members upon the people, which renders them liable to be peculiarly susceptible to popular clamor, is not properly constituted to try with coolness, caution, and impartiality a criminal charge, especially in those cases in which the popular feeling is strongly excited, - the very class of cases most likely to be prosecuted by this mode.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 446]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n By banning bills of attainder, the Framers of the Constitution sought to guard against such dangers by limiting legislatures to the task of rule-making. \"It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments.\" Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIt is in this spirit that the Bill of Attainder Clause was consistently interpreted by this Court - until the decision in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n, which we shall consider hereafter. In 1810, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138, stated that \"[a] bill of attainder may affect the life of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both.\" This means, of course, that what were known at common law as bills of pains and penalties are outlawed by the Bill of Attainder Clause. The Court's pronouncement therefore served notice that the Bill of Attainder Clause was not to be given a narrow historical reading (which would exclude bills of pains and penalties), but was instead to be read in light of the evil the Framers had sought to bar: legislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups. See also Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286.\n\nThe approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333. Cummings involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union. At issue in Garland was a federal statute which required attorneys to take a similar oath before they could practice in federal courts. This Court struck down both provisions as bills of attainder on the ground that they were legislative acts inflicting punishment on a specific group: clergymen and lawyers who had taken part in the rebellion and therefore could not truthfully take the oath. In reaching its result, the Court emphatically rejected the argument that the constitutional \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 448]\n\u00a0\n prohibition outlawed only a certain class of legislatively imposed penalties:\n\n\"The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact. Disqualification from office may be punishment, as in cases of conviction upon impeachment. Disqualification from the pursuits of a lawful avocation, or from positions of trust, or from the privilege of appearing in the courts, or acting as an executor, administrator, or guardian, may also, and often has been, imposed as punishment.\" 4 Wall., at 320.\n\n\n The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause\n21\n came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303\n, where the Court invalidated 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1943, 57 Stat. 431, 450, which prohibited payment of further salary to three named federal employees,\n22\n as a bill of attainder.\n\n\"[L]egislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 449]\n\u00a0\n members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution. . . . This permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government is punishment, and of a most severe type. . . . No one would think that Congress could have passed a valid law, stating that after investigation it had found Lovett, Dodd, and Watson `guilty' of the crime of engaging in `subversive activities,' defined that term for the first time, and sentenced them to perpetual exclusion from any government employment. Section 304, while it does not use that language, accomplishes that result.\" Id., at 315-316.\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nUnder the line of cases just outlined, 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act plainly constitutes a bill of attainder. Congress undoubtedly possesses power under the Commerce Clause to enact \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 450]\n\u00a0\n legislation designed to keep from positions affecting interstate commerce persons who may use such positions to bring about political strikes. In 504, however, Congress has exceeded the authority granted it by the Constitution. The statute does not set forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics (acts and characteristics which, in Congress' view, make them likely to initiate political strikes) shall not hold union office, and leave to courts and juries the job of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possess the specified characteristics. Instead, it designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics and therefore cannot hold union office without incurring criminal liability - members of the Communist Party.\n24\n\u00a0\n\nCommunist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n, lends support to our conclusion. That case involved an appeal from an order by the Control Board ordering the Communist Party to register as a \"Communist-action organization,\" under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C. 781 et seq. (1958 ed.). The definition of \"Communist-action organization\" which the Board is to apply is set forth in 3 of the Act:\n\n\"[A]ny organization in the United States . . . which (i) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 451]\n\u00a0\n Communist movement . . . .\" 64 Stat. 989, 50 U.S.C. 782 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n A majority of the Court rejected the argument that the Act was a bill of attainder, reasoning that 3 does not specify the persons or groups upon which the deprivations set forth in the Act are to be imposed, but instead sets forth a general definition. Although the Board had determined in 1953 that the Communist Party was a \"Communist-action organization,\" the Court found the statutory definition not to be so narrow as to insure that the Party would always come within it:\n\n\"In this proceeding the Board has found, and the Court of Appeals has sustained its conclusion, that the Communist Party, by virtue of the activities in which it now engages, comes within the terms of the Act. If the Party should at any time choose to abandon these activities, after it is once registered pursuant to 7, the Act provides adequate means of relief.\" \n367 \nU.S., at 87\n.\n\n\n The entire Court did not share the view of the majority that 3's definition constituted rule-making rather than specification.\n25\n See also Garner v. Los Angeles Board, \n341 \nU.S. 716, 723\n. However, language incorporated in the majority opinion indicates that there was agreement on one point: by focusing upon \"the crucial constitutional significance of what Congress did when it rejected the approach of outlawing the Party by name and accepted instead a statutory program regulating not enumerated organizations but designated activities,\" \n367 \nU.S., at 84\n-85, the majority clearly implied that if the Act had applied to the Communist Party by name, it would have been a bill of attainder:\n\n \"The Act is not a bill of attainder. It attaches not to specified organizations but to described activities \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 452]\n\u00a0\n in which an organization may or may not engage. . . . The Subversive Activities Control Act . . . requires the registration only of organizations which, after the date of the Act, are found to be under the direction, domination, or control of certain foreign powers and to operate primarily to advance certain objectives. This finding must be made after full administrative hearing, subject to judicial review which opens the record for the reviewing court's determination whether the administrative findings as to fact are supported by the preponderance of the evidence.\" Id., at 86-87.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n In this case no disagreement over whether the statute in question designates a particular organization can arise, for 504 in terms inflicts its disqualification upon members of the Communist Party. The moment 504 was enacted, respondent was given the choice of declining a leadership position in his union or incurring criminal liability. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Solicitor General points out that in Board of Governors v. Agnew, \n329 \nU.S. 441\n, this Court applied 32 of the Banking Act of 1933, which provides:\n\n \"No officer, director, or employee of any corporation or unincorporated association, no partner or employee of any partnership, and no individual, primarily engaged in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, of stocks, bonds, or other similar securities, shall serve the same time as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank except in limited classes of cases in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may allow such service by general regulations when in the judgment of the said Board it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n He suggests that for purposes of the Bill of Attainder Clause, such conflict-of-interest laws\n28\n are not meaningfully distinguishable from the statute before us. We find this argument without merit. First, we note that 504, unlike 32 of the Banking Act, inflicts its deprivation upon the members of a political group thought to present a threat to the national security. As we noted above, such groups were the targets of the overwhelming majority of English and early American bills of attainder. Second, 32 incorporates no judgment censuring or condemning \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 454]\n\u00a0\n any man or group of men. In enacting it, Congress relied upon its general knowledge of human psychology, and concluded that the concurrent holding of the two designated positions would present a temptation to any man - not just certain men or members of a certain political party. Thus insofar as 32 incorporates a condemnation, it condemns all men. Third, we cannot accept the suggestion that 32 constitutes an exercise in specification rather than rule-making. It seems to us clear that 32 establishes an objective standard of conduct. Congress determined that a person who both (a) held a position in a bank which could be used to influence the investment policies of the bank or its customers, and (b) was in a position to benefit financially from investment in the securities handled by a particular underwriting house, might well be tempted to \"use his influence in the bank to involve it or its customers in securities which his underwriting house has in its portfolio or has committed itself to take.\" \n329 \nU.S., at 447\n. In designating bank officers, directors and employees as those persons in position (a), and officers, directors, partners and employees of underwriting houses as those persons in position (b), Congress merely expressed the characteristics it was trying to reach in an alternative, shorthand way.\n29\n That Congress was legislating with \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 455]\n\u00a0\n respect to general characteristics rather than with respect to a specific group of men is well demonstrated by the fact that 32 provides that the prescribed disqualification should not obtain whenever the Board of Governors determined that \"it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments.\" We do not suggest that such an escape clause is essential to the constitutionality of 32, but point to it only further to underscore the infirmity of the suggestion that 32, like 504, incorporates an empirical judgment of, and inflicts its deprivation upon, a particular group of men.\n\nIt is argued, however, that in 504 Congress did no more than it did in enacting 32: it promulgated a general rule to the effect that persons possessing characteristics which make them likely to incite political strikes should not hold union office, and simply inserted in place of a list of those characteristics an alternative, shorthand criterion - membership in the Communist Party. Again, we cannot agree. The designation of Communists as those persons likely to cause political strikes is not the substitution of a semantically equivalent phrase; on the contrary, it rests, as the Court in Douds explicitly recognized, \n339 \nU.S., at 389\n, upon an empirical investigation by Congress of the acts, characteristics and propensities of Communist Party members. In a number of decisions, this Court has pointed out the fallacy of the suggestion that membership in the Communist Party, or any other political organization, can be regarded as an alternative, but equivalent, expression for a list of undesirable characteristics. For, as the Court noted in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118, 136\n, \"under our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and . . . men in adhering to a political party or other organization notoriously do not subscribe unqualifiedly \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 456]\n\u00a0\n to all of its platforms or asserted principles.\"\n30\n Just last Term, in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n, we held 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act to violate the Constitution because it \"too broadly and indiscriminately\" restricted constitutionally protected freedoms. One of the factors which compelled us to reach this conclusion was that 6 inflicted its deprivation upon all members of Communist organizations without regard to whether there existed any demonstrable relationship between the characteristics of the person involved and the evil Congress sought to eliminate. Id., at 509-511. These cases are relevant to the question before us. Even assuming that Congress had reason to conclude that some Communists would use union positions to bring about political strikes, \"it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shar[e] their evil purposes or participat[e] in their illegal conduct.\" Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232, 246\n. In utilizing the term \"members of the Communist Party\" to designate those persons who are likely to incite political strikes, it plainly is not the case that Congress has merely substituted a convenient shorthand term for a list of the characteristics it was trying to reach.\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe Solicitor General argues that 504 is not a bill of attainder because the prohibition it imposes does not constitute \"punishment.\" In support of this conclusion, he urges that the statute was enacted for preventive rather \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 457]\n\u00a0\n than retributive reasons - that its aim is not to punish Communists for what they have done in the past, but rather to keep them from positions where they will in the future be able to bring about undesirable events. He relies on American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n, which upheld 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, the predecessor of the statute presently before us. In Douds the Court distinguished Cummings, Garland and Lovett on the ground that in those cases\n\n\"the individuals involved were in fact being punished for past actions; whereas in this case they are subject to possible loss of position only because there is substantial ground for the congressional judgment that their beliefs and loyalties will be transformed into future conduct.\" Id., at 413.\n\n\n This case is not necessarily controlled by Douds. For to prove its assertion that 9 (h) was preventive rather than retributive in purpose,\n32\n the Court in Douds focused \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 458]\n\u00a0\n on the fact that members of the Communist Party could escape from the class of persons specified by Congress simply by resigning from the Party:\n\n\"Here the intention is to forestall future dangerous acts; there is no one who may not, by a voluntary alteration of the loyalties which impel him to action, become eligible to sign the affidavit. We cannot conclude that this section is a bill of attainder.\" Id., at 414.\n\n\n Section 504, unlike 9 (h), disqualifies from the holding of union office not only present members of the Communist Party, but also anyone who has within the past five years been a member of the Party. However, even if we make the assumption that the five-year provision was inserted not out of desire to visit retribution but purely out of a belief that failure to include it would lead to pro forma resignations from the Party which would not decrease the threat of political strikes, it still clearly appears that 504 inflicts \"punishment\" within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause. It would be archaic to limit the definition of \"punishment\" to \"retribution.\" Punishment serves several purposes: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent - and preventive. One of the reasons society imprisons those convicted of crimes is to keep them from inflicting future harm, but that does not make imprisonment any the less punishment.\n\nHistorical considerations by no means compel restriction of the bill of attainder ban to instances of retribution. A number of English bills of attainder were enacted for preventive purposes - that is, the legislature made a judgment, undoubtedly based largely on past acts and associations (as 504 is)\n33\n that a given person or group was likely to cause trouble (usually, overthrow the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 459]\n\u00a0\n government) and therefore inflicted deprivations upon that person or group in order to keep it from bringing about the feared event.\n34\n It is also clear that many of the early American bills attainting the Tories were passed in order to impede their effectively resisting the Revolution.\n\n\"In the progress of the conflict, and particularly in its earliest periods, attainder and confiscation had been resorted to generally, throughout the continent, as a means of war. But it is a fact important to the history of the revolting colonies, that the acts prescribing penalties, usually offered to the persons against whom they were directed the option of avoiding them, by acknowledging their allegiance to the existing governments.\n\n\n \"It was a preventive, not a vindictive policy. In the same humane spirit, as the contest approached its close, and the necessity of these severities diminished, many of the states passed laws offering pardons \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 460]\n\u00a0\n to those who had been disfranchised, and restoring them to the enjoyment of their property . . . .\"\n35\n\u00a0\n\n\n Thus Justice Iredell was on solid historical ground when he observed, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399-400, that \"attainders, on the principle of retaliation and proscription, have marked all the vicissitudes of party triumph.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nWe think that the Court in Douds misread United States v. Lovett when it suggested, \n339 \nU.S., at 413\n, that that case could be distinguished on the ground that the sanction there imposed was levied for purely retributive reasons. In Lovett the Court, after reviewing the legislative history of 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, \n328 \nU.S., at 308\n-313, concluded that the statute was the product of a congressional drive to oust from government persons whose (congressionally determined) \"subversive\" tendencies made their continued employment dangerous to the national welfare: \"the purpose of all who sponsored 304 . . . clearly was to `purge' the then existing and all future lists of government employees of those whom Congress deemed guilty of `subversive activities' and therefore `unfit' to hold a federal job.\" Id., at 314. Similarly, the purpose of the statute before us is to purge the governing boards of labor unions of those whom Congress regards as guilty of subversive acts and associations and therefore unfit to fill positions which might affect interstate commerce.\n36\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 461]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Solicitor General urges us to distinguish Lovett on the ground that the statute struck down there \"singled out three identified individuals.\" It is of course true that 504 does not contain the words \"Archie Brown,\" and that it inflicts its deprivation upon more than three people. However, the decisions of this Court, as well as the historical background of the Bill of Attainder Clause, make it crystal clear that these are distinctions without a difference. It was not uncommon for English acts of attainder to inflict their deprivations upon relatively large groups of people,\n37\n sometimes by description rather than name.\n38\n Moreover, the statutes voided in Cummings and Garland were of this nature.\n39\n We cannot agree that the fact that 504 inflicts its deprivation upon the membership of the Communist Party rather than upon a list of named individuals takes it out of the category of bills of attainder.\n\nWe do not hold today that Congress cannot weed dangerous persons out of the labor movement, any more than the Court held in Lovett that subversives must be permitted to hold sensitive government positions. Rather, we make again the point made in Lovett: that Congress must accomplish such results by rules of general applicability. It cannot specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes is to be levied. Under our Constitution, Congress possesses full legislative authority, but the task of adjudication must be left to other tribunals. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 462]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis Court is always reluctant to declare that an Act of Congress violates the Constitution, but in this case we have no alternative. As Alexander Hamilton observed:\n\n\"By a limited constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\"\n40\n\u00a0\n\n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 73 Stat. 536, 29 U.S.C. 504 (1958 ed., Supp. IV). The section, which took effect on September 14, 1959, provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\"(a) No person who is or has been a member of the Communist Party . . . shall serve -\n\n\n\"(1) as an officer, director, trustee, member of any executive board or similar governing body, business agent, manager, organizer, or other \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n employee (other than as an employee performing exclusively clerical or custodial duties) of any labor organization . . . .\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"during or for five years after the termination of his membership in the Communist Party . . . .\n\n\n\"(b) Any person who willfully violates this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In American Communications Assn. v.

The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 445]\n\u00a0\n ought not to be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favour of personal security and private rights . . . . The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and with indignation, that sudden changes, and legislative interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators; and snares to the more industrious and less informed part of the community.\" The Federalist, No. 44, p. 351 (Hamilton ed. 1880).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, pp. 536-537 (8th ed. 1927).

L. Rev. 1, 7-12. Macaulay's account of the attainder of Sir John Fenwick is particularly vivid:\n\n\"Some hundreds of gentlemen, every one of whom had much more than half made up his mind before the case was open, performed the office both of judge and jury. They were not restrained, as a judge is restrained, by the sense of responsibility . . . . They were not selected, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 446]\n\u00a0\n as a jury is selected, in a manner which enables a culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies. The arbiters of the prisoner's fate came in and went out as they chose. They heard a fragment here and there of what was said against him, and a fragment here and there of what was said in his favor. During the progress of the bill they were exposed to every species of influence. One member might be threatened by the electors of his borough with the loss of his seat . . . . In the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to well-constituted tribunals, but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free.\" IX Macaulay, History of England, p. 207 (1900).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The same thought is reflected in the writings of Thomas Jefferson:\n\n\"173 despots would surely be as oppressive as one. . . . [L]ittle will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves. . . . [T]he government we fought for [is] one which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others. For this reason that convention, which passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time. . . . If . . . the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can it be effectual; because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have accordingly in many instances, decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy . . . .\" Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, pp. 157-158 (Ford ed. 1894). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] In 1872, in Pierce v. Carskadon, 16 Wall. 234, the Court voided as a bill of attainder a West Virginia statute conditioning access to the courts upon the taking of an oath similar to those involved in Cummings and Garland. In Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n, this Court upheld a West Virginia statute requiring that physicians obtain a license in order to practice. Appellant argued, inter alia, that the statute was a bill of attainder because the granting of a license was conditioned upon graduating from medical school, practicing for 10 years, or passing a special examination. The Court rejected the argument on the ground that the statute set forth general qualifications applicable to all persons who wanted to practice medicine, id., at 124, and did not single out a specific person or group for deprivation. See also Drehman v. Stifle, 8 Wall. 595.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Section 304 provided:\n\n\"No part of any appropriation, allocation, or fund (1) which is made available under or pursuant to this Act, or (2) which is now, or which \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 449]\n\u00a0\n is hereafter made, available under or pursuant to any other Act, to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, shall be used, after November 15, 1943, to pay any part of the salary, or other compensation for the personal services, of Goodwin B. Watson, William E. Dodd, Junior, and Robert Morss Lovett, unless prior to such date such person has been appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate: Provided, That this section shall not operate to deprive any such person of payment for leaves of absence or salary, or of any refund or reimbursement, which have accrued prior to November 15, 1943 . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Although it may be that underinclusiveness is a characteristic of most bills of attainder, we doubt that it is a necessary feature. We think it clear from the Lovett opinion that 304 would have been voided even if it could have been demonstrated that no one other than Lovett, Watson and Dodd possessed the characteristics which Congress was trying to reach. The vice of attainder is that the legislature has decided for itself that certain persons possess certain characteristics and are therefore deserving of sanction, not that it has failed to sanction others similarly situated.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] We of course take no position on whether or not members of the Communist Party are in fact likely to incite political strikes. The point we make is rather that the Constitution forbids Congress from making such determinations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] See \n367 \nU.S., at 146\n (BLACK, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] \"It need hardly be said that it is upon the particular evidence in a particular record that a particular defendant must be judged, and not upon the evidence in some other record or upon what may be supposed to be the tenets of the Communist Party.\" Noto v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 290, 299\n.\n\nIt is argued that 504 is not a bill of attainder because prior to its enactment there had been an administrative adjudication (by the Subversive Activities Control Board) of \"the nature of the Party.\" Compare Hawker v. New York, \n170 \nU.S. 189\n; DeVeau v. Braisted, \n363 \nU.S. 144, 160\n. Even leaving aside the fact that the legislative history of 504, see note 2, supra, indicates that Congress was acting in reliance on the findings it had made in 1947 rather than on those made by the Board in 1953, we think that this argument misses the point of the Court's opinion in the Communist Party case, where the Court stressed that the Subversive Activities Control Act did not name the Communist Party but rather set forth a broad definition, which would permit the Party to escape the prescribed deprivations in the event its character changed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] 48 Stat. 194, as amended, 49 Stat. 709, 12 U.S.C. 78 (1964 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] A similar example is furnished by provisions forbidding state officers or employees from concurrently holding certain other types of positions, such as positions with the Federal Government. See, e. g., Cal. Const., Art. IV, 20; cf. N. Y. Const., Art. III, 7; U.S. Const., Art I, 6, cl. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] The command of the Bill of Attainder Clause - that a legislature can provide that persons possessing certain characteristics must abstain from certain activities, but must leave to other tribunals the task of deciding who possesses those characteristics - does not mean that a legislature cannot use a shorthand phrase to summarize the characteristics with which it is concerned. For example, a legislature might determine that persons afflicted with a certain disease which has as one of its symptoms a susceptibility to uncontrollable seizures should not be licensed to operate dangerous machinery. In enacting a statute to achieve this goal, the legislature could name the disease instead of listing the symptoms, for in doing so it would merely be substituting a shorthand phrase which conveys the same meaning.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] To the same effect, see Noto v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 290, 299\n-300; Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183, 190\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] We rely on the \"overbroadness\" cases only to buttress our conclusion that 504 cannot be rationalized on the ground that membership in the Communist Party is merely an equivalent, shorthand way of expressing those characteristics which render likely the incitement of political strikes. We of course do not hold that overbroadness is a necessary characteristic of a bill of attainder.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] The Court's opinion in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1, 88\n, also referred to the fact that the members of the class affected by the statute could extricate themselves from the class at will. However, whereas the factor of escapability was considered in Douds to be probative of whether or not the statute was punitive, in the Communist Party case it was considered only as one factor tending to show that the Act in question was not directed at a specific group of persons but rather set forth a generally applicable definition. See note 26, supra. We do not read either opinion to have set up inescapability as an absolute prerequisite to a finding of attainder. Such an absolute rule would have flown in the face of explicit precedent, Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 324, as well as the historical background of the constitutional prohibition. A number of ante-Constitution bills of attainder inflicted their deprivations upon named or described persons or groups, but offered them the option of avoiding the deprivations, e. g., by swearing allegiance to the existing government. See, e. g., Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13; III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see generally Note, 72 Yale L. J. 330, 339-340.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 389\n; see note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] See Ex parte Law, 15 Fed. Cas. 3, 9-10 (No. 8126) (D.C. S. D. Ga. 1866). Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes:\n\n\"There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing. If the ousted adviser were left at liberty, he could readily turn his resentment into coercion or rebellion and make a magnificent comeback to the utter ruin of those who had driven him from his high place. Therefore, the usual object of Parliamentary proceedings against an important minister was to put him to death.\" Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 103-104 (1956).\n\n\n The preventive purpose of the \"Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason\" of 1700, 13 Will. 3, c. 3, is demonstrated by the parliamentary declaration that anyone corresponding with the Prince or his followers would be subject to prosecution for treason. See also Chafee, supra, pp. 109-113 (impeachment and attainder of the Earl of Strafford), 115-118 (bill against the Earl of Clarendon).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see, e. g., Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13 (\"An Act to Prevent the Return of Tories\"); cf. Md. Laws February 1777, c. 20 (\"An Act to punish certain crimes and misdemeanors, and to prevent the growth of toryism\"); see also II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, p. 211, n. 1 (4th ed. 1873); authorities cited note 15, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] Nor do the deprivations imposed by the two statutes differ in any meaningful way. Section 304 cut off the salary of the specified individuals, thereby effectively barring them from government service, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 461]\n\u00a0\n \n328 \nU.S., at 316\n; 504 provides that specified persons cannot serve as officers of, or engage in most kinds of employment with, labor unions. Compare Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 317, 320; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 374.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] E. g., 12 Car. 2, c. 30; 19 Geo. 2, c. 26; 11 Geo. 3, c. 55.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] Note 13, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] See also Ex parte Law, 15 Fed.

JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\n\"A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.\" Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 323. When an enactment is challenged as an attainder, the central inquiry must be whether the disability imposed by the act is \"punishment\" (i. e., is directed at an individual or a group of individuals) or is \"regulation\" (i. e., is directed at controlling future conduct). Flemming v. Nestor, \n363 \nU.S. 603\n, at 613-614; accord, Trop v. Dulles, \n356 \nU.S. 86, 95\n-96 (WARREN, C. J., announcing judgment). Whether a punitive purpose would be inferred has depended in past cases on a number of circumstances, including the nature of the disability, whether it was traditionally regarded as punishment, whether it is rationally connected to a permissible legislative objective, as well as the specificity of the legislature's \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 463]\n\u00a0\n designation of the persons to be affected. See generally Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, \n372 \nU.S. 144, 168\n-169.\n\n\n In this case, however, the Court discards this meticulous multifold analysis that has been deemed necessary in the past. Instead the Court places the burden of separating attainders from permissible regulation on an examination of the legislative findings implied by the nature of the class designated. The Bill of Attainder Clause, the Court says, was intended to implement the separation of powers by confining the legislature to rule-making and preventing legislative invasion of a function left exclusively to the courts - fact-finding connected with applications of a general rule to individuals or groups. Section 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is therefore a bill of attainder because in pursuit of its purpose of preventing political strikes, it has specified the persons - Communist Party members - who are to be disqualified from holding union office, rather than excluding all persons who might engage in the undesirable conduct. The vice in 504 is that it does not set forth a rule generally applicable to \"any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics (acts and characteristics which, in Congress' view, make them likely to initiate political strikes)\" but has instead designated \"the persons who possess the feared characteristics,\" members of the Communist Party. Ante, at 450.\n\nAt this point the Court implies that legislation is sufficiently general if it specifies a characteristic that makes it likely that individuals falling within the group designated will engage in conduct Congress may prohibit. But the Court then goes on to reject the argument that Communist Party membership is in itself a characteristic raising such a likelihood. The Court declares that \"[e]ven assuming that Congress had reason to conclude that some Communists would use union positions to bring about \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 464]\n\u00a0\n political strikes, `. . . it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shar[e] their evil purposes or participat[e] in their illegal conduct.'\" Ante, at 456. (Emphasis added.) This sudden shift in analysis - from likelihood to certainty - must mean that the Bill of Attainder Clause proscribes legislative action with respect to any group smaller than the total class possessing the characteristic upon which legislative power is premised whenever the legislation is based only on a finding about the average characteristics of the subgroup. The legislature may focus on a particular group or class only when the group designation is a \"shorthand phrase\" for the feared characteristic - i. e., when it is common knowledge that all, not just some, members of the group possess the feared characteristic and thus such legislative designation would require no legislative fact-finding about individuals.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIn the Court's view, therefore, 504 is too narrow in specifying the particular class; but it is also too broad in treating all members of the class alike. On both counts - underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness - 504 is invalid as a bill of attainder because Congress has engaged in forbidden fact-finding about individuals and groups and has thus strayed into the area reserved to the judiciary by the Constitution.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt is not difficult to find some of the cases and statutes which the necessary implications of the Court's approach will overrule or invalidate.\n\nAmerican Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n, which upheld the predecessor statute to 504 is obviously \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 465]\n\u00a0\n overruled. In that case the Court accepted the congressional findings about the Communist Party and about the propensity of Party members \"to subordinate legitimate trade union objectives to obstructive strikes when dictated by Party leaders, often in support of the policies of a foreign government.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 388\n. Moreover, Congress was permitted to infer from a person's \"political affiliations and beliefs\" that such a person would be likely to instigate political strikes. \n339 \nU.S., at 391\n-392. Like 504, the statute there under consideration did not cover all persons who might be likely to call political strikes. Nevertheless, legislative findings that some Communists would engage in illegal activities were sufficient to sustain the exercise of legislative power. The Bill of Attainder Clause now forbids Congress to do precisely what was validated in Douds.\n\nSimilarly invalidated are statutes denying positions of public importance to groups of persons identified by their business affiliations, commonly known as conflict-of-interest statutes. In the Douds case the Court found in such statutes support for its conclusion that Congress could rationally draw inferences about probable conduct on the basis of political affiliations and beliefs, which it considered comparable to business affiliations. The majority in the case now before us likewise recognizes the pertinency of such statutes and, in its discussion of Board of Governors v. Agnew, \n329 \nU.S. 441\n, strenuously - and unsuccessfully - attempts to distinguish them.\n\nThe statute involved in Agnew, 32 of the Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 194, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 78 (1964 ed.), forbade any partner or employee of a firm primarily engaged in underwriting securities from being a director of a national bank. The Court expressly recognized that the statute was directed to the \"probability or likelihood\" that a bank director who was also a partner or employee of an underwriting firm \"may use his influence in the bank \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 466]\n\u00a0\n to involve it or its customers in securities which his underwriting house has in its portfolio or has committed itself to take.\" \n329 \nU.S., at 447\n. (Emphasis added.) And, as we noted in Douds, \n339 \nU.S., at 392\n, \"[t]here was no showing, nor was one required, that all employees of underwriting firms would engage in such conduct.\" See also Agnew, \n329 \nU.S., at 449\n.\n\nIn terms of the Court's analysis of the Bill of Attainder Clause, no meaningful distinction may be drawn between 32 of the Banking Act and 504. Both sections disqualify a specifically described group, officers and employees of underwriting firms in the one case and members of the Communist Party in the other. Both sections may be said to be underinclusive: others besides underwriters may have business interests conflicting with the duties of a bank director and others than Communists may call political strikes. Equally, both sections may be deemed overinclusive: neither section finds that all members of the group affected would violate their obligations to the office from which they are disqualified; some members would and perhaps others would not. Both sections are based on a probability or likelihood that this would occur. Both sections leave to the courts the task of determining whether particular persons are members of the designated groups and occupy the specified positions.\n\nIn attempting to distinguish the two sections, the Court states that in enacting 32 of the Banking Act Congress made no judgment or condemnation of any specific group of persons. Instead, the Court reasons, \"Congress relied upon its general knowledge of human psychology, and concluded that the concurrent holding of the two designated positions would present a temptation to any man - not just certain men or members of a certain political party.\" Ante, at 454. But 32 disqualifies only partners and employees of underwriting firms, not other \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 467]\n\u00a0\n businessmen with conflicting interests. And 504 applies to any man who occupies the two positions of labor union leader and member of the Communist Party. If based upon \"its general knowledge of human psychology\" Congress may make findings about a group including members and employees of underwriting firms which disqualify such persons from a certain office, why may not Congress on a similar basis make such a finding about members of the Communist Party? \"Because of their business connections, carrying as they do certain loyalties, interests and disciplines,\" 32 disqualifies members and employees of underwriting firms as posing \"a continuing threat of participation in the harmful activities . . . .\" Douds, \n339 \nU.S., at 392\n. The same might be said about 504, as was said about its predecessor: \"Political affiliations of the kind here involved, no less than business affiliations, provide rational ground for the legislative judgment that those persons proscribed by 9 (h) would be subject to `tempting opportunities' to commit acts deemed harmful to the national economy. In this respect, 9 (h) is not unlike a host of other statutes which prohibit specified groups of persons from holding positions of power and public interest because, in the legislative judgment, they threaten to abuse the trust that is a necessary concomitant of the power of office.\" Id., at 392.\n\nConflict-of-interest statutes are an accepted type of legislation.\n2\n Indeed, our Constitution contains a conflict-of-interest \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 468]\n\u00a0\n provision in Art. I, 6, cl. 2, which prohibits any Congressman from simultaneously holding office under the United States. If the Court would save the conflict-of-interest statutes, which apparently it would, it is difficult to understand why 504 is stricken down as a bill of attainder.\n\nOther legislative enactments relevant here are those statutes disqualifying felons from occupying certain positions. The leading case is Hawker v. New York, \n170 \nU.S. 189\n, which upheld a provision prohibiting convicted felons from practicing medicine against a claim that, as applied to one convicted before its enactment, it was an ex post facto law. The Court noted that a legislature may establish qualifications for the practice of medicine, and character may be such a qualification. Conviction of a felony, the Court reasoned, may be evidence of character:\n\n \"It is not open to doubt that the commission of crime . . . has some relation to the question of character. It is not, as a rule, the good people who commit crime. When the legislature declares that whoever has violated the criminal laws of the State shall be deemed lacking in good moral character it is not laying down an arbitrary or fanciful rule - one having no relation to the subject-matter, but is only appealing to a well recognized fact of human experience . . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"It is no answer to say that this test of character is not in all cases absolutely certain, and that sometimes it works harshly. Doubtless, one who has violated the criminal law may thereafter reform and become in fact possessed of a good moral character. But the legislature has power in cases of this kind \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 469]\n\u00a0\n to make a rule of universal application, and no inquiry is permissible back of the rule to ascertain whether the fact of which the rule is made the absolute test does or does not exist.\" \n170 \nU.S., at 196\n-197.\n\n\n Accord, De Veau v. Braisted, \n363 \nU.S. 144, 159\n-160 (Frankfurter, J., announcing judgment) (bill of attainder and ex post facto challenges).\n\nLike 504, the legislation challenged in Hawker was both overinclusive and underinclusive. Felons were not the only persons who might possess character defects making them unsuitable practitioners of medicine; and, as the Court expressly noted, not all felons would lack good moral character. Nevertheless, the legislature was permitted to disqualify all members of the class, rather than being required to delegate to the courts the responsibility of determining the character of each individual based on all relevant facts, including the prior conviction. The legislative findings that sustained the legislation attacked in Hawker were simply that a substantial number of felons would be likely to abuse the practice of medicine because of their bad character. It is just such findings respecting the average propensities of a given class of persons to engage in particular conduct that the Court will not now permit under the Bill of Attainder Clause. Though the Court makes no attempt to distinguish the Hawker-type laws it apparently would save them, see Trop v. Dulles, \n356 \nU.S. 86, 96\n-97 (WARREN, C. J., announcing judgment), and with them the provision of the statute now before the Court which disqualifies felons from holding union office.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 470]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court apparently agrees that the Subversive Activities Control Act was not a bill of attainder with regard to the Communist Party because, as the Court pointed out in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1\n, the finding that the Party was a Communist-action organization was not made by the legislature but was made administratively, after a trial-type hearing and subject to judicial review. But this apparently does not settle whether the statute is a bill of attainder with respect to Party members; for under today's approach, a finding about the Party and about some of its members does not cure the vice of overinclusiveness. The Subversive Activities Control Act attaches certain disqualifications to each Party member following the administrative-judicial finding that the Party is a Communist-action organization. Among other things, each Party member is disqualified from holding union office, almost the same disqualification as is involved here. Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 5 (a) (1) (E), added by the Act of Aug. 24, 1954, 6, 68 Stat. 777, 50 U.S.C. 784 (a) (1) (E) (1958 ed.). I do not see how this and the other consequences attached to Party membership in that Act could survive examination under the principles announced today.\n\nOn the other hand, if the statutes involved in Hawker and Agnew are not bills of attainder, how can the Subversive Activities Control Act be an attainder with respect to members of the Communist Party? In the Communist Party case, the Board found that the \"[Party's] principal leaders and a substantial number of its members are subject to and recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union and its representatives. This evidences domination and control over [the Party] by the Soviet Union, and a purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement.\" Modified Report of the Board, December 18, 1956, in Record in that case, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 471]\n\u00a0\n p. 2538. That finding was expressly sustained by this Court. \n367 \nU.S. 1, 57\n. Certainly, if Hawker and Agnew are to be followed at all, these nonlegislative findings establish a sufficient probability or likelihood with regard to Party members - a sufficient temptation to Party members who are also union officers - to permit the legislature to disqualify Party members from union office as it did in the Subversive Activities Control Act.\n\nAnd if the disqualification of Party members in the Subversive Activities Control Act is not a bill of attainder, neither is 504. If it is 504's specific designation of the Communist Party and its members which concerns the Court - if the Court would have the same concern if the statute in Agnew had disqualified the members of a particular underwriting firm - it seems to me that at this point this vice is no vice at all; for the Congress has provided in another statute, the Subversive Activities Control Act, for an adjudication about Communist-action organizations, the nature of the Party has now been adjudicated and an adequate probability about the future conduct of its members established to justify the disqualification which Congress has imposed. Compare Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232, 244\n (absent findings respecting nature of Communist Party at time of bar applicant's membership, membership in Party 15 years prior to application provides no rational ground for disqualification).\n\nThis, of course, is not the path the Court follows. Section 504 is said to impose punishment on specific individuals because it has disqualified all Communist Party members without providing for a judicial determination as to each member that he will call a political strike. A likelihood of doing so based on membership is not enough. By the same token, a statute disqualifying Communists (or authorizing the Executive Branch to do so) from holding sensitive positions in the Government would be automatically \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 472]\n\u00a0\n infirm, as would a requirement that employees of the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency disclaim membership in the Communist Party, unless in each case it is proved by evidence other than membership in the Communist Party, the nature of which has already been adjudicated, that the individual would commit acts of disloyalty or subordinate his official undertakings to the interests of the Party.\n\nBut how does one prove that a person would be disloyal? The Communist Party's illegal purpose and its domination by a foreign power have already been adjudicated, both administratively and judicially. If this does not in itself provide a sufficient probability with respect to the individual who persists in remaining a member of the Party, or if a probability is in any event insufficient, what evidence with regard to the individual will be sufficient to disqualify him? If he must be apprehended in the act of calling one political strike or in one act of disloyalty before steps can be taken to exclude him from office, there is little or nothing left of the preventive or prophylactic function of 504 or of the statutes such as the Court had before it in Hawker and Agnew.\n\nExamples of statutes that will now be suspect because of the Court's opinion but were, until today, unanimously accepted as legitimate exercise of legislative power could easily be multiplied. Such a catalogue in itself would lead one to inquire whether the Court's reasoning does not contain some flaw that explains such perverse results.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nOne might well begin by challenging the Court's premise that the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended to provide a general dividing line between legislative and judicial functions and thereby to operate as the chief means of implementing the separation of powers. While it must be conceded that our system of government is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 473]\n\u00a0\n based on the separation of powers and that the prohibition on bills of attainder is a judicially enforceable restraint on legislative power and therefore constitutes one among the many mechanisms implementing the separation of powers, that conclusion is the most that can be gleaned from the authorities cited by the Court. Some, like the statement quoted from Chief Justice Marshall, Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136, reflect views concerning \"whether the nature of society and of government does not prescribe some limits to the legislative power,\" id., at 135, rather than an analysis of the bill-of-attainder provision. None assigns a pre-eminent position to that provision as compared with other restraints on the legislature.\n\nOn the other hand, there are substantial reasons for concluding that the Bill of Attainder Clause may not be regarded as enshrining any general rule distinguishing between the legislative and judicial functions. Congress may pass legislation affecting specific persons in the form of private bills. It may also punish persons who commit contempt before it. So too, one may note that if Art. I, 9, cl. 3, immortalizes some notion of the separation of powers at the federal level, then Art. I, 10, necessarily does the same for the States. But it has long been recognized by this Court that \"[w]hether the legislative, executive and judicial powers of a State shall be kept altogether distinct and separate, or whether persons or collections of persons belonging to one department may, in respect to some matters, exert powers which, strictly speaking, pertain to another department of government, is for the determination of the State.\" Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 84\n; accord, e. g., Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 507\n; Carfer v. Caldwell, \n200 \nU.S. 293, 297\n; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234, 255\n (WARREN, C. J., announcing judgment), 256-257 (Frankfurter, J., concurring), 268 (CLARK, J., dissenting). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 474]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe basic flaw in the Court's reasoning, however, is its too narrow view of the legislative process. The Court is concerned to separate the legislative and judicial functions by ensuring that the legislature does not infringe the judicial function of applying general rules to specific circumstances. Congress is held to have violated the Bill of Attainder Clause here because, on the one hand, 504 does not encompass the whole class of persons having characteristics that would make them likely to call political strikes and, on the other hand, 504 does single out a particular group, members of the Communist Party, not all of whom possess such characteristics. Because of this combination of underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness the Court concludes that Communist Party members were singled out for punishment, thus rejecting the Government's contention that 504 has solely a regulatory aim.\n\nThe Court's conclusion that a statute which is both underinclusive and overinclusive must be deemed to have been adopted with a punitive purpose assumes that legislatures normally deal with broad categories and attack all of an evil at a time. Or if partial measures are undertaken, a legislature singles out a particular group for regulation only because the group label is a \"shorthand phrase\" for traits that are characteristic of the broader evil. But this Court has long recognized in equal protection cases that a legislature may prefer to deal with only part of an evil. See, e. g., Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, \n336 \nU.S. 106\n; Semler v. Oregon State Board of Dental Examiners, \n294 \nU.S. 608\n; Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63\n; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n. And it is equally true that a group may be singled out for regulation without any punitive purpose even when not all members of the group would be likely to engage in the feared conduct. \"[I]f the class discriminated \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 475]\n\u00a0\n against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly is to be feared, it properly may be picked out.\" Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S., at 144\n. (Emphasis added.) That is, the focus of legislative attention may be the substantially greater likelihood that some members of the group would engage in the feared conduct compared to the likelihood that members of other groups would do so. This is true because legislators seldom deal with abstractions but with concrete situations and the regulation of specific abuses. Thus many regulatory measures are enacted after investigation into particular incidents or the practices of particular groups and after findings by the legislature that the practices disclosed are inimical to the public interest and should be prevented in the future. Not surprisingly, the resulting legislation may reflect in its specificity the specificity of the preceding legislative inquiry. See United States v. Boston & M. R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 157, 161\n-162. But the fact that it does should not be taken, in itself, to be conclusive that the legislature's purpose is punitive. Admittedly the degree of specificity is a relevant factor - as when individuals are singled out by name - but because in many instances specificity of the degree here held impermissible may be wholly consistent with a regulatory, rather than a punitive purpose, the Court's per se approach cuts too broadly and invalidates legitimate legislative activity.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nPutting aside the Court's per se approach based on the nature of the classification specified by the legislation, we must still test 504 against the traditional definition of the bill of attainder as legislative punishment of particular individuals. In my view, 504 does not impose punishment and is not a bill of attainder. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 476]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have said that \"only the clearest proof could suffice\" to establish that Congress' purpose was punitive rather than regulatory. Flemming v. Nestor, \n363 \nU.S. 603, 617\n. A punitive purpose has been found when it could be said that a statute passed amid the fierce passions aroused by the Civil War bore no rational connection to any permissible legislative purpose. Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 319, 322; see Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114, 128\n; Hawker v. New York, \n170 \nU.S. 189, 198\n. The imposition of a particularly harsh deprivation without any discernible legitimate legislative purpose has similarly been characterized as penal. Trop v. Dulles, \n356 \nU.S. 86\n (WARREN, C. J., announcing judgment). Similarly a punitive purpose has been found when such a purpose clearly appeared in the legislative history. Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, \n372 \nU.S. 144, 169\n; United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303, 308\n-314. In other cases the analysis is more difficult. We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra:\n\n\"Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment - retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.\" \n372 \nU.S., at 168\n-169.\n\n\n An application of these criteria to 504 compels the conclusion that it is regulatory rather than punitive.\n\nCongress' concern with the possibility of political strikes is not simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a punitive \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 477]\n\u00a0\n purpose. Congress has sought to forestall political strikes since 1947, when it adopted 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, which was sustained as a reasonable regulation in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n. Section 504 was adopted as a fairer and more effective method of dealing with the same evil. H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), p. 33; 1 Leg. Hist. LMRDA 791. Section 9 (h) had proved ineffective because many Communists would take the prescribed oath, which meant the only sanction available was a perjury prosecution that presented serious difficulties of proof. See Hearings before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Communist Infiltration of Vital Industries and Current Communist Techniques in the Chicago, Illinois, Area, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 519, 576; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Communist Domination of Unions and National Security, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. (1952), p. 54. Moreover, the oath requirement created inequities both because the disqualification imposed was visited on the whole union membership and because the taking of an oath was exacted of all union leaders, many of whom resented the requirement. See American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S., at 434\n-435 (Jackson, J., concurring and dissenting); S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 7, 9; 1 Leg. Hist. LMRDA 403, 405. It was obviously reasonable for Congress to substitute 504 for 9 (h), and no punitive purpose may be inferred from such congressional action.\n\nNor can it be denied that 504 is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. In American Communications Assn. v. Douds, we held that \"Congress could rationally find that the Communist Party is not like other political parties in its utilization of positions of union leadership as means by which to bring about strikes . . .,\" \n339 \nU.S., at 391\n, and therefore Congress could rationally \n\n[381 \nU.S. 437, 478]\n\u00a0\n infer that members of the Communist Party were likely to call political strikes. See also Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n367 \nU.S. 1, 93\n-94, 112. In 1956 the Subversive Activities Control Board found, after a trial-type hearing, that the Party's principal leaders and a substantial number of its members recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union. Without question the findings previously made by Congress and the Subversive Activities Control Board afforded a rational basis in 1959 for Congress to conclude that Communists were likely to call political strikes, and sufficiently more likely than others to do so that special measures could appropriately be enacted to deal with the particular threat posed.\n\nIn view of Congress' demonstrated concern in preventing future conduct - political strikes - and the reasonableness of the means adopted to that end, I cannot conclude that 504 had a punitive purpose or that it constitutes a bill of attainder. I intimate no opinion on the issues that the Court does not reach.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An overbroadness challenge could also be made under the First Amendment on the ground that in 504 Congress has too broadly and indiscriminately visited disabilities on a class defined in terms of associational ties. See Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n. But the Court expressly disavows decision of First Amendment claims, and I likewise put such questions aside.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., 10 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 734, 15 U.S.C. 20 (1964 ed.) (requiring competitive bidding for certain transactions between a common carrier and other corporations when there are common directors), United States v. Boston & M. R. Co., \n380 \nU.S. 157\n; 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 896, 15 U.S.C. 78p (b) (1964 ed.)

Braisted, \n363 \nU.S. 144, 159\n (Frankfurter, J., announcing judgment). De Veau v.

CALIFORNIA(1965)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1965\n\n\n\n\n\n The United States brought this suit in 1945 against California to determine dominion over the submerged lands and mineral rights under the three-mile belt of sea off the California coast. In 1947 this Court held (\n332 \nU.S. 19\n) that the United States possessed paramount rights in such lands and minerals underlying the Pacific Ocean seaward of the low-water mark on the California coast and outside of inland waters. Thereafter the Court appointed a Special Master to determine for specific coastal segments the line of ordinary low water and the outer limit of inland waters. In his Report, filed in 1952, the Master based his definition of inland waters on that applied by the United States in its foreign relations as of the date of the 1947 decree. Both parties noted exceptions to the Report, but before any further action, the Submerged Lands Act was enacted in 1953. This Act gave the States ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within their boundaries, including the seaward boundaries \"as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union,\" but in no event to be interpreted as extending from the \"coast line\" more than three geographical miles into the Pacific Ocean. \"Coast line\" was derivatively defined in terms of the seaward limit of \"inland waters,\" a term not defined by the Act. No action was taken on the Master's Report until 1963, when the United States filed an amended complaint reviving the Report and redescribing the issues as modified by the Submerged Lands Act. The United States contends that the Act simply moved the line out three miles from the line established by the 1947 decree, while California asserts that \"inland waters\" as used in the Act means not what the United States would claim as such in international relations but what the States historically considered to be inland when they joined the Union. Held:\n\n 1. The Act's legislative history shows that \"inland waters\" was to be defined by the courts. Pp. 150-160. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (a) By eliminating the definition of inland waters from the bill Congress intended to leave the meaning of the term to the courts, independently of the Act. Pp. 150-154.\n\n\n (b) The addition of the three-mile limitation provision to the bill shows that Congress must have intended that some criterion be used by the courts other than one dependent upon a State's subjective concept of its inland waters. Pp. 154-160.\n\n\n 2. The definition of inland waters, as used in the Act, should conform to the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. Pp. 161-167.\n\n\n (a) While this Court did not define inland waters in the 1947 opinion in this case, it did indicate that it was to have an international content since the outer limits of such waters would determine our international coastline. Pp. 161-162.\n\n\n (b) Subsequent to the Special Master's Report, this country ratified the Convention, which is now in force and represents the position of the United States. Pp. 163-164.\n\n\n (c) The Act does not restrict the Court to the time of enactment in determining the best and most workable definition of inland waters, which is found in the Convention. Pp. 164-165.\n\n\n (d) Adopting the meaning of inland waters in terms of the Convention definition, with a 24-mile maximum closing line for bays and a \"semicircle\" test for the sufficiency of the water area enclosed, will provide definiteness and stability to the rights granted in the Act. Pp. 165-167.\n\n\n 3. Although the Convention permits the use of the straight-base-line method for ascertaining inland waters claimed against other nations, the choice is one that rests with the United States, which is responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs, and not with the individual States. Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240\n, distinguished. Pp. 167-169.\n\n\n 4. Applying the Convention's 24-mile closing rule and the \"semicircle\" test for classifying bays, Monterey Bay is inland water, but none of the other coastal segments in dispute meets the requirements. Pp. 169-170.\n\n\n 5. California's assertion that Santa Barbara Channel may be considered a \"fictitious bay\" under international law cannot force the United States, which disagrees, to take such a position to extend our international boundaries. Pp. 170-172. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 6. The exception to the Convention's 24-mile closing rule for \"historic\" bays, those over which a nation has traditionally asserted and maintained dominion, cannot benefit California unless the United States endorses its claims or there is clear historic evidence supporting such claims. None of the disputed water areas (not considering Monterey Bay which is covered by the 24-mile rule) is an historic inland water of the United States. Pp. 172-175.\n\n\n 7. Open roadsteads used for loading, unloading and anchoring ships are, pursuant to the Convention, areas of the territorial sea and are therefore not to be considered inland waters. P. 175.\n\n\n 8. The average of the lower of the two daily low tides should be used in determining the Act's \"line of ordinary low water,\" recognized by the Convention. Pp. 175-176.\n\n\n 9. The sovereignty of the States extends to new land obtained by artificial accretion as well as natural modification of the shoreline. Pp. 176-177.\n\n\n\n Special Master's Report approved as modified.\n\n\nSolicitor General Cox argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Stephen J. Pollak, George S. Swarth and Martin Green.\n\n\nRichard H. Keatinge, Special Assistant Attorney General of California, argued the cause for defendant. With him on the briefs were Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General, Stanley Mosk, former Attorney General, Charles E. Corker, Howard S. Goldin and Jay L. Shavelson, Assistant Attorneys General, and Warren J. Abbott and N. Gregory Taylor, Deputy Attorneys General.\n\n\nGeorge N. Hayes, Special Assistant Attorney General of Alaska, by special leave of Court, argued the cause for the State of Alaska, as amicus curiae. With him on the brief were Warren C. Colver, Attorney General, and Avrum M. Gross, Special Assistant Attorney General.\n\n\nJohn B. Ogden filed briefs for Carl Whitson, as amicus curiae. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nThe present case requires us to determine the extent of submerged lands granted to the State of California by the Submerged Lands Act of 1953,\n1\n and in particular to declare whether specified bodies of water on the California coast are \"inland waters\" within the meaning of that Act. A substantial amount of background is necessary to place the issues in perspective.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n   THE SETTING OF THE CASE.\n\n\n\n This is a suit begun in 1945, brought by the United States against California to determine dominion over the submerged lands and mineral rights under the three-mile belt of sea off the coast of California. In 1947 the Court decreed:\n\n \"The United States of America is now, and has been at all times pertinent hereto, possessed of paramount rights in, and full dominion and power over, the lands, minerals and other things underlying the Pacific Ocean lying seaward of the ordinary low-water mark on the coast of California, and outside of the inland waters, extending seaward three nautical miles . . . . The State of California has no title thereto or property interest therein.\" United States v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 804, 805\n, Order and Decree.\n\n\n\n After the entry of this decree, the United States asked that the lands awarded to it be defined in greater detail in certain areas where there was substantial oil well activity, and which California asserted lay within inland waters. The Court appointed a Special Master,\n2\n and directed him to consider seven specified segments of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n California coast\n3\n to determine the line of ordinary low water and the outer limit of inland waters. These segments included various bays, and, as the problem evolved, the so-called \"overall unit area\" consisting of the waters inside a line encompassing the islands off the shore of southern California, some as far as 50 miles out.\n4\n The Special Master's Report, generally favoring the position of the United States, was filed with this Court in November 1952, \n344 \nU.S. 872\n. He adopted as his criteria for defining inland waters those applied by the United States \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 144]\n\u00a0\n in the conduct of its foreign affairs as of the date of the California decree, October 27, 1947 - in particular, a rule that only a bay having a closing line across its mouth no more than 10 miles in length and enclosing a sufficient water area to satisfy the so-called Boggs formula\n5\n would be inland water, with the qualification that a bay which had been historically considered inland water would so continue.\n6\n Both parties noted their exceptions to the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n Report, but before any further action was taken, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act.\n\n\nThe Submerged Lands Act\n7\n grants to the States \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n within the boundaries of the respective States.\" 3 (a). \"Boundaries\" includes the seaward boundaries of a State \"as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union, or as heretofore approved by the Congress,\" but subject to the limitation that\n\n\"in no event shall the term `boundaries' . . . be interpreted as extending from the coast line more than three geographical miles into the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, or more than three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.\" 2 (b). \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 147]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Coast line\" is then defined as the composite \"line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.\" 2 (c). For States \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 148]\n\u00a0\n having no previously approved seaward boundaries the Act provides that \"[a]ny State admitted subsequent to the formation of the Union which has not already done so may extend its seaward boundaries to a line three geographical miles distant from its coast line . . . .\" 4.\n\n\n\n Thus the Act effectively grants each State on the Pacific coast all submerged lands shoreward of a line three geographical miles\n8\n from its \"coast line,\" derivatively defined in terms of \"the seaward limit of inland waters.\" \"Inland waters\" is not defined by the Act.\n\n\nIn a later measure related to the Submerged Lands Act, Congress declared that the United States owned all submerged land in the continental shelf seaward of the lands granted to the States. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 67 Stat. 462, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.\n\n\nThe passage of the Submerged Lands Act marked the beginning of a long halt in the proceedings in this case. Depth of California's coastal waters increases very rapidly, and as of May 22, 1953, the date of enactment, it was impractical to drill for oil except close to the shore. By granting to California the mineral rights in the three-mile belt, the Act vested in California all the interests that were then thought to be important, and no further action was taken on the Special Master's Report. That Report was neither adopted, modified, nor rejected \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 149]\n\u00a0\n by this Court, but was simply allowed to lie dormant. By 1963, however, drilling techniques had improved sufficiently to revitalize the importance of the demarcation line between state and federal submerged lands. The United States filed an amended complaint reviving the Special Master's Report and redescribing the issues as modified by the Submerged Lands Act; both the United States and California filed new exceptions to the Report, and the case is now ready for decision.\n\n\nThe basic contention of the United States is that the Act simply moved the line of demarcation out three miles from the line established by the California decree. Therefore, contends the United States, the Special Master's Report on the line of ordinary low water and the outer limit of inland waters as used in the California decree is just as relevant now as it was before Congress acted, and, with slight modifications, the line drawn by the Special Master should be taken as the \"coast line\" for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. California asserts that whereas the Special Master determined inland waters to be those which the United States would have claimed as such for purposes of international relations, the Submerged Lands Act used the term in an entirely different sense to mean those waters which the States historically considered to be inland - in California's case, those waters which the State considered to be inland at the time it entered the Union. Therefore, according to California, the line drawn in the Special Master's Report was determined under standards wholly foreign to the Submerged Lands Act.\n\n\nThe focal point of this case is the interpretation to be placed on \"inland waters\" as used in the Act. Since the Act does not define the term, we look to the legislative history. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 150]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n LEGISLATIVE HISTORY REVEALS THAT CONGRESS MEANT  TO LEAVE THE DEFINITION OF INLAND WATERS    TO THE COURTS.\n\n\n\n Two changes relevant for our purposes were made in the bill which became the Submerged Lands Act between the time it was sent to the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the time of its passage.\n\n\n(1) As first written, the bill defined inland waters to include\n\n\"all estuaries, ports, harbors, bays, channels, straits, historic bays, and sounds, and all other bodies of water which join the open sea.\"\n\n\n\n This definition was removed by the Senate Committee.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n  (2) The bill originally contained no limitation on the extent of historic boundaries that could be claimed. The provision limiting the extent of boundary claims to no more than three geographical miles from the coastline on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues on the Gulf of Mexico was added to the bill on the floor of the Senate in the late stages of the debates.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\nRemoval of the definition for inland waters and the addition of the three-mile limitation in the Pacific, when taken together, unmistakably show that California cannot prevail in its contention that \"as used in the Act, Congress intended inland waters to identify those areas which the states always thought were inland waters.\"\n11\n By deleting the original definition of \"inland waters\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 151]\n\u00a0\n Congress made plain its intent to leave the meaning of the term to be elaborated by the courts, independently of the Submerged Lands Act.\n\n\nIn response to substantial objections made in the hearings to the original bill's broad definition of inland waters on grounds that it would prejudice and limit the position which the United States could take in its future conduct of foreign affairs,\n12\n Senator Cordon, the manager of the bill, recommended and obtained elimination of the definition. The Committee Report which he authored explained:\n\n \"The words `which include all estuaries, ports. harbors, bays, channels, straits, historic bays, and sounds, and all other bodies of water which join the open sea' have been deleted from the reported bill because of the committee's belief that the question of what constitutes inland waters should be left where Congress finds it. The committee is convinced that the definition neither adds nor takes away anything a State may have now in the way of a coast and the lands underneath waters behind it.\" S. Rep. No. 133, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 18.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The committee's understanding that the measure \"neither adds nor takes away anything a State may have now in the way of a coast and the lands underneath waters behind it,\" appears to be an acceptance of \"inland waters\" as used in the California and prior Court opinions, whatever that usage might have been. Various different concepts of inland waters were asserted during the Senate Hearings, based on such elements as the depth of the water,\n14\n the width of the opening of a coastal indentation,\n15\n the Boggs formula, and the common designation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 152]\n\u00a0\n of bodies of water as bays, sounds, straits, etc.\n16\n When it became clear that the question had highly technical aspects (see, e. g., n. 5, supra) and was one on which differences would arise, the Senate Committee adopted the expedient solution of leaving the matter just as it had found it, neither accepting nor rejecting any particular rule or formula.\n17\n It intended to leave unaffected the judicial view of inland waters and the judicial responsibility for particularizing it.\n\n\nReference to Senator Cordon's request to the Senate Committee for deletion of the objectionable clause confirms that understanding. He said:\n\n\"The matter of inland waters is one that has been defined time and time again by the courts, not, I believe, in any one all-inclusive definition, but it was felt [by those who objected to the definition during the hearings] that the use of these words were [sic] an attempted legislative definition of the term `inland waters,' and it was inadvisable for us in this bill, which is a transfer of title, to attempt to make law in the other field of what is or is not inland water.\n\n\n \"The use of the language, it was felt, would probably raise questions that have not been raised, whereas the present definitions are in the decisions and available to the court.\"\n\n\n \"Senator MALONE. The inland waters had a special master for that particular job, did they not, and that is now under consideration, that is, his report is under consideration by the Supreme Court?\n\n\n \"Senator CORDON. With respect to California, and a portion of California coast; yes.\" Senate Hearings 1304-1305. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 153]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n Shortly thereafter there follows a virtually conclusive statement:\n\n \"Senator CORDON. It was not the chairman's view that we were attempting to draw a line delimiting inland waters, but that we were using a term that is well known in the law and is defined by the Court in the California case, for instance, and in the Louisiana case, I assume. That line might still be defined, even though the area may not now have the same legal status as it had before.\"\n18\n Id., at 1376. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n California fastens on a statement made in the Committee Report with regard to the eliminated definition:\n\n\"The elimination of the language, in the committee's opinion, is consistent with the philosophy of the Holland bill to place the States in the position in which both they and the Federal Government thought they were for more than a century and a half, and not to create any situations with respect thereto.\" S. Rep. No. 133, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 18.\n\n\n\n From this California reasons that \"inland waters\" must have been intended to encompass all waters which the States \"thought\" were inland waters, for that is the only way in which the Act can now be interpreted to effectuate fully its supposed \"philosophy\" of granting to the States all submerged lands within their historic boundaries.\n\n\nIf such a view of the bill's purpose is accepted as of the time that the Committee Report was written, there is, nonetheless, no inconsistency whatsoever between that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 154]\n\u00a0\n purpose and a legislative intent to leave the definition of inland waters to the courts without restriction; at that time the limitation on boundary claims had not yet been incorporated into the Act; thus as the Act was then written, States could have claimed all submerged lands within their historic boundaries, no matter how \"inland waters\" was defined. The definition would have affected only those States which, not having adequate pre-existing seaward boundaries, chose to extend their boundaries three miles from the coastline pursuant to 4 of the Act. As stated by Senator Cordon during the Hearings.\n\n\"this bill has two approaches to a determination of the area of its application. The first approach is that of the boundaries of the States when they came into the Union; second, an election to any State that has not done so to extend its boundary 3 geographical miles from its present coastline, as that term is described in the present tense in the bill.\" Senate Hearings 1374.\n\n\n\n Only with the adoption of the three-mile limitation on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the three-league limitation in the Gulf of Mexico did the interpretations of historic boundaries and inland waters become operationally related, and any inconsistency thus created between the limitation and the prior philosophy of the Act shows only that, to the extent the limitation would come into play, the philosophy was modified.\n19\n This amendment was one of very few made to the bill as reported by the Senate Committee, and came as the result of continuous criticism throughout the course of the debates that the extent of the grant was indefinite,\n20\n and that coastal States could engage in a \"claiming race\"\n21\n for submerged lands. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 155]\n\u00a0\n California points to language stating that adoption of the limitation worked no significant change in the bill. 99 Cong. Rec. 4114-4116 (remarks of Senator Holland). But such statements simply reflect the understanding of the major supporters of the bill that no States other than Texas and Florida (on its Gulf side) had provable claims beyond three miles, and that the claims of those two States did not go beyond three leagues.\n22\n If such were the case, the limitation could indeed be thought to have no effect, for no state boundaries would run afoul of it. and the vast grant of submerged lands up to three miles along the length of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and three leagues, subject to historical proof, in the Gulf of Mexico, would not be impaired. Senator Holland, the author of the bill, proposed the limiting boundary amendment to meet the fears of those Senators who had criticized the indefiniteness of the bill. He explained:\n\n  \". . . I think the amendment has very little effect. But I am perfectly willing to meet the suggestions of my friends, some of whom have been opponents, and some of whom have been supporters of the joint resolution, to the effect that they would like to have the language more clearly spelled out than it was in the original measure, to the effect that there is no intention whatsoever to grant boundaries beyond 3 geographical miles in either the Atlantic or the Pacific, and that this Congress knows of no possible situation under which greater boundaries are claimed or could be granted in the Gulf of Mexico than 3 leagues; and, in that case, this Congress knows, although this amendment does not indicate it, that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 156]\n\u00a0\n there are but 2 States affected by that particular situation.\" 99 Cong. Rec. 4116.\n\n\n\n Senator Holland was aware of California's expansive inland water claims, but thought them altogether untenable.\n\n \"Mr. HOLLAND. My understanding is that California has no provable case beyond 3 miles from its mainland; and that as to the islands, its provable case would be 3 miles around each of the islands. I so stated in the hearings on this matter.\n\n\n \"Mr. DOUGLAS. That is a consummation devoutly to be desired, but I am not at all satisfied that that is what the Senator's joint resolution would accomplish, because the coastline is not fully and clearly defined.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. HOLLAND. Under the joint resolution, no such contention could be maintained.\n\n\n \"Mr. DOUGLAS. Is the Senator certain of that?\n\n\n \"Mr. HOLLAND. That is what I believe, and that is what every legal authority I have consulted on the subject believes. Incidentally, the only reason why there was some thought to the contrary was some wording in the original joint resolution, which has been omitted, which would have made the outer boundary of inland waters farther out than that which is now provided by the joint resolution. The joint resolution simply continues the outer boundary of inland waters pursuant to the decisions of the Supreme Court already made. . . .\n\n\n . .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"The Senator from Florida knows full well that if the United States Supreme Court should change its mind as to what constituted the outer limits of inland waters, and should change it to a sufficient degree, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 157]\n\u00a0\n it could open up, not only under this joint resolution, but of its own initiative, questions which would reach out much farther than anything we have been talking about here.\n\n\n \"The Senator from Florida believes that the laws, as announced over and over and over again by the Supreme Court, as to the delimitation of inland waters, are sufficiently fixed, definite, and certain so that it would require a complete, cataclysmic change of the Supreme Court's philosophy in that field to afford any hope for an extension of the boundaries of the good State of California so that they would go out beyond the islands as to all areas contained within an outer line. There is no way for us to foreclose the Supreme Court from changing its mind. It might change its mind with reference to inland waters and their delimitation. But failing such change, the Senator from Florida cannot see how, under this joint resolution, there could possibly be any serious question affecting California or any other State.\" 99 Cong. Rec. 2756-2757.\n\n\n\n Senator Holland did not wish to foreclose California from arguing (as it has done both here and before the Special Master) that its waters are inland within the appropriate judicial definition, but it was his opinion that no such definition would permit California's claim to all waters shoreward of their remote islands to prevail. Congress could have defined inland waters as it wished for the purely domestic purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. See United States v. Louisiana, \n363 \nU.S. 1, 30\n-36. It could have adopted California's theory, or the Special Master's theory, or any other. Instead, it chose to leave the definition of inland waters where it found it - in the Court's hands. The Act does not reveal a particular intent that courts should broadly interpret \"inland waters\" so as to restore California to its historic expectations regardless \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 158]\n\u00a0\n of what its expectations might be.\n23\n Indeed, if the Court is to draw any inference from the intent and structure of the Act as to how inland waters should be \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 159]\n\u00a0\n defined, the most plausible inference would be that Congress, in adopting the three-mile limitation, must have intended some base line to be used other than one dependent \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 160]\n\u00a0\n upon each State's subjective concept of its inland waters, for such a limitation would prove to have been none at all, as full acceptance of California's claims in the present case would show. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 161]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n THE MEANING OF \"INLAND WATERS\" IN THE SUBMERGED   LANDS ACT SHOULD CONFORM TO THE CONVENTION   ON THE TERRITORIAL SEA AND THE   CONTIGUOUS ZONE.\n\n\n\n We turn, then, to determining the judicial definition of \"inland waters.\" It immediately appears that the bulk of cases cited by Congressmen during debates on the Submerged Lands Act for the proposition that inland waters have \"been defined time and time again by the courts\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 162]\n\u00a0\n deal with interior waters such as lakes and rivers, and provide no assistance in classifying bodies of water which join the open sea.\n24\n In this latter context no prior case in this Court has ever precisely defined the term. The 1947 California opinion clearly indicated that \"inland waters\" was to have an international content since the outer limits of inland waters would determine the Country's international coastline, but the Court did not particularize the definition.\n25\n It was that task which subsequently led to the appointment of the Special Master. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 163]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Special Master found that there was no internationally accepted definition for inland waters and decided, in those circumstances, that it was the position which the United States took on the question in the conduct of its foreign affairs which should be controlling. He considered the relevant date on which to determine our foreign policy position to be the date of the California decree, October 27, 1947. He therefore rejected the assertion that letters from the State Department written in 1951 and 1952\n26\n declaring the then present policy of the United States were conclusive on the question before him. At the same time that decision required the Special Master to consider a great many foreign policy materials dating back to 1793 in an attempt to discern a consistent thread of United States policy on the definition of inland waters. He ultimately decided that as of 1947 the United States had taken the position that a bay was inland water only if a closing line could be drawn across its mouth less than 10 miles long enclosing a sufficient water area to satisfy the Boggs formula.\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince the filing of the Special Master's Report the policy of the United States has changed significantly. Indeed it may now be said that there is a settled international rule defining inland waters. On March 24, 1961, the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 164]\n\u00a0\n United States ratified the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone (T. I. A. S. No. 5639) and on September 10, 1964, when the requisite number of nations had ratified it, the Convention went into force. For nations which do not use a straight-base-line method\n28\n to define inland waters (see United Kingdom v. Norway, 1951. I. C. J. Rep. 116), the Convention permits a 24-mile maximum closing line for bays and a \"semicircle\" test for testing the sufficiency of the water area enclosed. The semicircle test requires that a bay must comprise at least as much water area within its closing line as would be contained in a semicircle with a diameter equal to the length of the closing line. Unquestionably the 24-mile closing line together with the semicircle test now represents the position of the United States.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States contends that we must ignore the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone in performing our duty of giving content to \"inland waters\" as used in the Submerged Lands Act, and must restrict ourselves to determining what our decision would have been had the question been presented to us for decision on May 22, 1953, the date of enactment. At that time there was no international accord on any definition of inland waters, and the best evidence (although strenuously contested by California) of the position of the United States was the letters of the State Department which the Special Master refused to treat as conclusive.\n\n\nWe do not think that the Submerged Lands Act has so restricted us. Congress, in passing the Act, left the responsibility for defining inland waters to this Court.\n30\n We think that it did not tie our hands at the same time. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 165]\n\u00a0\n Had Congress wished us simply to rubber-stamp the statements of the State Department as to its policy in 1953, it could readily have done so itself.\n31\n It is our opinion that we best fill our responsibility of giving content to the words which Congress employed by adopting the best and most workable definitions available. The Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, approved by the Senate and ratified by the President,\n32\n provides such definitions. We adopt them for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act. This establishes a single coastline for both the administration of the Submerged Lands Act and the conduct of our future international relations (barring an unexpected change in the rules established by the Convention). Furthermore the comprehensiveness of the Convention provides answers to many of the lesser problems related to coastlines which, absent the Convention, would be most troublesome.\n33\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCalifornia argues, alternatively to its claim that \"inland waters\" embraces all ocean areas lying within a State's historic seaward boundaries, that if Congress intended \"inland waters\" to be judicially defined in accordance with international usage, such definition should possess an ambulatory quality so as to encompass future changes in international law or practice. Thus, if 10 years from now the definitions of the Convention were amended, California would say that the extent of the Submerged Lands Act grant would automatically shift, at least if the effect of such amendment were to enlarge the extent of submerged lands available to the States. We reject this open-ended view of the Act for several reasons. Before today's decision no one could say with assurance where lay the line of inland waters as contemplated by the Act; hence there could have been no tenable reliance on any particular line. After today that situation will have changed. Expectations will be established and reliance placed on the line we define. Allowing future shifts of international understanding respecting inland waters to alter the extent of the Submerged Lands Act grant would substantially undercut the definiteness of expectation which should attend it. Moreover, such a view might unduly inhibit the United States in the conduct of its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 167]\n\u00a0\n foreign relations by making its ownership of submerged lands vis-a-vis the States continually dependent upon the position it takes with foreign nations. \"Freezing\" the meaning of \"inland waters\" in terms of the Convention definition largely avoids this, and also serves to fulfill the requirements of definiteness and stability which should attend any congressional grant of property rights belonging to the United States.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n   SUBSIDIARY ISSUES.\n\n\n\n Once it is decided that the definitions of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone apply, many of the subsidiary issues before us fall into place.\n\n\n1. Straight Base Lines. - California argues that because the Convention permits a nation to use the straight-base-line method for determining its seaward boundaries if its \"coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity.\" California is therefore free to use such boundary lines across the openings of its bays and around its islands.\n34\n We agree with the United States that the Convention recognizes \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 168]\n\u00a0\n the validity of straight base lines used by other countries, Norway for instance, and would permit the United States to use such base lines if it chose, but that California may not use such base lines to extend our international boundaries beyond their traditional international limits against the expressed opposition of the United States. The national responsibility for conducting our international relations obviously must be accommodated with the legitimate interests of the States in the territory over which they are sovereign. Thus a contraction of a State's recognized territory imposed by the Federal Government in the name of foreign policy would be highly questionable. But an extension of state sovereignty to an international area by claiming it as inland water would necessarily also extend national sovereignty, and unless the Federal Government's responsibility for questions of external sovereignty is hollow, it must have the power to prevent States from so enlarging themselves. We conclude that the choice under the Convention to use the straight-base-line method for determining inland waters claimed against other nations is one that rests with the Federal Government, and not with the individual States.\n\n\nCalifornia relies upon Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240\n, for the proposition that a State may draw its boundaries as it pleases within limits recognized by the law of nations regardless of the position taken by the United States. Although some dicta in the case may be read to support that view, we do not so interpret the opinion. The case involved neither an expansion of our \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 169]\n\u00a0\n traditional international boundary nor opposition by the United States to the position taken by the State.\n\n\n2. Twenty-four-mile Closing Rule. - The Convention recognizes, and it is the present United States position,\n35\n that a 24-mile closing rule together with the semicircle test should be used for classifying bays in the United States.\n36\n Applying these tests to the segments of California's \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 170]\n\u00a0\n coast here in dispute, it appears that Monterey Bay is inland water and that none of the other coastal segments in dispute\n37\n fulfill these aspects of the Convention test. We so hold.\n\n\nCalifornia asserts that the Santa Barbara Channel may be considered a \"fictitious bay\" because the openings at both ends of the channel and between the islands are each less than 24 miles.\n38\n The United States argues that the channel is no bay at all; that it is a strait which serves as \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 171]\n\u00a0\n a useful route of communication between two areas of open sea and as such may not be classified as inland waters.\n39\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy way of analogy California directs our attention to the Breton and Chandeleur Sounds off Louisiana which the United States claims as inland waters, United States v. Louisiana, \n363 \nU.S. 1, 66\n-67, n. 108. Each of these analogies only serves to point up the validity of the United States' argument that the Santa Barbara Channel should not be treated as a bay. The Breton Sound is a cul de sac. The Chandeleur Sound, if considered separately from the Breton Sound which it joins, leads only to the Breton Sound. Neither is used as a route of passage between two areas of open sea. In fact both are so shallow as to not be readily navigable.\n40\n California also points to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. That strait is not claimed by the United States as a \"fictitious bay\" and it does not connect two areas of open sea.\n\n\nEvidence submitted to the Special Master on the extent of international use made of the Santa Barbara Channel was sparse. What evidence there was indicated the usefulness of the route, but did not specify whether the ships so using it were domestic or international.\n41\n California \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 172]\n\u00a0\n now regards the point as important, for under international law as expressed in the Corfu Channel Case, 1949. I. C. J. Rep. 4, the International Court of Justice held that a country could not claim a strait as inland water if, in its natural state, it served as a useful route for international passage. We do not consider the point of controlling importance. The United States has not in the past claimed the Santa Barbara Channel as inland water and opposes any such claim now. The channel has not been regarded as a bay either historically or geographically. In these circumstances, as with the drawing of straight base lines, we hold that if the United States does not choose to employ the concept of a \"fictitious bay\" in order to extend our international boundaries around the islands framing Santa Barbara Channel, it cannot be forced to do so by California. It is, therefore, unnecessary to reinstitute proceedings before a master to determine the factual question of whether the passageway is internationally useful.\n\n\n3. Historic Inland Waters. - By the terms of the Convention the 24-mile closing rule does not apply to so-called \"historic\" bays.\n42\n Essentially these are bays over which a coastal nation has traditionally asserted and maintained dominion with the acquiescence of foreign nations.\n43\n California claims that virtually all the waters here in dispute are historic inland waters as the term is internationally understood. It relies primarily on an interpretation of its State Constitution to the effect that \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 173]\n\u00a0\n the state boundaries run three miles outside the islands and bays,\n44\n plus several court decisions which so interpret it as applied to Monterey, Santa Monica, and San Pedro Bays.\n45\n The United States counters that, as with straight base lines, California can maintain no claim to historic inland waters unless the claim is endorsed by the United States. The Special Master found it unnecessary to decide that question because, on the evidence before him, he concluded that California had not traditionally exercised dominion over any of the claimed waters.\n\n\nSince the 24-mile rule includes Monterey Bay, we do not consider it here. As to Santa Monica Bay, San Pedro Bay, and the other water areas in dispute, we agree with the Special Master that they are not historic inland waters of the United States.\n\n\nCalifornia contends that two studies of the criteria for determining historic waters have been made since the Special Master filed his report\n46\n which show that he applied the wrong standards, thus vitiating his conclusions. In particular it is said that the Special Master \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 174]\n\u00a0\n erroneously thought the concept of historic waters to be an exception to the general rule of inland waters requiring a rigorous standard of proof. We find no substantial indication of this in his report.\n\n\nOn the evidence, California's claim that its constitution set a boundary beyond the bays and islands is arguable, but many of the state statutes drawing county boundaries which supposedly run to the limit of the state boundaries cut the other way by indicating a line only three miles from shore.\n47\n Furthermore, a legislative declaration of jurisdiction without evidence of further active and continuous assertion of dominion over the waters is not sufficient to establish the claim.\n48\n There is a federal district court opinion. United States v. Carrillo, 13 F. Supp. 121 (1935), which dismissed federal criminal charges for an offense which took place more than three miles from the shore of San Pedro Bay on the ground that the bay was within California, not federal, jurisdiction; but it is difficult to see this dismissal as an assertion of dominion. In Santa Monica Bay, California did successfully prosecute a criminal offense which took place more than three miles from the shore, People v. Stralla, 14 Cal. 2d 617, 96 P.2d 941 (1939). However, the decision stands as the only \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 175]\n\u00a0\n assertion of criminal jurisdiction of which we have been made aware.\n49\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States disclaims that any of the disputed areas are historic inland waters. We are reluctant to hold that such a disclaimer would be decisive in all circumstances, for a case might arise in which the historic evidence was clear beyond doubt. But in the case before us, with its questionable evidence of continuous and exclusive assertions of dominion over the disputed waters, we think the disclaimer decisive.\n\n\n4. Harbors and Roadsteads. - The parties disagree as to whether inland waters should encompass anchorages beyond the outer harborworks of harbors. The Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone (Art. 8) states without qualification that \"the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system shall be regarded as forming part of the coast.\" We take that to be the line incorporated in the Submerged Lands Act.\n\n\nAs to open roadsteads used for loading, unloading and anchoring ships, the Convention (Art. 9) provides that such areas should be included in the territorial sea, and, by implication, that they are not to be considered inland waters. We adopt that interpretation.\n\n\n5. The Line of Ordinary Low Water. - Along the California coast there are two low tides each day, one of which is generally lower than the other. The assertion of the United States, with which the Special Master agreed, is that the line of ordinary low water is obtained by taking \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 176]\n\u00a0\n the average of all the low tides. California would average only the lower low tides.\n\n\nWe hold that California's position represents the better view of the matter. The Submerged Lands Act defines coastline in terms of the \"line of ordinary low water.\" The Convention (Art. 3) uses \"the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State\" (i. e., the United States). We interpret the two lines thus indicated to conform, and on the official United States coastal charts of the Pacific Coast prepared by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, it is the lower low water line which is marked.\n\n\n6. Artificial Accretions. - When this case was before the Special Master, the United States contended that it owned all mineral rights to lands outside inland waters which were submerged at the date California entered the Union, even though since enclosed or reclaimed by means of artificial structures. The Special Master ruled that lands so enclosed or filled belonged to California because such artificial changes were clearly recognized by international law to change the coastline. Furthermore, the Special Master recognized that the United States, through its control over navigable waters, had power to protect its interests from encroachment by unwarranted artificial structures, and that the effect of any future changes could thus be the subject of agreement between the parties.\n\n\nThe United States now contends that whereas the Submerged Lands Act recognized and confirmed state title within all artificial as well as natural modifications to the shoreline prior to the passage of the Act, Congress meant to recognize only natural modifications after the date of the Act. The Act, however, makes no specific reference to artificial accretions, and nowhere in the legislative history did anyone focus on the question.\n50\n The United \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 177]\n\u00a0\n States points by analogy to the rule of property law that artificial fill belongs to the owner of the submerged land onto which it is deposited. Marine R. & Coal Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 47, 65\n. We think the situation different when a State extends its land domain by pushing back the sea; in that case its sovereignty should extend to the new land, as was generally thought to be the case prior to the 1947 California opinion.\n51\n The considerations which led us to reject the possibility of wholesale changes in the location of the line of inland waters caused by future changes in international law, supra, pp. 166-167, do not apply with force to the relatively slight and sporadic changes which can be brought about artificially. Arguments based on the inequity to the United States of allowing California to effect changes in the boundary between federal and state submerged lands by making future artificial changes in the coastline are met, as the Special Master pointed out, by the ability of the United States to protect itself through its power over navigable waters.\n\n\nWith the modifications set out in this opinion we approve the recommendations of the Special Master. The parties, or either of them, may, before September 1, 1965, submit a proposed decree to carry this opinion into \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 178]\n\u00a0\n effect, failing which the Court will prepare and enter an appropriate decree at the next Term of Court.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. 1301-1315 (1958 ed.).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The late William H.

Boggs, Delimitation of the Territorial Sea, 24 Am. J. Int'l L. 541, 548.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Special Master recommended as follows:\n\n\"Question 1: The channels and other water areas between the mainland and the offshore islands within the area referred to by California as the `over-all unit area' are not inland waters. They lie seaward of the baseline of the marginal belt of territorial waters, which should be measured in each instance along the shore of the adjoining mainland or island, each island having its own marginal belt.\n\n\n\"Question 2: No one of the seven particular coastal segments now under consideration for precise determination and adjudication is a bay constituting inland waters. The landmarks from which the lines marking the seaward limits (the straight-line segments of the baseline of the marginal belt) of bays, harbors, rivers and other inland waters are to be drawn, are as follows:\n\n\n\"Bays\n\n\n\"The extreme seaward limit of inland waters of a bay is a line ten nautical miles long. For indentations having pronounced headlands not more than ten nautical miles apart, and having a depth as hereinafter defined, a straight line is to be drawn across the entrance. Where the headlands are more than ten nautical miles apart, the straight line is to be drawn across the indentation at the point nearest the entrance at which the width does not exceed ten nautical miles. In either case the requisite depth is to be determined by the following criterion: The envelope of all ares of circles having a radius equal \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n to one-fourth the length of the straight line shall be drawn from all points around the shore of the indentation; if the area enclosed by the straight line across the entrance and the envelope of the arcs of the circles is greater than that of a semicircle with a diameter equal to one-half the length of the line across the entrance, the waters of the indentation shall be regarded as inland waters; if otherwise, the waters of the indentation shall be regarded as open sea.\n\n\n\"Harbors (Ports)\n\n\n\"In front of harbors the outer limit of inland waters is to embrace an anchorage reasonably related to the physical surroundings and the service requirements of the port, and, absent contrary evidence, may be assumed to be the line of the outermost permanent harbor works.\n\n\n\"River Mouths\n\n\n\"Where rivers empty into the sea, the seaward limit of inland waters is a line following the general direction of the coast drawn across the mouth of the river whatever its width. If the river flows into an estuary, the rules applicable to bays apply to the estuary.\n\n\n\"Landmarks\n\n\n\"Where pronounced headlands exist at tributary waterways, the appropriate landmark is the point of intersection of the plane of ordinary low water with the outermost extension of the natural headland. Where there is no pronounced headland, the landmark is the point of intersection of the ordinary low-water mark with a line bisecting the angle between the general trend line of the ordinary low-water mark along the open coast and the general trend line of the ordinary low-water mark along the shore of the tributary waterway.\n\n\n\"Question 3: The `ordinary low-water mark on the coast of California' is the intersection with the shoreline (as it exists at the time of survey) of the plane of the mean of all low waters, to be established, subject to the approval of the Court, by the United States Coast & Geodetic Survey from observations made over a period of 18.6 years.\" Report of Special Master 2-5 (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Submerged Lands Act provides in relevant part:\n\n   \"AN ACT\n\n\n\"To confirm and establish the titles of the States to lands beneath navigable waters within State boundaries and to the natural resources \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n within such lands and waters, to provide for the use and control of said lands and resources, and to confirm the jurisdiction and control of the United States over the natural resources of the seabed of the Continental Shelf seaward of State boundaries.\n\n\n\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

Senate Hearings 957 (remarks of Senator Holland).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Several amendments were offered and defeated which would have limited the grant to the international three-mile limit or to three miles from the shoreline around the entire coastal perimeter of the United States, thus cutting off any claims to a three-league limit by the Gulf Coast States. See 99 Cong. Rec. 4157, 4203, 4473-4478. The reason for the unacceptability of these amendments to the leaders of the measure, largely composed of Senators from the Gulf Coast States, is obvious, and had nothing to do with any particular concept of inland waters.\n\n\nSenator Douglas introduced amendments specifically designed to prevent States from claiming as inland waters those water areas between the mainland and remote islands. Section 2 (c), as amended, would have read: \"The term `coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast of the main continent which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters, and in the case of any island seaward of such coast, means the line of ordinary low water around such island.\" 99 Cong. Rec. 4240. (Amendments italicized.) The colloquy leading to the rejection of these amendments is extremely revealing in the total absence of hostility to the basic idea which Senator Douglas was pursuing and the absence of any understanding by the leaders of the measure that it embodied an historical definition of inland waters.\n\n\"Mr. DOUGLAS, Mr. President, this amendment is designed to clear up an ambiguity in the pending joint resolution and to conform to what the distinguished Senator from Florida [Mr. HOLLAND] the author of the joint resolution, stated was its real intention.\n\n\n\"One of the problems connected with the joint resolution is the problem of where the base line is, from which the submerged lands seaward from the low-water mark are to be measured. Senate Joint Resolution 13 defines this location as the `coastline,' but it is not precisely certain in my mind or in the mind of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. CORDON] whose interpretation I requested, what is meant by the word `coastline.' In the main debate on the joint resolution, I pointed out that this definition might mean 1 of 2 things. First, it might mean, what I hoped it would mean; namely, the shoreline of the main continental land mass and the external limits of inland \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 159]\n\u00a0\n waters; and then, in the case of islands, the shorelines of each of those islands.\n\n\n\"But I pointed out that probably there would be a contrary claim, particularly in the case of California, and that an attempt would be made to define the term `coastline' as being a line drawn from the main continent out to and along the outer edge of the outer islands lying off the coast. This is a tremendously important subject. It involves very substantial areas, particularly in the case of California. If it is the latter definition which is to be used, then the water between the remote islands - however far out - and the main continental land mass would become inland waters, not external waters, and all the intervening submerged lands would become the property of the coastal State.\n\n\n\n .   .   .  .  .\n\n\"Mr. LONG. Mr. President, I can understand the argument made by the Senator from Illinois, but I believe his amendment completely fails to reach the objective he is striving to achieve.\n\n\n\"If one examines the testimony of the representative of the Department of State, he will see that it is the position of the State Department of the present administration, as it was also the position of the previous administration, and, so far as I know, of all other administrations, that the marginal sea begins wherever the line of inland waters ends. That is a very simple position to take in the case of a straight coast line, as is the situation with regard to the State of Texas. There the shore line and the coast line are synonymous in almost all instances.\n\n\n\"However, the situation becomes more complicated when we consider a coast having many indentures, islands, sounds, coves, bays, and the like. At present there is a difference of opinion between the State governments and the Federal Government as to precisely where the line of inland waters is located. But it is well agreed, as it has always been agreed, that the marginal sea begins at the point where the line of inland waters ends.\n\n\n\"I should like to apply that definition to the State of Louisiana. I regret that I do not have here a map of Louisiana for the purpose of demonstrating my point, but all who have made a study of the question agree that a body of water known as Chandeleur Sound is \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 160]\n\u00a0\n inland water. In that area there is a large number of islands, each island close to another. It is agreed by both the Federal Government and the State government, and it has always been agreed, that Chandeleur Sound is inland water. The effect of the Douglas amendment would be to make Chandeleur Sound a part of the high seas, although the Federal Government has never contended that Chandeleur Sound was a part of the high seas, and the State government has always claimed it was inland water.\n\n\n\"Likewise, in the case of bays, it is the position of the State Department that bays not wider than 10 miles are inland waters. The distance of 10 miles between headlands across the mouth of a bay marks the place where the marginal sea begins. The amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois would have the effect once again of declaring such a bay to be a part of the high seas, merely because it is wider than 6 miles between headlands.\n\n\n\"Obviously, the Senator from Illinois is submitting his own definition of inland waters. In effect, it is a definition of inland waters which does not have the support of a single State government in the United States; it does not have the support of the State Department; it is a definition that does not meet with the approval of the Department of Justice; it is a definition, in effect, that does not meet with the approval of a single department of either the Federal Government or the State governments.\n\n\n\"There is no authority for accepting the inference of this amendment, namely, that the definition of inland waters is that they begin at the shore line or where 3-mile lines from headlands intersect in a bay. There is no support for this type of amendment, other than that it appeals to the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n\"The committee has struggled with this problem. The committee struggled with several different formulas for defining inland waters. Originally, the joint resolution provided that inland waters should include all bays, sounds, straits, and estuaries. However, there was some objection to that definition by the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice contended that it would be far more preferable not to attempt to define inland waters, but simply to use the words `inland waters,' to meet the standard that those words would ordinarily suggest. Therefore, at the suggestion of the Department \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 161]\n\u00a0\n of Justice, and I suppose with the support of the Department of State, the words `including all bays, estuaries, straits, and sounds,' were stricken from the joint resolution.\n\n\n\"I submit that the language of the joint resolution is the best agreement that could be reached, upon the advice of the competent officials of the State Department and the Justice Department, as well as the advice that the committee had available to it from all the witnesses who testified, and therefore we should retain the committee language rather than accept the definition of the Senator from Illinois.\n\n .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"Mr. DANIEL. Is it not true that there are some islands off the main continent which are not as far as 3 miles distant, and that this amendment would confuse the situation with reference to them? . . . We would have to apply this amendment instead of the present rule of inland waters which permits both the Nation and the State to measure from the outer line along those islands.\n\n.   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"Mr. HOLLAND. . . .\n\n\n\"I think I understand what the Senator [Douglas] is trying to attain. What he is trying to attain is in complete accord with the belief of the Senator from Florida, that islands which are far remote from the coast, and clear beyond inland waters by any reasonable conception, have a 3-mile submerged shelf around each of them; and while that fact is clearly shown in the statement of international law furnished to the committee in the last Congress by the Secretary of State at that time, Mr. Dean Acheson, the proposed amendment would not effectuate that situation at all . . . .\"\n\n\n\n The amendment was defeated 50 to 26. 99 Cong. Rec. 4240-4243.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] See, e. g., 99 Cong. Rec. 3110-3112 (remarks of Senator Hill).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The 1947 case raised the purely legal question - who owned the lands and mineral rights beneath the marginal sea belt? In deciding that they belonged to the United States the Court relied heavily on the international responsibilities of the Federal Government.\n\n\"But whatever any nation does in the open sea, which detracts from its common usefulness to nations, or which another nation may charge detracts from it, is a question for consideration among nations as such, and not their separate governmental units. What this Government does, or even what the states do, anywhere in the ocean, is a subject upon which the nation may enter into the assume treaty or similar international obligations.\" \n332 \nU.S. 19, 35\n (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n The opinion also established that landlocked waters not a part of the open sea are not part of the marginal belt, and belong to the States. The only problem remaining in the way of actually fixing the location of the marginal belt, and hence the dividing line of ownership between the State and the United States, was that of determining where the open sea ends and landlocked waters begin. The Court specifically left that question unresolved. It is precisely that problem of defining what constitutes open sea and what constitutes inland waters which we must decide in the present case.\n\n\nResolution of that question will (1) determine for the present the location of the marginal belt which we claim against other nations, and (2) define the areas within which ships of foreign nations have no right of innocent passage. Unquestionably, the definitions of what constitutes open sea and inland waters is, to borrow the words of the 1947 opinion, \"a subject upon which the nation may enter into and assume treaty or similar international obligations.\" Negotiations at \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 163]\n\u00a0\n The Hague beginning in 1930 were directed to just that end, and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to which we became a party in 1961, now establishes rules for separating the open sea from inland waters.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Letter from Acting Secretary of State Webb to Attorney General McGrath, November 13, 1951, Senate Hearings 460: letter from Secretary of State Acheson to Attorney General McGrath, February 12, 1952, Senate Hearings 462.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] See n. 5, supra.

That is in the present tense. It is the coastline as of now. We have confirmed here 3 miles from the coastline as of now. . . .\n\n\n\"If we attempt now to discuss a coastline of 1783, or whenever the Revolutionary War was concluded and the treaty was signed - \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 166]\n\u00a0\n and I do not just now recall the date - if we attempt now to determine a coastline as of then, it would seem to me that we increase our difficulties beyond what, as I understand the bill, we envisioned in the first place, but which we left where they were.\" Senate Hearings 1354-1355.\n\n\n\n That statement was made in reply to a suggestion that a State should have the choice of extending its boundaries three miles from its present coastline or three miles from its coastline as of the time it entered the Union. Senator Cordon's reply expresses his opposition to that idea on the ground that the exact location of the ancient shoreline would be extremely difficult to determine. It reveals no intent to restrict the courts in framing the definitions to be used to determine the present coastline.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] Article 4 of the Convention provides:\n\n\"1. In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\n\n\n\"2. The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the regime of internal waters.\n\n\n\"3. Baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them.\n\n\n\"4. Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under the provisions of paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 168]\n\u00a0\n concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.\n\n\n\"5. The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off from the high seas the territorial sea of another State.\n\n\n\"6. The coastal State must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts, to which due publicity must be given.\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] Letter from Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, to Robert Kennedy, Attorney General, January 15, 1963, II International Legal Materials 527; Brief for the United States in Answer to California's Exceptions 148.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The full text of Article 7 is as follows:\n\n\"1. This article relates only to bays the coasts of which belong to a single State.\n\n\n\"2. For the purposes of these articles, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.\n\n\n\"3. For the purpose of measurement, the area of an indentation is that lying between the low-water mark around the shore of the indentation and a line joining the low-water marks of its natural entrance points. Where, because of the presence of islands, an indentation has more than one mouth, the semi-circle shall be drawn on a line as long as the sum total of the lengths of the lines across the different mouths. Islands within an indentation shall be included as if they were part of the water areas of the indentation.\n\n\n\"4. If the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay does not exceed twenty-four miles, a closing line may be drawn between these two low-water marks, and the waters enclosed thereby shall be considered as internal waters.\n\n\n\"5. Where the distance between the low-water marks of the natural entrance points of a bay exceeds twenty-four miles, a straight baseline of twenty-four miles shall be drawn within the bay in such a manner as to enclose the maximum area of water that is possible with a line of that length.\n\n\n\"6. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to so-called `historic' bays, or in any case where the straight baseline system provided for in article 4 is applied.\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] The parties stated that Crescent City Bay is no longer an area in dispute.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] The United States asserts that \"international law recognizes no principle of `fictitious bays.'\" We find it unnecessary to decide that question. The Government states:\n\n\"The expression seems to have originated in a proposal by the Committee of Experts, made to the Fifth Session of the International Law Commission, suggesting a 10-mile rule for bays, a general 10-mile limit for straight baselines, providing that baselines should not be drawn to islands more than 5 miles from shore, and limiting baselines to 5 miles in groups of islands or between such groups and the mainland, except that in such a group one opening could be 10 miles. The latter situation was called a `fictitious bay.'

The Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of Its Eighth Session, p. 45, fn. 1 (U. N. Doc.

JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\n\nIn 1947 in United States v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 19\n, this Court held that the United States had paramount rights in the waters and submerged lands lying adjacent to its coastlines. A Special Master was appointed to apply the rule of that case to segments of submerged land off the mainland of California. In 1953 Congress, believing that this Court's decision unfairly denied to the coastal States submerged lands within their historic boundaries, passed the Submerged Lands Act to upset that decision and restore to the States what Congress believed had historically and rightfully been theirs. The Court today decides this case on the basis of the 13-year-old Master's Report which attempted to carry out the 1947 California opinion and decree. Instead of relying on that 1952 Report which was based on a decision which Congress in 1953 forcefully and emphatically rejected in the Submerged Lands Act, I would refer this case to a Master for new hearings, findings and recommendations to be made in light of the Submerged Lands Act, the controlling statutory law as it now exists.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe issue in this case is whether California or the United States is the owner of seven segments of land lying under the sea off the mainland of California.\n1\n Most \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 179]\n\u00a0\n of the segments lie under or outside what are called bays in popular usage, and as to them the question is whether and how much of the land underlying them and the marginal sea beyond belongs to California.\n2\n One large segment, which also includes two of the bays in issue, touches the sea opposite a chain of islands which lie up to approximately 50 miles off the mainland, separated by the Santa Barbara Channel, the San Pedro Channel, and the Gulf of Santa Catalina.\n3\n As to that segment, California claims ownership of the sea bottom under the water separating the islands from the mainland and three miles beyond the islands, while the United States argues that California owns only a strip three geographic miles wide around each island and one extending three geographic miles from the mainland shore, with the intervening submerged land all belonging to the Federal Government. In order to understand the present contentions of the parties, it is necessary to go back to the years before 1945, the year in which the dispute of which the present controversy is an aftermath came before this Court.\n\n\nFor many decades some of the States bordering on the sea had claimed dominion over water and submerged lands lying off their shores. Their claims usually were stated as extending into the open sea a distance of three statute \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 180]\n\u00a0\n miles, three geographic miles, or three marine leagues from their \"coast lines.\"\n4\n But \"coast line,\" as the term was used in many such claims, and as it is used in modern geographic descriptions, does not mean simply the low-water mark of the mainland shore; rather, it means a legally recognized line which follows the low-water mark of the shore where the shore is relatively straight and facing open sea, and which at other points follows the recognized outside limits of \"inland waters.\" which flow into the sea or form indentations in the land. Such \"inland waters\" may include certain estuaries, bays and harbors, and waters between a mainland and offshore islands.\n\n\nFor many years the Federal Government raised no objection to the various States' claims that their boundaries, including claims to the marginal sea, extended outward for various distances into the sea. However, by the 1930's it became apparent that the submerged lands off the shores of certain States contained rich and valuable oil reserves and other natural resources. In the late 1930's it was for the first time asserted that in spite of the States' historic claims the United States, and not the respective coastal States, was the owner of all submerged lands lying both within and without the three-mile limits, except for land under \"inland waters.\"\n5\n California and other States claimed that they were the owners of all submerged lands within their historic boundaries dating back to their respective admissions to the Union, including of course both historic inland waters and a three-mile or three-league strip of marginal sea beyond. To settle this controversy the United States in 1945 \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 181]\n\u00a0\n brought in this Court the action against California of which today's decision is an aftermath, alleging that the United States was \"the owner in fee simple of, or possessed of paramount rights in and powers over, the lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the Pacific Ocean, lying seaward of the ordinary low water mark on the coast of California and outside of the inland waters of the State, extending seaward three nautical miles . . . .\" California objected immediately that the complaint was vague because the Government did not make clear how broadly or narrowly it defined \"inland waters.\" California also answered that its historic boundaries as set out in its constitution in 1849, approved when it was admitted to the Union, included not only a strip out to three miles from its coast, but also \"all the islands, harbors, and bays along and adjacent to the Pacific coast,\" and that therefore \"all lands under all navigable waters within the boundaries of the State\" belonged to it. This Court then held in 1947 in United States v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 19\n, that the United States and not California had paramount rights in all the waters and submerged lands within the three-mile belt of marginal sea \"outside of the inland waters.\" \n332 \nU.S. 804, 805\n. See also United States v. Louisiana, \n339 \nU.S. 699\n; United States v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 707\n. As for the problem of deciding what were inland waters and what were not, and of drawing an exact demarcation between the inland waters and a three-mile strip of marginal sea, this Court said that \"there is no reason why, after determining in general who owns the three-mile belt here involved, the Court might not later, if necessary, have more detailed hearings in order to determine with greater definiteness particular segments of the boundary.\" \n332 \nU.S., at 26\n.\n\n\nIt was not long before such hearings did become necessary, for the United States and California found themselves in sharp disagreement as to what the term \"inland \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 182]\n\u00a0\n waters\" meant when applied to specific segments of the California coast. Both parties assumed at that time, long before the Submerged Lands Act was passed, that the term was to be given a content derived from the usage of international law and the United States' foreign relations, since the California decision in upholding the claim of the United States to land under the three-mile belt of marginal sea had relied on the necessity of federal protection and control of the territorial seas as an incident of national sovereignty. But the doctrines of international law were so confused and contradictory as to exactly what measurements a bay must have to be inland water, and under what conditions a channel between islands and the mainland was inland water, that both sides were able to find precedents supporting them. This Court therefore submitted the case to a Special Master to make findings of fact and recommendations of law as to whether each of seven segments of submerged land off the mainland of California, the same seven now in dispute, should be treated as \"inland waters\" within the meaning of the California opinion and decree, and therefore the property of the State.\n6\n\u00a0\n342 \nU.S. 891\n. On October 14, 1952, the Master filed his Report, \n344 \nU.S. 872\n, in which he said he assumed that the test of whether the land in dispute belonged to California depended on whether it was inland water \"by (1) any customary, generally recognized rule of international law . . . or by (2) effective assertion by the United States on its own behalf in its international relations.\" He thus considered any claim based on the historic boundaries of the State as totally irrelevant, as having been rejected in this Court's 1947 opinion, and he ruled in substance that the United States was the owner of the submerged lands in question to the extent it claimed. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 183]\n\u00a0\n Whether the test he used correctly interpreted the opinion need not concern us at this point. California of course filed exceptions, as did the United States. Then in 1953 Congress entered the picture by passing the Submerged Lands Act, and for more than 10 years, during which neither of the parties took any further steps in this Court and the Master's Report lay dormant, it appeared that the Act of Congress had determined the dispute.\n\n\nThe Submerged Lands Act of 1953\n7\n gave to the coastal States \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States, and the natural resources within such lands and waters . . . .\"\n8\n It defined \"lands beneath navigable waters\" as all submerged land lying within three geographic miles seaward of the \"coast line\" of the State,\n9\n which was in turn stated to be the low-water mark where the mainland was in direct contact with the open sea, and elsewhere the seaward limit of the \"inland waters.\"\n10\n The Act said, in language of extreme importance to the resolution of the present dispute at the present time, that each State was to have title to submerged lands \"to the boundary line of each such State\"\n11\n with the term \"boundaries\" meaning \"the seaward boundaries of a State . . . as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union, or as heretofore approved by the Congress,\"\n12\n up to a limit of three geographic miles from the coastline in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and three leagues from the coastline in the Gulf of Mexico.\n13\n Thus each State was given title to the submerged lands \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 184]\n\u00a0\n off its shores out as far as its boundaries at the time the State entered the Union, which were stated not to go more than three miles (or leagues) beyond its \"coast line.\" The \"coast line\" was the outer limit of its \"inland waters.\" The basic question here is whether the State's \"coast line\" as the term is used in the Act is to be determined by looking at the State's historic boundaries when it entered the Union, or by the standard used by the Master in carrying out the California decree.\n\n\nFor 10 years after the Act was passed transferring title to these submerged lands to the States, no further action in the case pending in this Court was taken by either the United States or California.\n14\n California's original claim that these bays and channels were inland waters within the meaning of this Court's decree had ceased to be so important, since the States had been given title to all the submerged lands out to their historic boundaries, including recognition of their claims to three miles or leagues of the marginal sea. After 10 years had passed, however, exploitation of undersea oil resources had become possible in deep water at great distances from the mainland, and the United States raised this present dispute with California concerning where the outer limit of the submerged land given the State by the Submerged Lands Act lay. The United States contends that this depends on the location of the \"coast line\" since the State's added rights extended three miles from the \"coast line,\" and that the location of the \"coast line\" depends in turn on the location of the seaward edge of the \"inland waters,\" which the United States argues should be measured according to the definition of \"inland waters\" used by the Master in his hearings in the California case; the United States further argues that the report of the Master settled the case, and that the subsequent passage of the Submerged \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 185]\n\u00a0\n Lands Act had no effect on the correctness of the standard he used. California replies that since the stated purpose of the Act was to restore the States' claims to the submerged lands within their historic boundaries, which included all waters within the States' boundaries as inland waters and three miles beyond into the territorial sea, the \"coast line\" or seaward edge of the \"inland waters\" was to be defined in terms of what a State had historically claimed was its coastline, the line from which it had measured its boundary, by its three-mile claim to the marginal sea. In other words, the United States proposes that in measuring California's submerged lands even under the Submerged Lands Act this Court should start with a line of internationally defined \"inland waters\" as applied by the Master in carrying out the decree in the California case, and measure three miles out. California argues that since the effect of the California case was rejected by the Submerged Lands Act, this Court should look only to the Submerged Lands Act for the governing law and in defining the State's boundary should start with the coastline as historically recognized when the State was admitted to the Union, from which the State measured its three-mile claim of marginal sea, and measure three miles outward from that historic coastline, thus restoring the State's historic boundaries. I think that the language and purpose of the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 show that California is right.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThis Court's 1947 holding precipitated one of the most hotly contested political issues of the post-war decade. Critics of the decision said that it had come as a complete surprise and had effectively taken away from the coastal States what they and others had thought from the time they entered the Union and before belonged to them. In 1952 a resolution passed both houses of Congress designed to \"restore\" to the States the submerged lands which they \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 186]\n\u00a0\n had thought they owned before the California decision.\n15\n Many opposed this bill as a \"give away\" of the federal public domain, and President Truman prevented the bill's passage by vetoing it.\n16\n Even in so doing, however, he recognized frankly that \"Even so careful and zealous a guardian of the public interest as the late Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, at first assumed that the undersea lands were owned by the States.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe controversy over whether to upset the Federal Government's title which this Court had declared in the 1947 decision continued, however, and on January 9, 1953, Senator Holland of Florida on behalf of himself and 39 other Senators introduced a bill, Senate Joint Resolution 13,\n18\n which was identical with the bill which had passed the previous year and which, with various amendments, passed both houses of Congress, was signed by President Eisenhower, and became law as the Submerged Lands Act of 1953. The stated purpose of the law as enacted was\n\n\"To confirm and establish the titles of the States to lands beneath navigable waters within State boundaries and to the natural resources within such lands and waters . . . and to confirm the jurisdiction and control of the United States over the natural resources of the seabed of the Continental Shelf seaward of State boundaries.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 187]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n As the first witness to testify at the Senate committee hearings on his bill, Senator Holland said that\n\n\"the general purpose of Senate Joint Resolution 13 is to recognize, confirm, establish, and vest in the several States - and this means all 48 of them - the submerged lands and the natural resources therein within their respective boundaries, subject to the exercise of all of the powers of regulation of the Federal Government for the purpose of commerce, navigation, national defense, and international affairs, none of which Federal powers include any property rights. This joint resolution will confirm to the maritime States - of which there are 20 - the rights which they had respectively enjoyed since the founding of our Nation and up to the date of the decision in the California case, in their offshore lands and waters which lie within their constitutional boundaries.\"\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Its object, he said, was \"restoring to the States their plenary rights, property, jurisdiction, and control which they exercised without question for 150 years over the areas lying within State boundaries.\"\n21\n It dealt only, he said, with the area within \"the States' historic or constitutional boundaries.\"\n22\n Those who testified in favor of the bill stated their objective the same way. Thus Secretary of the Interior McKay said:\n\n \"I do believe that the national interest would be best served by restoring to the various States the coastal offshore lands to the limits of the line marked \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 188]\n\u00a0\n by the historical boundaries of each of the respective States.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n There can be no doubt, I believe, and I do not understand the Court to question, that, as proposed to the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs by Senator Holland and others, the bill which became the Submerged Lands Act unquestionably was intended to give the States title to all the offshore lands going out at least as far as the respective States' historic boundaries. A brief filed in this Court in another case shows that in the reported deliberations on the bill the term \"historic State boundaries\" was used 813 times, \"original boundaries\" 121 times, and \"traditional\" boundaries 114 times.\n24\n Since I take it that the Court concedes that this was the original purpose, see ante, pp. 153-154, I shall not bother to set forth all the statements of proponents of the bill at the Senate hearings, as well as at the House hearings, which stated flatly that this was its purpose.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWe start then from the conceded fact that the bill as originally introduced gave California title to all the submerged lands off its shore out to its historic boundaries, whatever they might prove to be. The Court, however, pins its case for denying California those historic boundaries on what it calls two \"relevant,\" indeed fundamental, changes, ante, p. 150, made in the bill prior to its passage, which the Court says show that the bill's sponsors suddenly altered their intent and decided instead of restoring to California and other States mineral rights within their historic boundaries, to limit them to a three-mile or three-league \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 189]\n\u00a0\n strip of marginal waters along \"coast lines\" which were to be restrictively defined according to current policies of international relations adhered to by the State Department. A study of the legislative history convinces me that in making the two changes on which the Court relies, the Senators intended in no way to alter the purpose of the original Holland bill to restore to the States all the waters and submerged lands within their historic constitutional boundaries. They expressly, vigorously and repeatedly avowed that the original purpose was unchanged.\n\n  A. THE REMOVAL OF THE DEFINITION OF   \"INLAND WATERS.\"\n\n\n\n As originally drafted, 2 of the Holland bill defined \"inland waters,\" which extended to the \"coast line,\" as including\n\n\"all estuaries, ports, harbors, bays, channels, straits, historic bays, and sounds, and all other bodies of water which join the open sea.\"\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This definition would of course unquestionably give California title to submerged lands lying under all its historically recognized bays and straits as part of California's \"inland waters,\" quite apart from the fact that they might also lie within California's historic boundary of inland waters plus marginal sea. The Deputy Legal Adviser of the State Department testified that such a legislative definition of inland waters, even though limited to the purpose of the bill of affecting property rights between the United States and the States, \"a purely domestic matter,\"\n26\n might possibly embarrass the State Department in its foreign relations if the Department asserted a different definition of the words \"inland waters\" in its relations \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 190]\n\u00a0\n with foreign nations.\n27\n The Attorney General warned that to attempt to define the coastline in a few words might increase rather than diminish litigation.\n28\n As a result, Senator Cordon, the Acting Chairman of the Committee, at the conclusion of the hearings quoted the language defining \"inland waters\" for purposes of the Act and said:\n\n \"That language was objectionable to the State Department and to the Department of Justice. That isn't, in itself, in my opinion, reason to strike it, but I am of the opinion that the objections were sound. The matter of inland waters is one that has been defined time and time again by the courts, not, I believe, in any one all-inclusive definition, but it was felt that the use of these words were an attempted legislative definition of the term `inland waters,' and it was inadvisable for us in this bill, which is a transfer of title, to attempt to make law in the other field of what is or is not inland water.\"\n29\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n At another point he explained that the language was struck simply because\n\n \"It was sought not to get into that field because you were in a field then where, in our attempts to take care of a purely domestic matter, we might be putting the United States on record with a precedent which we intended only to apply domestically but which might be applied internationally.\"\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n He emphasized that\n\n \"The elimination of the language still follows what the Chair understands to be the philosophy of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 191]\n\u00a0\n bill, that we are putting the States where they thought they were, and not attempting now to create either a situation in law or a basis for a rule of evidence that may or may not have been sound when the States came into the Union.\"\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Senator Daniel of Texas, a leading advocate and sponsor of the bill, said:\n\n\"I agree fully with the chairman that the striking of these words was not done in any manner to prejudice the rights of the States . . . . I just want to state that for the record, if this record is ever used in the future.\"\n32\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Senator Cordon, who had proposed the change, replied:\n\n \"I appreciate the statement of the Senator, and I concur in it, so far as the action taken here is concerned.\"\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n And Senator Anderson, another member of the Committee reporting the bill, agreed:\n\n\"I subscribe fully to what the chairman said quite awhile ago in pointing out that this bill does not seek to take away from or add to the position of these States as they came into the Union.\"\n34\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n When the bill was reported out of committee and presented to the Senate, its supporters made clear that the Committee had made no change in its original objective of restoring to the States everything within their historic boundaries. Senator Holland said it was an \"obvious fact\"\n35\n that the bill was \"giving to the States that which, without question, was enjoyed by them for 150 or 160 \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 192]\n\u00a0\n years, namely, the ownership of everything within State boundaries, and reserving to the Federal Government everything beyond that.\"\n36\n Senator Cordon expressed his understanding that\n\n \"The boundaries of the States cannot be changed by Congress without the consent of the States. We cannot do anything legislatively in that field, and we have not sought to do so in this measure.\n\n\n \"I think that answers all and every one of the discussions with reference to boundary lines of the States, including whether they are measured from low water, high water, inland water, or some island.\"\n37\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n And Senator Holland said:\n\n\"By way of a brief summary, the general purpose of this measure as reported by the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee is to recognize, confirm, establish, and vest in and assign to the respective States the title and ownership of the lands and resources beneath navigable waters within their respective boundaries . . . .\"\n38\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n And Senator Daniel explained:\n\n\"Until recently the Federal Government never thought it owned these lands, and even until now it has never possessed or used them. The lands are still in the possession of the States . . . . The passage of the pending proposed legislation will simply permit the States to keep what they have always had since the foundation of the Union.\"\n39\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n If that were not enough to show that the removal of the definition of inland waters from 2 of the bill as a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 193]\n\u00a0\n courtesy to the State and Justice Departments was to have no substantive effect, the Senate Committee said at the beginning of its report on its version of the bill:\n\n \"The committee wishes to emphasize that, as will be seen from comparison with the measure as introduced, the changes are primarily those of form and language, and the committee amendment is consistent throughout with the philosophy and intent of Senate Joint Resolution 13 as introduced. The only change of substance is found in section 9, in which the jurisdiction and control of the Federal Government over the natural resources of the seabed of the Continental Shelf seaward of historic State boundaries is confirmed.\"\n40\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thus the continued intention to confer on the States all submerged lands within their \"historic boundaries\" was again reiterated. And in a specific reference to the elimination of the definition of inland waters from 2, the Committee Report said that the words had been deleted\n\n\"because of the committee's belief that the question of what constitutes inland waters should be left where Congress finds it. The committee is convinced that the definition neither adds nor takes away anything a State may have now in the way of a coast and the lands underneath waters behind it.\"\n41\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Committee had before it the report of the Special Master in this very case\n42\n and did not adopt his criteria, based on the California decision, for determining inland waters, criteria which included the Boggs formula for determining bays, a formula which many Senators indicated they disapproved and which the Committee Report specifically stated it did not mean to establish as the law. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 194]\n\u00a0\n Clearly the position of the Committee was that it really cared only about restoring to the States their claims to submerged lands within their historic boundaries, which of course included all the lands, bays, harbors and channels within those boundaries - their historic coastlines - and three miles or leagues of marginal sea.\n43\n The Committee saw no reason to attempt to spell out its definition of inland waters, as including all historic bays and channels, when there was no reason to do so and when to do so might possibly have embarrassing repercussions on American foreign relations, where different definitions of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 195]\n\u00a0\n inland waters prevailed. Lest anyone misconstrue the change, the Committee said with reference to it:\n\n\"The elimination of the language, in the committee's opinion, is consistent with the philosophy of the Holland bill to place the States in the position in which both they and the Federal Government thought they were for more than a century and a half, and not to create any situations with respect thereto.\"\n44\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court reads this change in words as showing \"a legislative intent to leave the definition of inland waters to the courts without restriction.\" Ante, p. 154. The Court agrees that before this change was made, the bill gave the States all the submerged lands out to their historic boundaries. The Court admits that the 1947 California decision rejected the States' claims to their historic boundaries and, according to the Court, set up a test of international law and foreign-policy standards for measuring inland waters. But the Court concludes that when the Committee said that it was leaving the States with the rights to inland waters which they had before the California decision, it really meant to establish the international law standard, including the Boggs formula (except insofar as that formula has since been abandoned by treaty) which many Senators had so strenuously opposed and which in their Committee Report they specifically stated they did not mean to adopt. I think that a fair reading of the discussion of this change shows that the Committee members intended that all the States should have their boundaries, including a belt of marginal sea and all the lands and waters from which they had historically measured their claims to the marginal sea, which they thought would have been recognized as such by the courts up to the time of the California decision, and that the test of inland waters and coastlines was therefore an historical one. The Committee regarded \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 196]\n\u00a0\n the California decision as a complete aberration, and assumed that before it all courts would have judged inland waters by historical tests, as in fact several California and federal decisions show they had.\n45\n I cannot understand how the Court reasons that when the Committee said that it left the States as it thought they were before the California decision, it really meant to put them in the position the Court says they were in after that case, insofar as inland waters and their coastlines are concerned. I think that the amendment did just what the Committee said it did: it freed Congress from the need of \"having to determine matters that are highly technical,\"\n46\n and left it for the States to prove if they could the facts to support their historic claims that particular bodies were inland waters behind the coastline. Senator Kuchel of California, fully familiar with the problems of California, and on the alert to protect that State's interest in the bays and channels within its historic boundaries, interpreted the bill properly, I think, when he said:\n\n \"In recognizing State ownership of lands beneath navigable waters within historic State boundaries, this joint resolution wisely makes no attempt to define exactly what those boundaries are. In substance, the resolution provides that each of the States has ownership of all lands beneath navigable waters extending, in the case of littoral States, 3 geographical miles seaward from its coastline, or to its historic boundary.\"\n47\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thus up to this point in the legislative history I think it can be said that (1) the Holland bill as originally \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 197]\n\u00a0\n drafted unquestionably gave the States title to all submerged lands out as far as their historic boundaries; and (2) the elimination of the legislative definition of inland waters did not alter the original intent of the bill in the slightest degree, but rather left it up to the States to prove that particular bays, channels or harbors were inside their coastlines as part of their \"historic boundaries,\" according to \"the position in which both they and the Federal Government thought they were for more than a century and a half.\"\n48\n\u00a0\n\n   B. THE THREE-MILE OR THREE-LEAGUE     LIMITATION.\n\n\n\n The Court calls attention to one other change in the bill before its enactment, and on the significance attributed to this one small change depends the validity of the Court's entire opinion. The Court says that this change was fundamental, of vital importance. It says that to the extent of this change, \"the philosophy [of the Holland Bill] was modified.\" Ante, p. 154. I find this altogether surprising, since when the change was introduced - by Senator Holland himself - and adopted almost immediately without any opposition being voiced, he said it was \"just a minor change of verbiage,\"\n49\n one of several \"minor changes for the purpose of clarification.\"\n50\n If the change was to have the dramatic effect which the Court attributes to it, Senator Holland certainly did not recognize it, for he said that it did \"not depart in the slightest from the intention of the sponsors of the joint resolution.\"\n51\n This amendment along with others was adopted after discussion occupying less than two pages in the Congressional Record, without a roll-call vote, without even one single objection from the Senate floor. Fundamental \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 198]\n\u00a0\n changes in the basic purpose of bills are never adopted in that way. Senator Holland's explanation that this was \"just a minor change of verbiage\" should be accepted by this Court, as I have no doubt it was accepted by the Senate.\n\n\nThis change which its sponsor thought was \"minor\" and which the Court thinks is fundamental, and on which the Court's whole argument depends, merely modified the definition of \"boundaries\" in 2 of the Act by adding:\n\n \"but in no event shall the term `boundaries' or the  term `lands beneath navigable waters' be interpreted  as extending from the coast line more than three  geographical miles into the Atlantic Ocean or the  Pacific Ocean, or more than three marine leagues  into the Gulf of Mexico.\n52\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court says that this language implicitly did away with the original and continued intention of the proponents of the bill to \"restore\" to the States the ownership of all submerged lands lying under all waters within their historic boundaries, wherever those boundaries lay, and instead established a rule that historic boundaries would not be honored if they extended more than three miles from the coastline, i. e., from the seaward edge of the inland waters as the Court today defines inland waters. The Court then reads the legislative history as destroying the historic definition of inland waters - which is, of course, all waters within a State's boundaries exclusive of claims to marginal sea - and substituting a very restrictive one based on this Court's decision in the California case, a reading which I have indicated above is, I think, flatly contrary to what the legislative history shows. The Court thus holds that by making two minor changes in the bill, which changes they said over and over again were of no substantive significance, the Senators supporting it silently repudiated in large measure their own intention, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 199]\n\u00a0\n which they had proclaimed to the public and the Senate from the beginning and continued to proclaim to the end, of restoring to the States their historic constitutional boundaries.\n\n\nThis three-mile or three-league limitation amendment was added for a very simple reason, which is plain in the Congressional Record and which shows that the sponsors of the bill were reaffirming rather than abandoning their basic original purpose in offering this and similar bills: they wished to restore to the States the submerged lands out to their historic boundaries, including three miles or leagues of marginal sea, but no farther. As reported from Committee, the bill gave the States submerged lands out to their boundaries at the time they entered the Union \"or as heretofore or hereafter approved by Congress\" without any limitation. It was feared by some that one or more of the States, none of which had ever claimed more than three miles (or leagues) of the marginal sea, might suddenly assert claims that their boundaries extended out hundreds of miles to the very limits of the Continental Shelf.\n53\n If allowed to do this, the fear was expressed, such States would be taking title to mineral wealth far beyond the historic boundaries to which the sponsors of the bill wished to confine them. The sponsors stated that their purpose was merely to \"restore\" to the States what they had thought they had had as boundaries - the outer part of the Continental Shelf was to belong to the Federal Government.\n54\n In order to prevent any States from trying to use the word \"boundaries\" in the Act to push their boundaries out beyond their historic \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 200]\n\u00a0\n three-mile or three-league claims to the marginal sea, Senator Holland himself introduced this amendment. It deleted the words \"or hereafter,\" thus limiting the States to any boundaries which they had previously claimed, in spite of any claims they might make in the future; and it also set forth as a limitation the Senators' understanding of the maximum extent of the marginal sea historically claimed by any State from or as a part of its historic boundaries: three geographical miles in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico. As Senator Holland explained, a limitation to existing boundaries had been the intention of the bill's sponsors all along, and it had been and was the understanding of the sponsors that no States claimed that their historic boundaries extended more than three miles from their coastlines in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans. He said the three-mile limitation was \"just a minor change of verbiage\"\n55\n made in order \"to make very clear that Congress at this time is seeking to do only those things which the authors and supporters of the joint resolution have so very fully, and rather repeatedly, stated for the RECORD heretofore during the course of the debate.\"\n56\n He reiterated that\n\n\"The amendment will simply indicate that this Senate, in the passage of the joint resolution, is certainly not inviting additional claims, and it knows of no additional claims.\"\n57\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Senator Holland, as the record shows, and many other Senators were well aware of California's existing claim, which is now before us, and could not have considered it to be \"additional.\"\n58\n\u00a0\n\n\nTime and time again the proponents of the bill stated before the amendment was passed that no State claimed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 201]\n\u00a0\n more than three miles or leagues of marginal sea as part of its historic boundaries, and no State would be given rights by the bill beyond those original claims. Said Senator Holland, \"I emphasize the fact that this joint resolution does not extend the boundary of any State beyond the 3-mile limit.\"\n59\n Said Senator Daniel, again before the amendment:\n\n\". . . those of us who are coauthors of this measure have always understood that it was not necessary to write into the pending legislation a specific provision that it shall not apply to lands beyond 3 miles, or 3 leagues, because all the States are claiming is 3 miles, except in the Gulf of Mexico where historic boundaries are 3 leagues from shore.\"\n60\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n He added:\n\n\"I believe that the exchange here within the past few minutes should make it very clear that the authors of this measure are not trying to give to the States, or to restore to the States, any lands outside their historic boundaries.\"\n61\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The claims of the States to a belt of marginal waters of course did not determine the location of the coastline from which such a belt would be measured. California's historic coastline, it says, was the outer limit of the bays and islands. In limiting the States to their historic claims of three miles or three leagues from their \"coast lines,\" wherever those \"coast lines\" might be, Congress unquestionably, I think, was leaving totally undisturbed the validity of their historic claims to the boundaries from which those belts would be measured. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Court's opinion lays great stress on an opinion expressed by Senator Holland that California's claim that its historic boundary of inland waters and marginal sea extended out to and three miles beyond its offshore islands was not persuasive. The Court leaves the impression that Senator Holland made a ruling that California's claim would not be covered by the Act. In fact he did nothing of the kind, but merely expressed the opinion to opponents of the bill who said that restoring the States to their historic boundaries would give them too large an area of submerged lands and who cited California's claim to the channel as an example, that he thought California would have a difficult time in proving that its historic boundary extended so far. The context of Senator Holland's remarks is important to set out in full, since when read in context his opinion, which he later repeated on several occasions, serves to emphasize that he intended that each State be allowed to prove where its historic boundaries lay, which is all that California is asking that it be allowed to do here, and which is what the Court now denies it.\n\n\nThe exchange began when Senator Long of Louisiana asked Senator Holland about how far seaward Louisiana's boundary would extend under the bill. Senator Long said:\n\n \"Now, if I understand correctly, the Senator is not proposing that the actual determination of exactly what was the historic boundary at the time Louisiana came into the Union be decided by the Congress, but rather that the question of the historic boundary of the State might be one still subject to actual judicial determination.\n\n\n \"Senator HOLLAND. Of course, the Senator is right.\n\n\n . .  .  .  . \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 203]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"Senator HOLLAND. We cannot draft general legislation that will still every possible legal question.\"\n62\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Senator Anderson of New Mexico then asked Senator Holland whether the bill validated the claim of California that its historic boundary extended to the offshore islands with a three-mile belt of marginal sea beyond them. To this Senator Holland replied:\n\n  \"The Senator from Florida can only give his  opinion, and in his opinion it would not, because of  the great depths of the water that exist between the  coastline of California and the extrusions from the  sea bottom which appear out there, and some of  which are above the level of the water. Again,  though, the Senator from Florida states that that  would be a matter, naturally, on which the courts  would be asked to rule. We are not going to find  any formula that displaces the function of the courts  to go into cases and find which cases come within the  general doctrine announced by legislation and which  fall without that legislation.\"\n63\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In other words, the bill did not settle definitively the question of fact as to whether California's historic boundary was to be measured from the outer rim of the islands. That was a question on which courts would have to hear evidence and then decide according to \"the general doctrine announced by [this] legislation\" - the doctrine, as Senator Holland and others repeated so many times, that the States were to be restored to their \"historic boundaries.\" And as he said in summary, there was nothing in his bill which would diminish California's claim to the waters and submerged lands around its offshore islands.\n64\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 204]\n\u00a0\n In later referring to the adoption of Senator Holland's amendment to the bill, Senator Daniel of Texas said, \"the intention was to write specifically into the joint resolution what the authors have said all along would be its effect - that it covered only land within the historic boundaries.\"\n65\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a further indication that the three-miles-from-coastline amendment was not intended to affect States' claims to their historic boundaries, the record shows that opponents of the bill subsequently tried to amend it to restrict the line from which the three-mile limits would be measured, and failed. Senator Douglas of Illinois, a leader of the opposition, proposed an amendment which would have changed the definition of \"coast line\" in the bill so that the three miles would be measured only from the main continent, and separately around any islands, thus cutting off California's claim to the submerged lands between the islands and the mainland, which is largely the issue before us now. Senator Douglas indicated specifically that his proposed amendment was intended to destroy California's claim to those submerged lands, and that he had warned Senator Kuchel of California of his intention to introduce it.\n66\n Senator Long of Louisiana objected that \"the Senator from Illinois is submitting his own definition of inland waters.\"\n67\n Senator Douglas' amendment was defeated,\n68\n and California's historic \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 205]\n\u00a0\n claims, for whatever they might prove to be worth, were left, as Senator Holland had stated, undiminished.\n\n\nI think that this review of the relevant hearings and debates in the Senate makes clear three things: (1) As originally proposed, the bill was intended to \"restore\" to the States title to submerged lands within their historic boundaries, whatever those might prove to be. (2) The removal of the explicit definition of inland waters, far from being, as the Court views it, fundamental, was not a \"change of substance\"\n69\n and was \"not done in any manner to prejudice the rights of the States\";\n70\n it was intended merely to avoid possible embarrassment in the field of international relations from a bill which had nothing \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 206]\n\u00a0\n to do with international relations or international law, being merely a \"transfer of title.\"\n71\n (3) The addition of the limitation of boundaries to three miles beyond the coastline, far from being, as the Court views it, fundamental, was \"just a minor change of verbiage\"\n72\n intended to make clear what the bill's sponsors had intended all along: that the bill was not designed to allow States in the future to push their boundaries out to the limits of the Continental Shelf, but rather to limit them to everything within their historic boundaries, including historic coastlines and historic three-mile or three-league claims to the marginal sea beyond.\n\n\nNear the conclusion of the debates on the bill Senator Holland in explaining its purpose used these words, which I do not think show any fundamental or even perceptible changes or modifications of philosophy from those he had used in his first speech on the bill:\n\n \"The truth is that Senate Joint Resolution 13 simply restores or gives back to the States the submerged lands within their historic boundaries which they have possessed, used and developed in good faith for over 100 years. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . It would write the law for the future as it was believed to exist in the past by restoring to the States all lands beneath navigable waters within their historic boundaries.\"\n73\n\u00a0\n\n\n   C. THE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.\n\n\n\n The hearings and debates in the House were less extensive than those in the Senate, but the intention of the legislators there to restore to the States all submerged \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 207]\n\u00a0\n lands within their historic boundaries was no less explicit. Forty different bills, of which one\n74\n was identical with the Senate Joint Resolution passed by both Houses the year before and with the Senate bill introduced by Senator Holland, were considered by the House Subcommittee and Committee. The Committee chose the latter bill and with minor perfecting amendments reported it favorably to the House.\n75\n Typical of the testimony at the hearings was the statement by Attorney General Brownell that:\n\n\"The States want, and we believe they are entitled to, all the development rights, you might say, in these submerged lands within their historic boundaries.\"\n76\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The House Committee Report on the bill said:\n\n\"Title II confirms and establishes the rights and claims of the 48 States, asserted and exercised by them throughout our country's history, to the lands beneath navigable waters within State boundaries and the resources within such lands and waters.\"\n77\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In explaining the bill to the members of the House, Congressman Willis of Louisiana, a member of the Committee and a supporter of the bill, said:\n\n \"First, it restores to the States complete title to the submerged lands up to the limit of their historic boundaries.\"\n78\n\u00a0\n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n And on the floor Congressman Wilson of Texas, also a Committee member and supporter of the bill, explained its purpose in the following exchange:\n\n \"Mr. WILSON of Texas. . . . Bear in mind that this is title II, the title that returns or restores this seaward boundary within the historical boundaries of the States to the States . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. HALLECK. If we stick to the provisions of the bill, then we are just being consistent with respect to the title to the land within the historic boundaries?\n\n\n \"Mr. WILSON of Texas. That is true.\"\n79\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The House bill, passed with this intention, was then sent to the Senate, which at that time was considering Senator Holland's bill, a virtually identical measure. After the Senate passed the Holland bill, with the two changes which the Court deems fundamental, Congressman Reed, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which had reported the House bill, asked the members of the House to accede to their bill as amended by the Senate. He prefaced his remarks by saying:\n\n \"Mr. Speaker, I trust that 3 minutes will be sufficient for me to say all that I deem necessary about this resolution.\"\n80\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n He then proceeded in these words to tell the members of the House what had happened to their bill as adopted by the Senate:\n\n \"Titles I and II of the original bill, H. R. 4198, are now before us. There have been no substantial changes made by the Senate in these titles. They are practically the same as when passed by the House \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 209]\n\u00a0\n except in a few instances where a few words and phrases here and there have been changed or deleted for clarification.\n\n\n \"About the only thing that is substantially new in this bill is a reassertion by the Senate in section 9 which confirms the rights of the United States to the jurisdiction and control of the lands under the Continental Shelf outside of State boundaries.\"\n81\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Relying on these assurances by Chairman Reed that there had been \"no substantial changes\" made in the bill by the Senate, the House without further discussion of the portions of the bill here involved proceeded to adopt the Senate version, which after being signed by the President became the Submerged Lands Act of 1953.\n\n\nThis, then, is the legislative history of the Submerged Lands Act, both in the Senate and in the House, which, according to the Court, shows that the sponsors and supporters of the Act completely altered their intention of restoring to the States the submerged lands within their historic boundaries, and instead left the States with what the Court allows them today. I think that the statements and actions of the supporters of the bill show on the contrary that the intention of restoring all submerged lands under all waters within historic state boundaries was plainly and explicitly stated and understood by all from the beginning, and, despite attacks from opponents of the bill, never varied. Time and time again the Senators and Congressmen repeated that the bill had not been changed in any way to diminish the rights granted to the States in the bill as originally introduced - rights which, as the Court does not dispute, included the right to all submerged lands under all waters within historic state boundaries. I would follow the understanding of the authors and supporters of the bill, and I would take them at their word. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nIn light of this legislative history, of which I have set forth only a small part, I think that under the Submerged Lands Act California is entitled to all the submerged lands within its historic boundaries, and that it should be given an opportunity to try to prove in hearings before a Master where those historic boundaries were. The Court says that Congress left it up to this Court to expound the legal principles which shall determine California's claims, without any reference to the Submerged Lands Act's stated purpose to restore the mineral rights of the States in submerged lands within their historic boundaries. I think the Court is completely misreading the intentions of the authors and supporters of the Act. If there is anything clear in the legislative history, it is that Congress was not satisfied with the way in which this Court had decided the California case and did not approve of the considerations of external sovereignty used there in determining a domestic dispute over title. It seems to me the height of irony to hold that an Act passed expressly to escape the effect of this Court's opinion in this field is now construed as leaving us free to announce principles directly antithetic to the basic purpose of Congress of deciding that question for itself once and for all. True, the Congress left to the courts the exercise of their historic function to decide the factual question of where a State's historic boundaries, based on those approved when it was admitted to the Union, lie. But I think the Court errs in arguing repeatedly that by leaving it to the courts to decide the issues of fact in particular cases, Congress meant to leave it to this Court to determine the legal principles governing California's claim, and in particular to do so by adopting a formula of its own devising based on one used by the State Department in its handling of foreign affairs. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCalifornia has never been given an opportunity to appear at a hearing to determine where its boundaries were when it came into the Union. The 13-year-old report of the Master quite naturally considered this issue irrelevant since the Submerged Lands Act had not been passed at the time that report was made. Certainly it cannot be asserted that California's claim that its 1849 boundaries included these areas is frivolous. By the terms of its constitution approved by Congress when the State was admitted to the Union in 1850, and over the years, California appears to have claimed that its boundaries extended beyond its outlying islands and has claimed as inland waters within those boundaries all the bays, harbors and channels in question in this lawsuit. A statement in the original California Constitution,\n82\n several official maps, including the one used at the California \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 212]\n\u00a0\n constitutional convention in 1849,\n83\n and other evidence tend to support California's contention that it historically owned these bays and the channel between the islands and the mainland. Both state and federal court decisions have held as a matter of fact and law that some of the very bays in question here, which the Government argues are not inland waters in the international sense, were within the boundaries of the State and subject to its jurisdiction. Ocean Industries, Inc. v. Greene, 15 F.2d 862 (D.C. N. D. Cal.) (Monterey Bay); United States v. Carrillo, 13 F. Supp. 121 (D.C. S. D. Cal.) (San Pedro Bay); People v. Stralla, 14 Cal. 2d 617, 96 P.2d 941 (Santa Monica Bay); Ocean Industries, Inc. v. Superior Court, 200 Cal. 235, 252 P. 722 (Monterey Bay). Indeed, in one of these cases, People v. Stralla, supra, the United States Attorney with the authorization of the Attorney General of the United States appeared as amicus curiae agreeing with the State's attorney that all of the bay in question there as here was within California's boundaries and subject to its exclusive territorial jurisdiction.\n84\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere may be evidence which tends to disprove the historic validity of California's claims. But what California has asked here is an opportunity to prove where its boundaries historically were, to use the test of ownership fixed by Congress in the Submerged Lands Act rather than the foreign-relations tests set up by the Special Master 13 years ago and approved by this Court today for the first time. I think that the legislative history of the Submerged Lands Act shows without question that the definitions in it were to be read as preserving to the maritime States their claims to submerged lands and waters within \n\n[381 \nU.S. 139, 213]\n\u00a0\n their historic boundaries, and that those who offered and supported the bill regarded California's claim to these bays, harbors and the channel out to its offshore islands as something the State would be allowed to try to prove. In litigation to determine the extent of the outer limits of the States' historic boundaries in the marginal sea in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas and Florida were allowed to prove their historic boundaries and won in United States v. Louisiana, \n363 \nU.S. 1\n, and United States v. Florida, \n363 \nU.S. 121\n, respectively. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama based their claims in the Gulf of Mexico on historic boundaries and this Court decided against them on the facts in United States v. Louisiana, supra. All five of those States were given an opportunity to try to prove their historic boundaries, in order to determine the extent of the submerged lands to which they were entitled by the Submerged Lands Act. California has had no such opportunity. California set up as an affirmative defense in 1946 that its boundaries extended to the point it presently claims. We did not pass on this contention then, for we held that regardless of where the historic boundaries were, the United States had paramount rights in all its marginal sea. The Court today still leaves the question of the State's historic boundaries undecided, except insofar as relevant to international claims of the United States, and instead decides this case on the basis of standards of international law derived from the reasoning of the 1947 California case. Congress did not, I think, mean to readopt the standards of the California case, which the authors of the Submerged Lands Act so violently criticized, and to cut California off without any chance at all to establish ownership of these bays and channels by proving that they were within the State's historic boundaries. In order to carry out what I believe to be the congressional command in the Submerged Lands Act, I would refer the case to a Special Master to give California that chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Appendix A.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Appendix B, which shows Monterey Bay, one of the bays in question. California claims that all the submerged land and waters landward of the line drawn across the headlands are inland waters within the historic coastline of the State, and that its historic boundary, the outer limit of its rights under the Submerged Lands Act, extends three miles seaward of that line. The United States claims that California owns only a belt of submerged lands within three miles of the low-water mark of the mainland shore.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Appendix C. California claims all the submerged land between the line drawn along the islands from the mainland, and a belt of marginal sea three miles to seaward of that line. The United States contends that California is entitled only to a belt within three miles of the mainland shore and three miles around each of the islands.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] One geographic (or marine or nautical) mile equals approximately 1.15 statute (or land or English) miles.

That earlier report, S. Rep. No. 1592, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., as quoted, criticised the California decision for creating great uncertainty as to what areas would be \"inland waters\" within the reasoning of the opinion. Under the federal-external-sovereignty reasoning of the California case the Committee saw no clear answer to such questions as:\n\n\"At what precise point does a bay become a part of the open sea? Are waters landward of offshore islands inland waters? Are uplands formed by nature subsequent to the date of fixing the low-water mark subject to `the paramount power' of the United States as defined by the Court's opinion?\" Senate Report 61.\n\n\n\n The Committee sought in the legislation to avoid these \"extreme complexities,\" ibid., by enacting \"a law consonant with what the States and the Supreme Court believed for more than a century was the law,\" ibid., and restoring to the States all their historic property rights both to inland waters and to the marginal sea. The Report said:\n\n\"Unless S. 1988 as reported, is enacted, confusion will exist as to the ownership and taxability of, and powers over, bays and the 3-mile belt . . . . We consider it against the public interest for the Federal Government to commence a series of vexatious lawsuits against the sovereign States to recover submerged lands within the boundaries of the States, traditionally looked upon as the property of the States under a century of pronouncements by the Supreme Court reflecting its belief that the States owned these lands.\" Id., at 62.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] Senate Report 18.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] See infra, p. 212. \"[T]he sponsors understood this Court to have established, prior to the California decision, a rule of state ownership itself defined in terms of state territorial boundaries . . . .\" United States v.

See 99 Cong. Rec. 3957-3960, 4114. Senator Cordon had objected that the \"net result\" of the amendment \"would be that an arbitrary 3-mile limit would be established, rather than to follow the philosophy of the joint resolution itself.

A. 5th Cir.).\n\nThe variations among the courts of appeals concerned the reasonableness of inferring guilt of the substantive offense from the fact of unexplained presence at the site of the criminal enterprise. It is that question which Congress has now resolved in favor of the established practice of trial judges to include the inference in their charges.\n5\n And it is the same question of reasonableness which the petitioner asks this Court to determine in passing on the constitutionality of 5601 (b) (2).\n\nAs the Court of Appeals correctly stated in this case, the constitutionality of the legislation depends upon the rationality of the connection \"between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed.\" Tot v. United States, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n \n319 \nU.S. 463, 466\n. The process of making the determination of rationality is, by its nature, highly empirical, and in matters not within specialized judicial competence or completely commonplace, significant weight should be accorded the capacity of Congress to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it. As the record in the Circuits shows, courts have differed in assessing the weight to be placed upon the fact of the defendant's unexplained presence at a still. See United States v. Freeman, 286 F.2d 262 (C. A. 4th Cir.). Yet it is precisely when courts have been unable to agree as to the exact relevance of a frequently occurring fact in an atmosphere pregnant with illegality that Congress' resolution is appropriate.\n\nThe rationality of the inference provided by 5601 (b) (2) must be viewed in the context of the broad substantive offense it supports. Section 5601 (a) (4) proscribes \"carrying on\" the enterprise of illegal distillation - an offense which is one of the most comprehensive of the criminal statutes designed to stop the production and sale of untaxed liquor. See Vukich v. United States, 28 F.2d 666, 669 (C. A. 9th Cir.). Those who aid and abet the enterpriser come within the statute's reach by virtue of 18 U.S.C. 2 (1958 ed.). United States v. Giuliano, 263 F.2d 582 (C. A. 3d Cir.). Suppliers, haulers, and a host of other functionaries have been convicted under the statute. See United States v. Pritchard, 55 F. Supp. 201 (D.C. W. D. S. C.), aff'd, 145 F.2d 240 (C. A. 4th Cir.). Congress was undoubtedly aware that manufacturers of illegal liquor are notorious for the deftness with which they locate arcane spots for plying their trade. Legislative recognition of the implications of seclusion only confirms what the folklore teaches - that strangers to the illegal business rarely penetrate the curtain of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n secrecy.\n6\n We therefore hold that 5601 (b) (2) satisfies the test of Tot v. United States, supra.\n\nBut it is said that this statute is unconstitutional upon a different ground - that it impinges upon the trial judge's powers over the judicial proceeding. We cannot agree. Our Constitution places in the hands of the trial judge the responsibility for safeguarding the integrity of the jury trial, including the right to have a case withheld from the jury when the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction. The statute before us deprives the trial judge of none of his normal judicial powers. We do not interpret the provision in the statute that unexplained \"presence . . . shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction\" as in any way invading the province of the judge's discretion. The language permits the judge to submit a case to the jury on the basis of the accused's presence alone, and to this extent it constitutes congressional recognition that the fact of presence does have probative worth in the determination of guilt. But where the only evidence is of presence the statute does not require the judge to submit the case to the jury, nor does it preclude the grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. And the Court of Appeals may still review the trial judge's denial of motions for a directed verdict or for a judgment n. o. v.\n\nThe statute does not prevent the jury from being \"properly instructed on the standards for reasonable \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n doubt.\" Holland v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 121, 139\n. In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:\n\n \"There is one other matter which I should mention. I charge you that the presence of defendants at a still, if proved, with or without flight therefrom, or attempted flight therefrom, if proved, would be a circumstance for you to consider along with all the other testimony in the case. Of course, the bare presence at a distillery and flight therefrom of an innocent man is not in and of itself enough to make him guilty. It is possible under the law for an innocent man to be present at a distillery, and it is possible for him to run when about to be apprehended, and such an innocent man ought never to be convicted, but presence at a distillery, if you think these men were present, is a circumstance to be considered along with all the other circumstances in the case in determining whether they were connected with the distillery or not. Did they have any equipment with them that was necessary at the distillery? What was the hour of day that they were there? Did the officers see them do anything? Did they make any statements?\n\n\n \"It is your duty to explore this case, analyze the evidence pro and con fairly. Presence at a still, together with other circumstances in the case, if they are sufficient in your opinion to exclude every reasonable conclusion except that they were there connected with the distillery, in an illegal manner, . . . carrying on the business as charged . . . . if you believe those things, would authorize you in finding the defendants guilty.\n\n\n \"And under a statute enacted by Congress a few years back, when a person is on trial for . . . carrying on the business of a distiller without giving bond as required by law, as charged in this case, and the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n defendant is shown to have been at the site of the place . . . where and at the time when the business of a distiller was engaged in or carried on without bond having been given, under the law such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury.\n\n\n \"Now this does not mean that the presence of the defendant at the site and place at the time referred to requires the jury to convict the defendant, if the defendant by the evidence in the case, facts and circumstances proved, fails to explain his presence to the satisfaction of the jury. It simply means that a jury may, if it sees fit, convict upon such evidence, as it shall be deemed in law sufficient to authorize a conviction, but does not require such a result.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n The jury was thus specifically told that the statutory inference was not conclusive. \"Presence\" was one circumstance to be considered among many. Even if it found that the defendant had been present at the still, and that his presence remained unexplained, the jury could nonetheless acquit him if it found that the Government had not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Holland v. United States, supra. In the absence of the statute, such an instruction to the jury would surely have been permissible. Cf. Wilson v. United States, supra. Furthermore, in the context of the instructions as a whole, we do not consider that the single phrase \"unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury\" can be fairly understood as a comment on the petitioner's failure to \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n testify.\n7\n Cf. Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287\n. The judge's overall reference was carefully directed to the evidence as a whole, with neither allusion nor innuendo based on the defendant's decision not to take the stand.\n\nIn McNamara v. Henkel, \n226 \nU.S. 520, 525\n, the Court approved a proceeding which did no more than \"accord to the evidence, if unexplained, its natural probative force.\" That is all that Congress has done here. We cannot find that the law it enacted violates the Constitution.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The evidence for the prosecution showed that an old Dodge truck with darkened headlights drove up to the site of a secluded still, hidden in a swamp in Dooly County, Georgia. The respondent, Jackie Gainey, left the truck, turned on a flashlight, and walked toward the still. There he was confronted by state and federal revenue agents. The respondent attempted to flee, but after a short chase, he and his waiting colleagues were apprehended. Since the trial, one of Gainey's co-defendants, Roy Lee Barrett, has died; the other, Cleveland Johns, elected to serve and has completed his sentence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 5601 (b) (1) provides: \"(1) Unregistered stills. \"Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a) (1) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, a still or distilling apparatus was set up without having been registered, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).\" Section 5601 (b) (2) provides: \"(2) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond. \"Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a) (4) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, the business of a distiller or rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).\" These sections were introduced into the Code in 1958. The statutory inferences are modeled after 18 U.S.C. 545 (1958 ed.), originally 4 of the Smuggling Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 178, 179. Similar \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n wording appears in 21 U.S.C. 174 (1958 ed.), the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 614, the constitutionality of which was sustained in Yee Hem v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 178\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] A third count charged a violation of 5602, which prohibits carrying on the business of a distiller with intent to defraud the United States. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on this count also, and the Government did not seek review of this reversal. A fourth count, charging that the defendants, in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5180 (1958 ed.), worked in a distillery on which no sign was placed showing the name of the person engaged in the distilling, resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways and Means on Excise Tax Technical and Administrative Problems, Part 3, p. 95, 84th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Bozza v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 160\n, contributed to congressional concern. See Hearings, note 4, supra. But that case did not deal with the problem of presence alone as insufficient evidence where the substantive offense is \"carrying on\" the enterprise of illegal distillation. Bozza's conviction for \"carrying on\" the enterprise of illegal distillation was affirmed by this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"Very few of the illicit distillers allow any one, except their most intimate friends, to approach their distilleries. Such places, as a rule, are forbidden ground, for the reason that when the violators are arrested it is a difficult matter to prove them guilty, when so few persons have ever seen them operating their distilleries.\" Atkinson, After the Moonshiners, By One of the Raiders, at p. 23. \"The first requisite for an illicit still is a good stream of cool water. . . . \"The next requisite is seclusion. It must be placed where no one ever travels, or even thinks of traveling.\" Id., at p. 18.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Indeed the better practice would be to instruct the jurors that they may draw the inference unless the evidence in the case provides a satisfactory explanation for the defendant's presence at the still, omitting any explicit reference to the statute itself in the charge.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\nThe statute which the Court finds constitutional provides:\n\n \"Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a) (4) [making it an offense to carry on the business of a distiller or rectifier without having given bond as required by law] the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, the business of a distiller or rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).\" 26 U.S.C. 5601 (b) (2).\n\n\n It would be possible to interpret the statute as compelling judges to give the following instruction to juries: \"If you find that the defendant was present at the still, then the law requires you to assume that he was there carrying on the business of a distiller within the meaning \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n of the statute; but you need not make this assumption if the defendant has given another explanation of his presence there and you are satisfied of the truth of that explanation.\" If the statute were read as compelling such an instruction, I would find it constitutionally intolerable, for the reasons so well stated by my Brother BLACK.\n\nThe Court, however, interprets the statute as merely allowing, not compelling, the jury to draw the inference of \"carrying on\" from the fact of \"presence.\" The jury is left free to reject the inference if, in light of all the circumstances of the case, a reasonable doubt remains as to the defendant's guilt. That is the way the jury would normally function, apart from the statute. So, I have concluded that the statute, as construed, merely provides a rule of evidence and no more.\n\nThere are, to be sure, dangers inherent in any statutory presumption. Perhaps the jury will be overawed if it is told that some particular factual inference has been enshrined in an Act of Congress. Therefore the Court quite rightly suggests that the better practice would be to omit \"any explicit reference to the statute itself in the charge.\" Ante, p. 71, n. 7. Or perhaps the judge may feel that the statute restricts his power to withhold an insufficient case from the jury or to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court reassures the trial judge that the statute does not thus invade the province of his discretion. Nor is the function of the appellate courts in any way circumscribed.\n\nIn my view, the acute danger in the statute as construed and applied lurks in its provision that the jury may draw the inference in question \"unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) If this meant that the judge should instruct that the inference may be drawn unless the defendant himself becomes a witness and personally \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n explains his presence at the still, then, as my Brother BLACK says, the statute would clearly subject the defendant to an impermissible compulsion to testify. But more subtly compelling instructions than that are outlawed by the same policy. It has long been the rule in the federal courts that the defendant's failure to testify ought not to be even the subject of unfavorable comment:\n\n\"It is not every one who can safely venture on the witness stand though entirely innocent of the charge against him. Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character, and offences charged against him, will often confuse and embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices against him. . . . [C]ounsel is forbidden by the statute [now 18 U.S.C. 3481]\n*\n to make any comment which would create or tend to create a presumption against the defendant from his failure to testify.\" Wilson v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 60, 66\n-67.\n\n\n Just as it is improper for counsel to argue from the defendant's silence, so is it improper for the trial judge to call attention to the fact of defendant's silence. Indeed, under 18 U.S.C. 3481 the defendant is entitled as a matter of right to have the trial judge expressly tell the jury that it must not attach any importance to the defendant's failure to testify; or, if the defendant sees fit, he may choose to have no mention made of his silence by anyone. Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 74]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI have previously expressed my view that this rule against comment on the defendant's silence is mandated by the Fifth Amendment, because \"[u]sing a defendant's silence as evidence against him is one way of having him testify against himself.\" Scott v. California, \n364 \nU.S. 471, 472\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nThe charge in the present case does not, in my view, satisfy the requirements of the Fifth Amendment. The judge told the jury that the inference could be drawn \"unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury.\" I believe the charge in that form runs counter to the federal policy that forbids conviction on compelled testimony, not only because, as my Brother BLACK points out, it puts direct pressure on the defendant to come forward and testify, but also because it amounts in practical effect to an improper comment on the defendant's silence where, as here, he resists the pressure and does not take the stand in his own behalf. Unlike the Court, therefore, I would not interpret the statute before us as attempting a pro tanto repeal of 18 U.S.C. 3481 by authorizing such an instruction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"In trial of all persons charged with the commission of offenses against the United States and in all proceedings in courts martial and courts of inquiry in any State, District, Possession or Territory, the person charged shall, at his own request, be a competent witness. His failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nRespondent Gainey was tried and convicted of possession of an unregistered still\n1\n and of carrying on the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 75]\n\u00a0\n business of a distiller without having given bond\n2\n in violation of a federal statute. Other provisions of the statute,\n3\n entitled \"Presumptions,\" declare that presence at the site of such a distillery \"shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury . . . .\" At the trial federal and state officers testified, among other things, that they had seen Gainey at a still site. Gainey did not testify. The trial court, quite appropriately if the foregoing provisions are valid, instructed the jury \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 76]\n\u00a0\n that Gainey's unexplained presence at the still was \"deemed in law sufficient\" to convict. I think that the statutory provisions which authorize such a charge deprived Gainey (1) of his constitutional right to trial by jury, guaranteed him both in Art. III, 2, and in the Sixth Amendment; (2) of due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, which includes the right to be tried for a crime in a court according to the law of the land, without any interference with that court's judicial functions by the Congress; and (3) of his right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that I am at a loss to understand the Court's puzzling statement that \"where the only evidence is of presence the statute does not require the judge to submit the case to the jury, nor does it preclude the grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\" The provisions in question both say unqualifiedly that \"presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction\" unless the defendant explains his presence. The Court holds that this statutory command in 5601 (b) (2) is valid,\n4\n but then for some reason adds that judges are free to ignore it or, after telling juries that they may rely on it, are free to set aside the verdicts of those juries which do. In other words, under the Court's holding the judge is left free to take the extraordinary course of following a valid statute or not, as he chooses. Judges are not usually given such unlimited discretion to disregard valid statutes. And as the Court indicates elsewhere in its opinion, it was to prevent judges from setting aside jury verdicts based on presence alone that Congress passed this statute in the first place. Besides being almost self-contradictory, it amounts to an emasculation of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 77]\n\u00a0\n these statutory provisions, I think, to say that the judge was not required to tell the jury about them. But whether or not he was bound to do so, the fact is that here he did, and so this jury deliberated with the judge's solemn instruction that Congress had decided that proof of mere unexplained presence at a still was sufficient to convict Gainey of having illegally possessed it or carried on its business. Few jurors could have failed to believe that it was their duty to convict under this charge if presence was proved, and few judges could have failed to believe it was their duty to uphold such a conviction, even though all of them in a particular case might have felt that mere presence alone was not enough to show guilt.\n\nIt has always been recognized that the guaranty of trial by jury in criminal cases means that the jury is to be the factfinder. This is the only way in which a jury can perform its basic constitutional function of determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 15\n-19; Reid v. Covert, \n354 \nU.S. 1, 5\n-10 (opinion announcing judgment). And of course this constitutionally established power of a jury to determine guilt or innocence of a defendant charged with crime cannot be taken away by Congress, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part. Obviously, a necessary part of this power, vested by the Constitution in juries (or in judges when juries are waived), is the exclusive right to decide whether evidence presented at trial is sufficient to convict. I think it flaunts the constitutional power of courts and juries for Congress to tell them what \"shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction.\" And if Congress could not thus directly encroach upon the judge's or jury's exclusive right to declare what evidence is sufficient to prove the facts necessary for conviction, it should not be allowed to do so merely by labeling its encroachment a \"presumption.\" Neither Tot v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 463\n, relied \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 78]\n\u00a0\n on by the Court as supporting this presumption, nor any case cited in Tot approved such an encroachment on the power of judges or juries. In fact, so far as I can tell, the problem of whether Congress can so restrict the power of court and jury in a criminal case in a federal court has never been squarely presented to or considered by this Court, perhaps because challenges to presumptions have arisen in many crucially different contexts but nevertheless have generally failed to distinguish between presumptions used in different ways, treating them as if they are either all valid or all invalid, regardless of the rights on which their use may impinge. Because the Court also fails to differentiate among the different circumstances in which presumptions may be utilized and the different consequences which will follow, I feel it necessary to say a few words on that subject before considering specifically the validity of the use of these presumptions in the light of the circumstances and consequences of their use.\n\nIn its simplest form a presumption is an inference permitted or required by law of the existence of one fact, which is unknown or which cannot be proved, from another fact which has been proved. The fact presumed may be based on a very strong probability, a weak supposition or an arbitrary assumption. The burden on the party seeking to prove the fact may be slight, as in a civil suit, or very heavy - proof beyond a reasonable doubt - as in a criminal prosecution. This points up the fact that statutes creating presumptions cannot be treated as fungible, that is, as interchangeable for all uses and all purposes. The validity of each presumption must be determined in the light of the particular consequences that flow from its use. When matters of trifling moment are involved, presumptions may be more freely accepted, but when consequences of vital importance to litigants and to the administration of justice are at stake, a more careful scrutiny is necessary. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn judging the constitutionality of legislatively created presumptions this Court has evolved an initial criterion which applies alike to all kinds of presumptions: that before a presumption may be relied on, there must be a rational connection between the facts inferred and the facts which have been proved by competent evidence, that is, the facts proved must be evidence which is relevant, tending to prove (though not necessarily conclusively) the existence of the fact presumed. And courts have undoubtedly shown an inclination to be less strict about the logical strength of presumptive inferences they will permit in civil cases than about those which affect the trial of crimes. The stricter scrutiny in the latter situation follows from the fact that the burden of proof in a civil lawsuit is ordinarily merely a preponderance of the evidence, while in a criminal case where a man's life, liberty, or property is at stake, the prosecution must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Morrison v. California, \n291 \nU.S. 82, 96\n-97. The case of Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219\n, is a good illustration of this principle. There Bailey was accused of violating an Alabama statute which made it a crime to fail to perform personal services after obtaining money by contracting to perform them, with an intent to defraud the employer. The statute also provided that refusal or failure to perform the services, or to refund money paid for them, without just cause, constituted \"prima facie evidence\" (i. e., gave rise to a presumption) of the intent to injure or defraud. This Court, after calling attention to prior cases dealing with the requirement of rationality, passed over the test of rationality and held the statute invalid on another ground. Looking beyond the rational-relationship doctrine the Court held that the use of this presumption by Alabama against a man accused of crime would amount to a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids \"involuntary \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 80]\n\u00a0\n servitude, except as a punishment for crime.\" In so deciding the Court made it crystal clear that rationality is only the first hurdle which a legislatively created presumption must clear - that a presumption, even if rational, cannot be used to convict a man of crime if the effect of using the presumption is to deprive the accused of a constitutional right. In Bailey the constitutional right was given by the Thirteenth Amendment. In the case before us the accused, in my judgment, has been denied his right to the kind of trial by jury guaranteed by Art. III, 2, and the Sixth Amendment, as well as to due process of law and freedom from self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. And of course the principle announced in the Bailey case was not limited to rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment. The Court said in Bailey:\n\n\"It is apparent that a constitutional prohibition cannot be transgressed indirectly by the creation of a statutory presumption any more than it can be violated by direct enactment. The power to create presumptions is not a means of escape from constitutional restrictions.\" \n219 \nU.S., at 239\n.\n\n\n Thus the Court held that presumptions, while often valid (and some of which, I think, like the presumption of death based on long unexplained absence, may perhaps be even salutary in effect), must not be allowed to stand where they abridge or deny a specific constitutional guarantee. It is one thing to rely on a presumption to justify conditional administration of the estate of a person absent without explanation for seven years, see Cunnius v. Reading School District, \n198 \nU.S. 458\n; compare Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34\n; it would be quite another to use the presumption of death from seven years' absence to convict a man of murder. I do not think it can be denied that use of the statutory presumptions in the case before \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 81]\n\u00a0\n us at the very least seriously impaired Gainey's constitutional right to have a jury weigh the facts of his case without any congressional interference through predetermination of what evidence would be sufficient to prove the facts necessary to convict in a particular case.\n\nThe Bailey case also emphatically answers the Court's insistence that this encroachment on Gainey's constitutional rights was justified or neutralized by the trial court's instruction that while evidence of unexplained presence was sufficient under the statute to convict, the jury nonetheless was not compelled to convict. This same kind of contention was made to this Court and rejected in Bailey, where the Alabama Supreme Court had upheld that State's presumption on the ground that \"with such evidence before them, the jury are still left free to find the accused guilty or not guilty, according as they may be satisfied of his guilt or not, by the whole evidence.\" Bailey v. State, 161 Ala. 75, 78, 49 So. 886, 887. This Court answered that contention then, as I think it should now, saying:\n\n\"The point is that, in such a case, the statute authorizes the jury to convict. It is not enough to say that the jury may not accept that evidence as alone sufficient; for the jury may accept it, and they have the express warrant of the statute to accept [it] as a basis for their verdict.\" \n219 \nU.S., at 235\n. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n And the Court added that \"The normal assumption is that the jury will follow the statute and, acting in accordance with the authority it confers, will accept as sufficient what the statute expressly so describes.\" Id., at 237.\n\nEven if I could accept the doctrine that Congress after declaring that certain conduct shall be a crime has further power to tell judges and juries that certain evidence shall be sufficient to prove that conduct and convict \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 82]\n\u00a0\n a defendant, I could not agree that these statutory presumptions are constitutional. They declare mere presence at a still site without more to be sufficient evidence to convict of the crimes of carrying on a distillery business and possessing a still.\n5\n While presence at a still is unquestionably a relevant circumstance to add to others to prove possession or operation of a still, I could not possibly agree that mere presence is sufficient in and of itself, without any supporting evidence, to permit a finding that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person present carried on a distillery business or possessed a still or even aided and abetted in committing those crimes. Indeed, with respect to the crime of possession, as the Court concedes, we held squarely to the contrary in Bozza v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 160\n, quite properly, I think. In setting aside the Bozza conviction for possession of a still, which had been based on mere presence at a still, this Court was acting in accordance with the historic principle that \"independent trial judges and independent appellate judges have a most important place under our constitutional plan since they have power to set aside convictions.\" United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 19\n. This judicial responsibility to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence must be exercised in each case, no more to be controlled by a general congressional enactment than it could be by a special act directed to one case only.\n6\n This protective function of the court is amply demonstrated in the case before us: while Gainey was originally indicted on four counts. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 83]\n\u00a0\n the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on one\n7\n and the Court of Appeals ordered acquittal on another.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIt indeed is true, as the Court suggests, that it was to make convictions possible on no more evidence than presence that the presumption statute here under consideration was passed. Undoubtedly a presumption which can be used to produce convictions without the necessity of proving a crucial element of the crime charged - and a sometimes difficult-to-prove element at that\n9\n - is a boon to prosecutors and an incongruous snare for defendants in a country that claims to require proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Quite accurately such a use of a presumption has been described as \"First Aid to the District Attorney.\"\n10\n Instead of supporting the constitutionality of such a use of statutory presumptions, however, I think this argument based on necessity and convenience points out its fatal defects. I suppose no one would deny that the Government's burden would also be made lighter if the defendant was not represented by counsel, compare Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 \nU.S. 335\n, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 84]\n\u00a0\n or if the jury could receive and consider confessions extorted by torture, compare Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n, or if evidence obtained from defendants through illegal searches and seizures could be used against them, compare Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n, but this Court has not hesitated to strike down such encroachments on those constitutional rights. Yet here the Court sanctions a method less crude, but just as effective, to deny Gainey his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nI cannot subscribe to the idea that any one of the constitutional grants of power to Congress enumerated in Art. I, 8, including the Necessary and Proper Clause, contains either an express or an implied power of Congress to instruct juries as to what evidence is sufficient to convict defendants in particular cases.\n12\n Congress can \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 85]\n\u00a0\n undoubtedly create crimes, but it cannot constitutionally try them. The Constitution specifically prohibits bills of attainder. Congress can declare certain conduct a crime, unless barred by some constitutional provision, but it must, if true to our Constitution of divided powers and the Fifth Amendment's command that cases be tried according to due process of law, leave the trial of those crimes to the courts, in which judges or juries can decide the facts on their own judgment without legislative constraint and judges can set aside convictions which they believe are not justified by the evidence. See Tot v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 463, 473\n (concurring opinion). \"[I]t is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.\" McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n. See Manley v. Georgia, \n279 \nU.S. 1\n. Yet, viewed realistically, that is what the presumption which the Court today approves does in this case. I think that the presumption which should govern instead in criminal trials in the courts of this country is the time-honored presumption of innocence accorded to all criminal defendants until they are proved guilty by competent evidence.\n\nNor can a power of Congress to detract from the constitutional power of juries and judges to decide what facts are enough to convict be implied because of the power of Congress to make procedural rules or rules of evidence. See Ex parte Fisk, \n113 \nU.S. 713, 720\n. It is not disputed that Congress has power to prescribe rules governing admissibility of evidence and purely procedural matters. The Congress unquestionably could declare the fact of presence to be admissible evidence, for certainly it is relevant when considered along with other circumstances. Yet this power to say what shall or shall not be admissible in no way empowers Congress to determine what facts, once admitted, suffice to prove guilt beyond a reasonable \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 86]\n\u00a0\n doubt.\n13\n And I certainly cannot join the Court when it says:\n\n\"The process of making the determination of rationality is, by its nature, highly empirical, and in matters not within specialized judicial competence or completely commonplace, significant weight should be accorded the capacity of Congress to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it.\"\n\n\n The implication of this statement is that somehow Congress is better qualified to decide what facts are sufficient to convict defendants than are courts and juries. I accept the proposition that Congress is the proper branch of our Government to decide legislative policies and enact general laws and that in so doing it must of necessity deal with facts to some extent. This is as the Constitution provides. But Congress is not authorized nor has it any special \"expertise\" with which I am familiar which entitles it to direct juries as to what conclusions they may or must draw from the unique facts of specific criminal cases tried in federal courts. Moreover, even were I to assume that Congress does have an expertise to assess facts in lawsuits which is superior to that of juries and judges, I still could not join the Court's opinion, for I think that the Founders of our Government decided for us that these are matters \"within specialized\" - and exclusive - \"judicial \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 87]\n\u00a0\n competence.\" As this Court has said with reference to jury trial of facts:\n\n\"whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to perform this task.\" United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 18\n.\n\n\n Besides impairing Gainey's right to trial by jury according to due process safeguards, the statutes in this case I think violated Gainey's constitutional rights in still another way. These statutory presumptions must tend, when incorporated into an instruction, as they were here, to influence the jury to reach an inference which the trier of fact might not otherwise have thought justified, to push some jurors to convict who might not otherwise have done so. Cf. Pollock v. Williams, \n322 \nU.S. 4, 15\n. The undoubted practical effect of letting guilt rest on unexplained presence alone is to force a defendant to come forward and testify, however much he may think doing so may jeopardize his chances of acquittal, since if he does not he almost certainly destroys those chances. This is compulsion, which I think runs counter to the Fifth Amendment's purpose to forbid convictions on compelled testimony. The compulsion here is of course more subtle and less cruel physically than compulsion by torture, but it is nonetheless compulsion and it is nonetheless effective. I am aware that this Court in Yee Hem v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 178, 185\n, held that use of a presumptive squeeze like this one did not amount to a form of compulsion forbidden by the Fifth Amendment. The Court's reasoning was contained in a single paragraph, the central argument of which was that despite a presumption like this a defendant is left \"entirely free to testify or not as he chooses.\" That argument, it seems to me, would also justify admitting in evidence a confession \n\n[380 \nU.S. 63, 88]\n\u00a0\n extorted by a policeman's pointing a gun at the head of an accused, on the theory that the man being threatened was entirely free to confess or not, as he chose. I think the holding in Yee Hem is completely out of harmony with the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination, and I would overrule it. See Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487, 494\n (dissenting opinion); compare Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n. See also State v. Lapointe, 81 N. H. 227, 123 A. 692, quoted with approval in the opinion of the court below, 322 F.2d 292, 296 (C. A. 5th Cir.).\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, I think that these two statutory presumptions by which Congress has tried to relieve the Government of its burden of proving a man guilty and to take away from courts and juries the function and duty of deciding guilt or innocence according to the evidence before them, unconstitutionally encroach on the functions of courts and deny persons accused of crime rights which our Constitution guarantees them. The most important and most crucial action the courts take in trying people for crime is to resolve facts. This is a judicial, not a legislative, function. I think that in passing these two sections Congress stepped over its constitutionally limited bounds and encroached on the constitutional power of courts to try cases. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court below and grant Gainey a new trial by judge and jury with all the protections accorded by the law of the land.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (1) (1958 ed.) provides: \"Offenses. \"Any person who - \"(1) Unregistered stills. \"Has in his possession or custody, or under his control, any still or distilling apparatus set up which is not registered, as required by section 5179 (a) . . . .   .  .   .  . \"shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, for each such offense.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (4) (1958 ed.) provides: \"Offenses. \"Any person who - .   .  .   .  . \"(4) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond. \"Carries on the business of a distiller or rectifier without having given bond as required by law . . . .   .  .   .  . \"shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, for each such offense.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 5601 (b) (1) provides: \"(b) Presumptions. \"(1) Unregistered stills. \"Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a) (1) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, a still or distilling apparatus was set up without having been registered, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).\" Section 5601 (b) (2) provides: \"(2) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond. \"Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a) (4) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, the business of a distiller or rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Although the Court does not consider the validity of 5601 (b) (1), its reasoning surely would seem to apply to that section as well.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] I agree with the Court's holding that the language of 5601 (b) (2) \"permits the judge to submit a case to the jury on the basis of the accused's presence alone.\" The Court does not suggest any reason why it would interpret the identical language in 5601 (b) (1) any differently.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Such an act obviously would be proscribed as a bill of attainder, forbidden by Art. I, 9. See United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303\n; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on a count charging Gainey with working in a distillery which did not bear a sign showing the name of the person engaged in the distilling and denoting the business in which he was engaged, an offense made punishable by 26 U.S.C. 5180 (a), 5681 (c) (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Count three of the indictment charged Gainey with carrying on the business of a distiller with intent to defraud the United States of taxes, a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5602 (1958 ed.). The Court of Appeals, holding that the record showed \"no evidence whatever of intent to defraud,\" set aside the jury's verdict of conviction on that count. 322 F.2d 292, 300.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In this case, however, the record shows that there unquestionably was enough other evidence to submit the case to the jury without need for any artificial presumption. But the Court does not suggest that the use here of this presumption either should be or could be called harmless error.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Chamberlain, Presumptions as First Aid to the District Attorney, 14 A. B. A. J. 287.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] \"Once the thumbscrew and the following confession made conviction easy; but that method was crude and, I suppose, now would be declared unlawful upon some ground. Hereafter, presumption is to lighten the burden of the prosecutor. The victim will be spared the trouble of confessing and will go to his cell without mutilation or disquieting outcry.\" Casey v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 413, 420\n (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It might be argued, although the Court does not so argue or hold, that Congress if it wished could make presence at a still a crime in itself, and so Congress should be free to create crimes which are called \"possession\" and \"carrying on an illegal distillery business\" but which are defined in such a way that unexplained presence is sufficient and indisputable evidence in all cases to support conviction for those offenses. See Ferry v. Ramsey, \n277 \nU.S. 88\n. Assuming for the sake of argument that Congress could make unexplained presence a criminal act, and ignoring also the refusal of this Court in other cases to uphold a statutory presumption on such a theory, see Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312\n, there is no indication here that Congress intended to adopt such a misleading method of draftsmanship, nor in my judgment could the statutory provisions if so construed escape condemnation for vagueness, under the principles applied in Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n, and many other cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] \"While it is within the province of the legislature to determine the sources of evidence, the modes of verification, who may or may not be competent witnesses, I am not prepared to say they may weigh and determine the quantity of evidence, which shall suffice to produce conviction in the mind of the judge or juror who tries a cause.\" Thomas, J., dissenting in Commonwealth v.

MIDLAND-ROSS CORP.(1965)\nNo. 628\nArgued: March 31, 1965Decided: May 3, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondent taxpayer in 1952-1954 bought noninterest-bearing promissory notes at prices discounted below the face amounts and held them over six months. Before maturity and in the year of purchase it sold each below the face amount but for more than the issue price. The gains, concededly the economic equivalent of interest, were reported as capital gains. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the gains attributable to original issue discount were but interest in another form and therefore taxable as ordinary income. After paying the deficiencies respondent brought this refund action which both the District Court and the Court of Appeals decided in its favor. Held: Earned original issue discount is not entitled to capital gains treatment under the 1939 Internal Revenue Code. Pp. 56-67.\n\n (a) Although capital gains treatment is to be accorded to the sale of a \"capital asset,\" defined in 117 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as \"property\" held by the taxpayer, the term \"capital asset\" is to be construed narrowly so as to apply only where there has been realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time. Pp. 56-57.\n\n\n (b) \"Capital asset\" does not include an item like earned original issue discount, which serves the same function as stated interest, the earning of which is predictable and does not represent market appreciation. Pp. 57-58.\n\n\n (c) In specifying ordinary income treatment for original issue discount in 1232 (a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and in special provisions of the 1939 Code Congress did not indicate any understanding that such discount would be entitled to capital gains treatment in the absence of such provisions. Pp. 58-63.\n\n\n (d) A case in which the Tax Court allowed capital gains treatment of the full amount the taxpayer received upon retirement of an \"Accumulative Installment Certificate\" - Caulkins v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 656, acq. 1944 Cum. Bull. 5, aff'd, 144 F.2d 482 (C. A. 6th Cir.), acq. withdrawn, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 7 - did not \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 55]\n\u00a0\n unambiguously establish that original issue discount was itself a \"capital asset\" entitled to capital gains treatment, and what little other administrative practice dealt with the question appears contrary to its holding.

Goodman argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, Wayne G. Barnett and Joseph Kovner.\n\nTheodore R. Colborn argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Theodore M. Garver.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question for decision is whether, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, certain gains realized by the taxpayer are taxable as capital gains or as ordinary income. The taxpayer bought noninterest-bearing promissory notes from the issuers at prices discounted below the face amounts. With one exception, each of the notes was held for more than six months, and, before maturity and in the year of purchase, was sold for less than its face amount but more than its issue price.\n1\n It is conceded that the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n gain in each case was the economic equivalent of interest for the use of the money to the date of sale but the taxpayer reported the gains as capital gains. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the gains attributable to original issue discount were but interest in another form and therefore were taxable as ordinary income. Respondent paid the resulting deficiencies and in this suit for refund prevailed in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, 214 F. Supp. 631, and in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 335 F.2d 561. Because this treatment as capital gains conflicts with the result reached by other courts of appeals,\n2\n we granted certiorari. \n379 \nU.S. 944\n. We reverse.\n\nThe more favorable capital gains treatment applied only to gain on \"the sale or exchange of a capital asset.\" 117 (a) (4). Although original issue discount becomes property when the obligation falls due or is liquidated prior to maturity and 117 (a) (1) defined a capital asset as \"property held by the taxpayer,\"\n3\n we have held that\n\n\"not everything which can be called property in the ordinary sense and which is outside the statutory exclusions qualifies as a capital asset. This Court has long held that the term `capital asset' is to be construed narrowly in accordance with the purpose \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 57]\n\u00a0\n of Congress to afford capital-gains treatment only in situations typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time, and thus to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.\" Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Co., \n364 \nU.S. 130, 134\n.\n\n\n See also Corn Products Co. v. Commissioner, \n350 \nU.S. 46, 52\n. In applying this principle, this Court has consistently construed \"capital asset\" to exclude property representing income items or accretions to the value of a capital asset themselves properly attributable to income. Thus the Court has held that \"capital asset\" does not include compensation awarded a taxpayer as representing the fair rental value of its facilities during the period of their operation under government control. Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Co., supra; the amount of the proceeds of the sale of an orange grove attributable to the value of an unmatured annual crop, Watson v. Commissioner, \n345 \nU.S. 544\n; an unexpired lease. Hort v. Commissioner, \n313 \nU.S. 28\n; and oil payment rights, Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 260\n. Similarly, earned original issue discount cannot be regarded as \"typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time . . . [given capital gains treatment] to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.\"\n\nEarned original issue discount serves the same function as stated interest, concededly ordinary income and not a capital asset; it is simply \"compensation for the use or forbearance of money.\" Deputy v. du Pont, \n308 \nU.S. 488, 498\n; cf. Lubin v. Commissioner, 335 F.2d 209 (C. A. 2d Cir.). Unlike the typical case of capital appreciation, the earning of discount to maturity is predictable and measurable, and is \"essentially a substitute for . . . payments which 22 (a) expressly characterizes as gross income [; thus] it must be regarded as ordinary income, and \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 58]\n\u00a0\n it is immaterial that for some purposes the contract creating the right to such payments may be treated as `property' or `capital.'\" Hort v. Commissioner, supra, at 31. The $6 earned on a one-year note for $106 issued for $100 is precisely like the $6 earned on a one-year loan of $100 at 6% stated interest. The application of general principles would indicate, therefore, that earned original issue discount, like stated interest, should be taxed under 22 (a) as ordinary income.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe taxpayer argues, however, that administrative practice and congressional treatment of original issue discount under the 1939 Code establish that such discount is to be accounted for as capital gain when realized. Section 1232 (a) (2) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954\n5\n provides that \"upon sale or exchange of . . . evidences \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 59]\n\u00a0\n of indebtedness issued after December 31, 1954, held by the taxpayer more than 6 months, any gain realized . . . [up to the prorated amount of original issue discount] shall be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is not a capital asset,\" that is, it is to be taxed at ordinary income rates. From this the taxpayer would infer that Congress understood prior administrative and legislative history as extending capital gains treatment to realized original issue discount. If administrative practice and legislative history before 1954 did in fact ignore economic reality and treat stated interest and original issue discount differently for tax purposes. the taxpayer should prevail. See Hanover Bank v. Commissioner, \n369 \nU.S. 672\n; Deputy v. du Pont, supra; cf. Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n. But the taxpayer must persuade us that this was clearly the case, see Watson v. Commissioner, supra, at 551, and has not done so.\n\nThe taxpayer refers us to various statutory provisions treating original issue discount as ordinary income in specific situations, arguing that these establish a congressional understanding that in situations not covered by such provisions, original issue discount is entitled to capital \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 60]\n\u00a0\n gains treatment. Even if these provisions were merely limited applications of the principle of 1232 (a) (2), they may demonstrate, not that the general rule was to the contrary, but that the general rule was unclear, see Brandis, Effect of Discount or Premium on Bondholder's North Carolina Income Tax, 19 N.C. L. Rev. 1, 7 (1940), and that Congress wished to avoid any doubt as to its treatment of particular situations. Cf. S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 112 (1954).\n\nFirst we are referred to 42 (b) and 42 (c) of the 1939 Code.\n6\n Section 42 (b) applied, inter alia, to discounted noninterest-bearing obligations periodically redeemable for specified increasing amounts, and permitted \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 61]\n\u00a0\n cash-basis taxpayers an election to accrue the annual increase. If anything, the statutory language supports the Government's position, for it implies that an accrual-basis taxpayer has no election, but must accrue the increases; this seems to indicate a congressional understanding that such increases were ordinary income. Section 42 (c) postpones recognition of discount on short-term government obligations until maturity or sale. That provision, however, has its own history. Earlier law, requiring the proration of original issue discount according to the time the obligation was held, was considered to \"impose on taxpayers the duty of making burdensome computations.\" See S. Rep. No. 673, Part 1, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 30 (1941). The proration provisions had in turn succeeded a statute enacted, not to make an exception to a general rule of capital gains treatment for issue discount, but to insure that the then-existing exemption for discount as representing interest could be claimed by taxpayers other than the original holder. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 17, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2 (1929). Since the tax exemption for Treasury paper was eliminated in 1941, there was no longer any important reason to distinguish exempt original issue discount from nonexempt market discount, and 42 (c) was enacted expressly to simplify administration by eliminating the necessity for allocation between interest and capital gain or loss, and treating all discount as income, but taxable only on realization.\n7\n If \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 62]\n\u00a0\n the inferences drawn by respondent were correct, these provisions would be rendered superfluous by the enactment of 1232 (a) (2), but they have been carried forward as 454 (a) and (b) of the 1954 Code.\n\nIt is also argued that 201 (e) and 207 (d) of the 1939 Code\n8\n manifested a congressional view opposed to ordinary income treatment. These sections required annual accrual of bond premium and discount by life and mutual casualty insurance companies. But again, somewhat like 42 (b), these provisions provided for accrual by cash-basis taxpayers. See Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 269\n. Moreover, the Commissioner \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 63]\n\u00a0\n had interpreted these provisions as requiring him to treat market discounts or premiums, as well as interest agreed upon by the borrower in the guise of original issue discount, as ordinary income items.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThus, the taxpayer has not demonstrated that, in specifying ordinary income treatment for original issue discount in particular situations. Congress evinced its understanding that such discount would otherwise be entitled to capital gains treatment. Therefore we turn to the question whether Treasury practice and decisional law preclude ordinary income treatment.\n\nThe taxpayer premises this part of his argument primarily upon the case of Caulkins v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 656, acq., 1944 Cum. Bull. 5. aff'd, 144 F.2d 482 (C. A. 6th Cir.), acq. withdrawn, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 7.\n10\n The taxpayer there purchased an \"Accumulative Installment Certificate\" providing for 10 annual payments of $1,500 in return for $20,000 at the end of 10 years. The certificate provided for gradually increasing cash surrender and loan values. In 1939 the taxpayer received $20,000 as agreed and, relying on the long-term capital gains provisions of the Revenue Act of 1938, c. 289, 52 Stat. 447, reported only half the profit as taxable income. Acting primarily on the theory that the certificate was not in registered form as required by 117 (f), the Commissioner sought to treat the increment as interest or as income arising out of a transaction entered into for profit. The Tax Court upheld the taxpayer, finding that the certificate was in \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 64]\n\u00a0\n registered form within the meaning of 117 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1938, a provision identical to 117 (f) of the 1939 Code,\n11\n but its discussion of the capital gains question is at best opaque.\n12\n The Court of Appeals acknowledged that \"the transaction presents no true aspect of capital gain\" and that \"Congress might well have made the differentiation urged by the Commissioner, since it is difficult to perceive any practical reason for taxing increment of the type involved here differently from ordinary income . . . [as] consideration paid for the use \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 65]\n\u00a0\n of the amounts paid in. . . .\" 144 F.2d, at 484. Nevertheless it construed the words \"amounts received by the holder upon . . . retirement\" in 117 (f) as unsusceptible of partition, and therefore as including the increment attributable to interest, which, with the principal amount, was thus taxable only as capital gain.\n\nCaulkins did not unambiguously establish that original issue discount was itself a \"capital asset\" entitled to capital gains treatment. It held only that under 117 (f) Congress had not provided that the \"amount\" received on retirement might be broken down into its component parts. This was inconsistent with the view expressed in Williams v. McGowan, 152 F.2d 570 (C. A. 2d Cir.). and approved by this Court in Watson v. Commissioner, supra, at 552, that \"Congress plainly did mean to comminute the elements of a business; plainly it did not regard the whole as `capital assets.'\" 152 F.2d, at 572. The Tax Court has consistently regarded Caulkins as having erroneously read 117 (f) to preclude differentiation of the sources of proceeds on redemption. Paine v. Commissioner, 23 T. C. 391, 401, reversed on other grounds, 236 F.2d 398 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Stanton v. Commissioner, 34 T. C. 1; see 3B Mertens, The Law of Federal Income Taxation 184-186, 378-381 (Zimet rev.). The Commissioner, in addition to withdrawing his acquiescence in Caulkins, has also rejected the interpretation of \"amount\" under 117 (f) as not subject to apportionment under general principles. Rev. Rul. 119, 1953-2 Cum. Bull. 95; Rev. Rul. 55-136, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 213; Rev. Rul. 56-299, 1956-1 Cum. Bull. 603. To the extent the Tax Court's decision in Caulkins rested, as its opinion indicates, on a reading of 117 (f) to require more favorable treatment on redemption than on sale, it is clearly at odds with the legislative purpose, which was merely to treat alike redemptions and sales or exchanges of securities in registered form or with coupons attached, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 66]\n\u00a0\n and not to extend the class of capital assets. Rev. Rul. 56-299, supra. Such an interpretation, which would not benefit the taxpayer in the sale transactions here involved, may underlie the Tax Court's decision but it has no justification in logic or in the legislative history, and even the taxpayer would reject such a meaning, however well supported by the Caulkins acquiescence. Finally, notwithstanding the acquiescence, what little other administrative practice we are referred to seems contrary to Caulkins. See I. T. 1684, II-1 Cum. Bull. 60 (1923).\n\nThe concept of discount or premium as altering the effective rate of interest is not to be rejected as an \"esoteric concept derived from subtle and theoretic analysis.\" Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 561\n. For, despite some expressions indicating a contrary view.\n13\n this Court has often recognized the economic function of discount as interest. In Old Mission Co. v. Helvering. \n293 \nU.S. 289, 290\n, for example, the Court regarded it as \"no longer open to question that amortized bond discount may be deducted in the separate return of a single taxpayer.\"\n14\n The radical changes since Caulkins in the concept of treatment of accumulated interest under the 1939 Code are consistent with this. For example, accrued bond interest on stated interest bonds sold between interest dates has long been taxable to the seller of the bonds. See I. T. 3175, 1938-1 Cum. Bull. 200. But on \"flat\" sales of defaulted notes at prices in excess of face \n\n[381 \nU.S. 54, 67]\n\u00a0\n amount, with no attribution of interest arrearages in the sale price, the requirement of allocation to treat a portion of the proceeds as ordinary income dates only from 1954. Fisher v. Commissioner, 209 F.2d 513 (C. A. 6th Cir.); see Jaglom v. Commissioner, 303 F.2d 847 (C. A. 2d Cir.). The propriety of such allocation in the present case is even more evident; unlike defaulted bond interest. there is no suggestion that full payment of the original issue discount will not be made at maturity.\n\nFor these reasons we hold that earned original issue discount is not entitled to capital gains treatment under the 1939 Code.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The original plaintiff, Industrial Rayon Corporation, was merged into respondent Midland-Ross Corporation in 1961. During 1952, 1953, and 1954, Industrial's idle funds were used to purchase 13 non-interest-bearing notes, varying in face amount from $500,000 to $2,000,000, from General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Commercial Investment Trust Company and Commercial Credit Company. The original issue discount in most instances was calculated to yield the equivalent of 2% to 2 1\/2% on an annual basis if the note were held to maturity, and the gains on sale approximated the discount earned to date. It is not contended that any part of the gain was attributable to market fluctuations as opposed to the passage of time.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Real Estate Investment Trust of America v.

At the same time, short-term government paper was excluded from the definition of \"capital asset\" in 117 (a) (1) (D) of the 1939 Code, avoiding the necessity of separating out the amount of proceeds attributable to market fluctuations rather than earned discount.

MISSISSIPPI(1965)\nNo. 73\nArgued: January 26, 1965Decided: March 8, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Charging that appellees, the State of Mississippi, the Election Commissioners, and six voting registrars of that State were destroying the right of Mississippi Negroes to vote, the United States brought this action for relief under 42 U.S.C. 1971 (d) and other provisions. The complaint alleged a long-standing, carefully executed plan to keep Negroes in Mississippi from voting. It stated that in 1890, in order to restrict the Negro franchise, a new constitution was adopted, 244 of which established as a voting prerequisite reading, understanding, or giving a reasonable interpretation of a section of the state constitution; that this provision, when coupled with Negro ineligibility until about 1952 to vote in the decisive Democratic primary election, within nine years reduced the percentage of qualified voters who were Negroes from over 50% to about 9% and by 1954 only about 5% of Negroes of voting age were registered; that in 1954, 244 was amended to make all of its previously alternative requirements apply and to make an applicant additionally demonstrate \"a reasonable understanding of the duties and obligations of citizenship,\" a requirement which registrars allegedly have applied in a racially discriminatory manner; that in 1960 two discriminatory voting statutes were adopted, one imposing a \"good moral character\" qualification, and the other (contrary to federal law) permitting destruction of some voting records; and that in 1962 a \"package\" of legislation was enacted further to impede Negro voting registration. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, held that the Election Commissioners were not proper parties, that the registrars could not be sued jointly, and that venue was improper as to some. Held:\n\n 1. Section 1971 (a) of Title 42 U.S.C. guarantees the right of citizens \"who are otherwise qualified by law\" to vote at any election without racial distinction, and subsection (c) authorizes the Attorney General to sue for preventive relief to protect that right regardless of whether it is threatened by invalid laws or valid laws discriminatorily applied. Pp. 136-138. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 2. Section 1971 (c) authorizes the Attorney General to make the State a defendant whether or not the office of registrar is vacant. Pp. 138-141.\n\n\n 3. Since under state law the Election Commissioners have the duty to help administer the voter registration laws by formulating rules for tests applied to applicants, the Commissioners were properly named as defendants. Pp. 141-142.\n\n\n 4. The registrars, who were charged with taking part in a state-wide scheme to keep Negroes from voting for racial reasons, were properly joined as defendants in one suit, Rule 20 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure providing for joinder where there is asserted a right to relief arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions and where any question of law or fact common to all will arise in the action; and therefore the venue as to those outside the district and division where the District Court sat was properly laid under 28 U.S.C. 1392 (a) and 1393 (b). Pp. 142-143.\n\n\n 5. The complaint charging that the State of Mississippi and its officials for over three quarters of a century had enacted and enforced constitutional provisions, statutes, rules and regulations, and engaged in discriminatory practices, to keep the number of white voters as high and the number of Negro voters as low as possible, stated a cause of action and it was error to dismiss the complaint without trial. Pp. 143-144.\n\n\n 229 F. Supp. 925, reversed and remanded.\n\nSolicitor General Cox argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney General Marshall, Louis F.

With him on the briefs were Joe T. Patterson, Attorney General of Mississippi, Dugas Shands, Assistant Attorney General. P. M.

Wulf filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe United States by the Attorney General brought this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Jackson Division, against the State of Mississippi, the three members of the Mississippi State Board of Election Commissioners, and six county Registrars of Voters. The complaint charged that the defendants and their agents had engaged and, unless restrained, would continue to engage in acts and practices hampering and destroying the right of Negro citizens of Mississippi to vote, in violation of 42 U.S.C. 1971 (a) (1958 ed.), and of the Fourteenth\n1\n and Fifteenth\n2\n Amendments and Article I of the United States Constitution. Jurisdiction of the Court was invoked under 42 U.S.C. 1971 (d) (1958 ed.) and 28 U.S.C. 1345 (1958 ed.), and because the complaint charged that provisions of the state constitution and statutes pertaining to voter registration violated the United States Constitution, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n the case was heard by three judges, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 (1958 ed.). All the defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. In addition the State moved separately to dismiss on the ground that the United States had no power to make it a defendant in such a suit, and the three Election Commissioners answered that the complaint failed to show that they had enforced or that they had a duty to enforce the provisions of state law alleged to be unconstitutional. Five of the registrars moved for a severance and separate trials, and the four who were not residents of the Southern District of Mississippi, Jackson Division, moved for changes of venue to the respective districts and divisions where they lived. The District Court in an opinion by the late Circuit Judge Cameron, in which District Judge Cox joined,\n3\n dismissed the complaint on all the grounds which the defendants had assigned and also ruled that the registrars could not be sued jointly and that venue was improper as to the registrars who did not live in the district and division in which the court was sitting. 229 F. Supp. 925. Circuit Judge Brown dissented. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n377 \nU.S. 988\n, and set the case down for argument immediately preceding Louisiana v. United States, post, p. 145.\n\nThe basic issue before us in this case is whether the dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was proper. The United States alleges that in 1890 a majority of the qualified voters in Mississippi were Negroes, but that in that year a constitutional convention adopted a new state constitution, one of the chief purposes of which was, in the words of the complaint, to \"restrict the Negro franchise and to establish and perpetuate white political supremacy and racial segregation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n in Mississippi.\" Section 244 of that constitution established a new prerequisite for voting: that a person otherwise qualified be able to read any section of the Mississippi Constitution, or understand the same when read to him, or give a reasonable interpretation thereof.\n4\n This new requirement, coupled with the fact that until about 1952 Negroes were not eligible to vote in the primary election of the Democratic Party, victory in which was \"tantamount to election,\" worked so well in keeping Negroes from voting, the complaint charges, that by 1899 the percentage of qualified voters in the State who were Negroes had declined from over 50% to about 9%, and by 1954 only about 5% of the Negroes of voting age in Mississippi were registered.\n\nBy the 1950's a much higher proportion of Negroes of voting age in Mississippi was literate than had been the case in 1890, and since a decision of the Fifth Circuit in 1951\n5\n had pointed out that the 1890 requirement allowed persons to vote if they met any one of the three alternative requirements, the State took steps to multiply the barriers keeping its Negro citizens from voting. In 1954 the state constitution was amended to provide that thereafter an applicant for registration had to be able to read and copy in writing any section of the Mississippi Constitution, and give a reasonable interpretation of that section to the county registrar, and, in addition, demonstrate to the registrar \"a reasonable understanding \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n of the duties and obligations of citizenship under a constitutional form of government.\"\n6\n The complaint charges that these provisions lend themselves to misuse and to discriminatory administration because they leave the registrars completely at large, free to be as demanding or as lenient as they choose in judging an applicant's understanding of the state constitution and of the \"duties and obligations of citizenship,\" and that since the adoption of this amendment the registrars have in fact applied standards which varied in difficulty according to whether an applicant was white or colored.\n\nIn 1960 the state constitution was amended to add a new voting qualification of \"good moral character,\"\n7\n an addition which it is charged was to serve as yet another device to give a registrar power to permit an applicant to vote or not, depending solely on the registrar's own whim or caprice, ungoverned by any legal standard. A statute also passed in 1960\n8\n repealed a prior Mississippi statute which had provided that application forms be retained as permanent public records, and adopted a new rule that unless appeal is taken from an adverse ruling and no new application is made prior to final judgment on that \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 134]\n\u00a0\n appeal, registrars no longer need keep any record made in connection with the application of anyone to register to vote. This law is alleged to be in direct violation of Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which requires that records of voting registration be kept.\n9\n The complaint alleged further that the defendants had destroyed and unless restrained by the court would continue to destroy these records. Finally, it was alleged that in 1962 the Mississippi Legislature adopted a package of legislation\n10\n affecting registration, the purpose and effect of which was to \"deter, hinder, prevent, delay and harass Negroes and to make it more difficult for Negroes in their efforts to become registered voters, to facilitate discrimination against Negroes, and to make it more difficult for the United States to protect the right of all its citizens to vote without distinction of race or color.\" These 1962 laws provide, among other things, that application forms must be filled out \"properly and responsively\" by the applicant without any assistance, and that a registrar may not tell an applicant why he failed the test because \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 135]\n\u00a0\n to do so might constitute assistance, and they allegedly give registrars even greater discretion to deny Negroes the right to register on formal, technical, inconsequential errors.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nBy way of relief the court was asked (1) to declare the challenged state laws unconstitutional as violations of federal constitutional provisions and statutes; (2) to find that by these laws Negroes had been denied the right to vote pursuant to a \"pattern and practice\" of racial discrimination;\n12\n (3) to enjoin the defendants from enforcing any of these state laws or in any other way acting to \"delay, prevent, hinder, discourage, or harass Negro citizens, on account of their race or color, from applying for registration and becoming registered voters in the State of Mississippi,\" or using any other interpretation or understanding test which \"bears a direct relationship to the quality of public education afforded Negro applicants\"; and (4) to order the defendants to register any Negro applicant who is over age 21, able to read, a resident for the period of time prescribed by state law, and not disqualified by state laws disfranchising the insane and certain convicted criminals.\n\nIt is apparent that the complaint which the majority of the District Court dismissed charged a long-standing, carefully prepared, and faithfully observed plan to bar Negroes from voting in the State of Mississippi, a plan which the registration statistics included in the complaint \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 136]\n\u00a0\n would seem to show had been remarkably successful. This brings us to a consideration of the specific grounds assigned by the District Court for its dismissal.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nOne ground upon which the majority of the District Court dismissed the Government's complaint was that the United States is without authority, absent the clearest possible congressional authorization, to bring an action like this one which challenges the validity of state laws allegedly used as devices to keep Negroes from voting on account of their race. We need not discuss the power of the United States to bring such an action without authorization by Congress, for in 42 U.S.C. 1971 (1958 ed.) there is express congressional authorization for the United States to file a suit precisely of this kind. Section 1971 (a) guarantees the right of citizens \"who are otherwise qualified by law to vote at any election\" to be allowed to vote \"without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; any constitution, law, custom, usage, or regulation of any State or Territory, or by or under its authority, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\n13\n And subsection (c) of 1971 specifically authorizes the Attorney General to file proper proceedings for preventive relief to protect this right to vote without discrimination on account of color whenever any person has engaged or there are reasonable grounds to believe that any person is about to engage in any act or practice which would \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 137]\n\u00a0\n deprive any other person of that right.\n14\n The District Court's holding that despite the clear language quoted above the United States still was not authorized to file this suit seems to rest on the emphasis it places on the phrase \"otherwise qualified by law\" in 1971 (a). By stressing these words the majority below reached the conclusion that if Negroes were kept from voting by state laws, even though those laws were unconstitutional, instead of being barred by unlawful discriminatory application of laws otherwise valid, then they were not \"otherwise qualified\" and so 1971 did not apply to them. In other words, while private persons might file suits under 1971 against individual registrars who discriminated in applying otherwise valid laws, and while such suits might even be filed by the Government, see United States v. Raines, \n362 \nU.S. 17\n, the statute did not authorize the United States to bring suits challenging the validity of the State's voting laws as such, however discriminatory they might be. We can find no possible justification for \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 138]\n\u00a0\n such a construction of 1971 (a) and 1971 (c). Subsection (a) explicitly stated the legislative purpose of protecting the rights of colored citizens to vote notwithstanding \"any constitution, law, custom, usage, or regulation of any State.\" The phrase \"otherwise qualified by law to vote\" obviously meant that Negroes must possess the qualifications required of all voters by valid state or federal laws. It is difficult to take seriously the argument that Congress intended to dilute its guarantee of the right to vote regardless of race by saying at the same time that a State was free to disqualify its Negro citizens by laws which violated the United States Constitution. Cf. Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n. The Fifteenth Amendment protects the right to vote regardless of race against any denial or abridgment by the United States or by any State. Section 1971 was passed by Congress under the authority of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment's guarantee, which protects against any discrimination by a State, its laws, its customs, or its officials in any way. We reject the argument that the Attorney General was without power to institute these proceedings in order to protect the federally guaranteed right to vote without discrimination on account of color.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe District Court held, and it is contended here, that even if the Attorney General did have power to file this suit on behalf of the United States, as we have held he did, nevertheless he was without power to make the State a party defendant. The District Court gave great weight to Mississippi's argument that the Fifteenth Amendment \"is directed to persons through whom a state may act and not to the sovereign entity of the state itself.\" 229 F. Supp., at 933. Largely to avoid what it called this \"substantial constitutional claim,\" the District Court proceeded to construe the language of 1971 as not granting \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 139]\n\u00a0\n the Attorney General authority to make the State a defendant. We do not agree with that construction.\n\nSection 1971 (c) says that whenever the Attorney General institutes a suit under this section against a state official who has deprived a citizen of his right to vote because of race or color,\n\n\"the act or practice shall also be deemed that of the State and the State may be joined as a party defendant and, if, prior to the institution of such proceeding, such official has resigned or has been relieved of his office and no successor has assumed such office, the proceeding may be instituted against the State.\"\n\n\n The District Court accepted the State's argument that this meant that a State can be made a defendant in such a case only when the office of registrar is vacant, so that there is no registrar against whom to file suit. This argument relies on the fact that in a case pending in this Court when the statutory language was changed, registrars had resigned their offices in order to keep from being sued under 1971. United States v. Alabama, 267 F.2d 808 (C. A. 5th Cir.), vacated and remanded, \n362 \nU.S. 602\n. Congress, the State says, passed the provision authorizing suit against a State solely to provide a party defendant when registrars resigned, as they had in the Alabama case. But whatever the reasons Congress had for amending 1971 (c), and without our now deciding whether it was necessary to do so to permit the United States to sue a State under that section, the language Congress adopted leaves no room for the construction which the District Court put on these provisions. Indeed, on remand in the Alabama case the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's refusal to dismiss the State as a defendant even though new registrars had qualified, and this Court affirmed that judgment. Alabama v. United States, \n371 \nU.S. 37\n, affirming 304 F.2d 583 (C. A. 5th Cir.). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe State argues also that even if Congress has authorized making the State a defendant here, as we hold it has, Congress had no constitutional power to do so. The Fifteenth Amendment in plain, unambiguous language provides that no \"State\" shall deny or abridge the right of citizens to vote because of their color. In authorizing the United States to make a State a defendant in a suit under 1971, Congress was acting under its power given in 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment by appropriate legislation. The State's argument that Congress acted here beyond its constitutional power is based on a number of cases that have allowed private individuals to enjoin state officials from denying constitutional rights, while recognizing that without its consent a State could not be sued by private persons in such circumstances, because of the immunity given the State in the Eleventh Amendment. See, e. g., Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n. But none of these cases decided or even suggested that Congress could not authorize the United States to institute legal proceedings against States to protect constitutional rights of citizens. The Eleventh Amendment in terms forbids suits against States only when \"commenced or prosecuted . . . by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" While this has been read to bar a suit by a State's own citizen as well, Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1\n, nothing in this or any other provision of the Constitution prevents or has ever been seriously supposed to prevent a State's being sued by the United States. The United States in the past has in many cases been allowed to file suits in this and other courts against States, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621\n; United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175\n, with or without specific authorization from Congress, see United States v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 19, 26\n-28. See also Parden v. Terminal R. Co., \n377 \nU.S. 184\n. In light of this history, it seems rather surprising \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 141]\n\u00a0\n that the District Court entertained seriously the argument that the United States could not constitutionally sue a State. The reading of the Constitution urged by Mississippi is not supported by precedent, is not required by any language of the Constitution, and would without justification in reason diminish the power of courts to protect the people of this country against deprivation and destruction by States of their federally guaranteed rights. We hold that the State was properly made a defendant in this case.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe District Court held with respect to the three members of the Mississippi Board of Election Commissioners that the complaint failed to show that they had a sufficient interest in administering or enforcing the laws under attack to permit making them parties defendant. We do not agree. Under state law the Election Commissioners have power, authority, and responsibility to help administer the voter registration laws by formulating rules for the various tests applied to applicants for registration. Section 3209.6 of the Mississippi Code directs that the forms and the questions on the forms shall be prepared and maintained under the supervision of the Election Board and that these application forms shall be\n\n\"designed to test the ability of applicants for registration to vote to read and write any section of the Constitution of this state and give a reasonable interpretation thereof, and demonstrate to the county registrar a reasonable understanding of the duties and obligations of citizenship under a constitutional form of government; and to demonstrate to the county registrar that applicant is a person of good moral character as required by Section 241-A of the Constitution of Mississippi.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 142]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n These \"interpretation\" and \"duties and obligations of citizenship\" tests, as has been pointed out, are vitally important elements of the Mississippi laws challenged as unconstitutional in this suit. Should the Government prove its case and obtain an injunction, it would be natural to assume that such an order should run against the Board of Election Commissioners with reference to these two tests. Therefore the Election Commissioners should not have been stricken as defendants.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe District Court said that the complaint improperly attempted to hold the six county registrars jointly liable for what amounted to nothing more than individual torts committed by them separately with reference to separate applicants. For this reason apparently it would have held the venue improper as to the three registrars who lived outside the Southern District of Mississippi and a fourth who lived in a different division of the Southern District, and it would have ordered that each of the other two registrars be sued alone. But the complaint charged that the registrars had acted and were continuing to act as part of a state-wide system designed to enforce the registration laws in a way that would inevitably deprive colored people of the right to vote solely because of their color. On such an allegation the joinder of all the registrars as defendants in a single suit is authorized by Rule 20 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides:\n\n\". . . All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n These registrars were alleged to be carrying on activities which were part of a series of transactions or occurrences the validity of which depended to a large extent upon \"question[s] of law or fact common to all of them.\" Since joinder of the registrars in one suit was proper, the argument that venue as to some of them was not properly laid is also without merit. 28 U.S.C. 1392 (a), 1393 (b) (1958 ed.).\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nAs a general ground for dismissal, the District Court held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. In considering the correctness of this ruling the allegations of the complaint are to be taken as true, and indeed the record contains answers to pretrial interrogatories which indicate that the United States stands ready to produce much evidence tending to prove the truthfulness of all the allegations in the complaint. While the Government has argued that several provisions of the Mississippi laws challenged here might or should be held unconstitutional on their face without introduction of evidence or further hearings, with respect to all the others the Solicitor General in this Court specifically has declined to \"urge that the constitutionality of these provisions be decided prior to trial.\" In this situation we have decided that it is the more appropriate course to pass only upon the sufficiency of the complaint's allegations to justify relief if proved.\n\nWe have no doubt whatsoever that it was error to dismiss the complaint without a trial. The complaint charged that the State of Mississippi and its officials for the past three quarters of a century have been writing and adopting constitutional provisions, statutes, rules, and regulations, and have been engaging in discriminatory practices, all designed to keep the number of white voters at the highest possible figure and the number of colored voters at the lowest. It alleged that the common purpose \n\n[380 \nU.S. 128, 144]\n\u00a0\n running through the State's legal and administrative history during that time has been to adopt whatever expedient seemed necessary to establish white political supremacy in a completely segregated society. This purpose, indeed, was recognized by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1896 when it said, speaking of the convention which adopted the 1890 constitution:\n\n\"Within the field of permissible action under the limitations imposed by the federal constitution, the convention swept the circle of expedients to obstruct the exercise of the franchise by the negro race.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n The success of the expedients adopted in 1890 and in later years to accomplish this purpose appears from statistics in the complaint. For example, the complaint states that at the time the suit was filed Amite County, Mississippi, the registrar of which was one of the defendants here, had a white voting age population of 4,449 with white registration of 3,295, while it had 2,560 colored persons of voting age, of whom only one was a registered voter. There is no need to multiply examples. The allegations of this complaint were too serious, the right to vote in this country is too precious, and the necessity of settling grievances peacefully in the courts is too important for this complaint to have been dismissed. Compare Davis v. Schnell, 81 F. Supp. 872 (D.C. S. D. Ala.), aff'd, \n336 \nU.S. 933\n; Louisiana v. United States, post, p. 145, this day decided. The case should have been tried. It should now be tried without delay.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN considers that the constitutional conclusions reached in this opinion can properly be based only on the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment. In all other respects, he fully subscribes to this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States Constitution, Amendment XIV, provides in part: \"SECTION 1.

ROMANO(1965)\nNo. 2090\nArgued: October 14, 1965Decided: November 22, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Respondents, who were found by federal officers near an operating still, were indicted on three counts charging, in Count 1, the possession, custody and control of an illegal still in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (1); in Count 2, the illegal production of distilled spirits in violation of 5601 (a) (8); and, in Count 3, a conspiracy to produce distilled spirits. Respondents were convicted and given concurrent prison sentences on each count and fined on Count 1. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conspiracy convictions but reversed the substantive convictions, holding invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment an instruction and statutory inference embodied therein based on 5601 (b) (1) and (4), which provide in part that presence of a defendant at an illegal still site shall be sufficient evidence to authorize conviction under 5601 (a) (1) and (8) unless he explains such presence to the jury's satisfaction. Held:\n\n 1. It is unnecessary to consider the validity of 5601 (b) (4) and the convictions under Count 2 since the sentences thereon were concurrent with the unchallenged sentences imposed on Count 3. P. 138.\n\n\n 2. The statutory inference in 5601 (b) (1) is invalid since presence at an illegal still carries no reasonable inference of the crime of possession, custody, or control of the still proscribed by 5601 (a) (1). United States v. Gainey, \n380 \nU.S. 63\n, distinguished. Pp. 139-144.\n\n\n 330 F.2d 566, affirmed.\n\nLouis F. Claiborne argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Acting Solicitor General Spritzer, Assistant Attorney General Vinson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit.\n\nW. Paul Flynn argued the cause and filed a brief for respondents. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nFederal officers, armed with a search warrant, entered one of the buildings in an industrial complex in Jewett City, Connecticut. There they found respondents standing a few feet from an operating still. Respondents\n1\n were indicted on three counts: Count 1 charged possession, custody and control of an illegal still in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (1);\n2\n Count 2, the illegal production of distilled spirits in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (8);\n3\n and Count 3, a conspiracy to produce distilled spirits. Both respondents were convicted on all three counts, both were fined on Count 1 and both sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each of the three counts.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions on Count 3. 330 F.2d 566. It reversed the convictions on Counts 1 and 2 because the trial court in instructing the jury read verbatim provisions of 5601 (b) (1)\n4\n and \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n 5601 (b) (4),\n5\n which provide in part that the presence of the defendant at the site of an illegal still \"shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury . . . .\" This instruction and the statutory inference which it embodied were held by the Court of Appeals to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We granted certiorari to consider this constitutional issue. \n380 \nU.S. 941\n.\n\nWe agree as to the invalidity of 5601 (b) (1) and the reversal of the convictions on Count 1. It is unnecessary, however, to consider the validity of 5601 (b) (4) and the convictions on Count 2 since the sentences on that count were concurrent with the sentences, not here challenged, which were imposed on Count 3. United States v. Gainey, \n380 \nU.S. 63, 65\n; Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 299\n.\n\nIf we were reviewing only the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict on Count 1, that conviction would be sustained. There was, as the Court of Appeals recognized, ample evidence in addition to presence at the still to support the charge of possession of an illegal still. But here, in addition to a standard instruction on reasonable doubt, the jury was told that the defendants' presence at the still \"shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction.\" This latter instruction may have been given considerable weight by the jury; the jury may have disbelieved or disregarded the other evidence of possession and convicted these defendants on \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n the evidence of presence alone. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that the validity of the statutory inference in the disputed instruction must be faced and decided.\n\nThe test to be applied to the kind of statutory inference involved in this criminal case is not in dispute. In Tot v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 463\n, the Court, relying on a line of cases dating from 1910,\n6\n reaffirmed the limits which the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments place \"upon the power of Congress or that of a state legislature to make the proof of one fact or group of facts evidence of the existence of the ultimate fact on which guilt is predicated.\" Id., at 467. Such a legislative determination would not be sustained if there was \"no rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the inference of the one from proof of the other is arbitrary because of lack of connection between the two in common experience. . . . [W]here the inference is so strained as not to have a reasonable relation to the circumstances of life as we know them, it is not competent for the legislature to create it as a rule governing the procedure of courts.\" Id., at 467-468. Judged by this standard, the statutory presumption in issue there was found constitutionally infirm.\n\nJust last Term, in United States v. Gainey, \n380 \nU.S. 63\n, the Court passed upon the validity of a companion section to 5601 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code. The constitutionality of the legislation was held to depend upon the \"rationality of the connection `between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed.'\" \n380 \nU.S., at 66\n. Tested by this rule, the Court sustained the provision of 26 U.S.C. 5601 (b) (2) declaring presence \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n at a still to be sufficient evidence to authorize conviction under 26 U.S.C. 5601 (a) (4) for carrying on the business of the distillery without giving the required bond. Noting that almost anyone at the site of a secret still could reasonably be said to be carrying on the business or aiding and abetting it and that Congress had accorded the evidence of presence only its \"natural probative force,\" the Court sustained the presumption.\n\nThis case is markedly different from Gainey, supra. Congress has chosen in the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to focus upon various phases and aspects of the distilling business and to make each of them a separate crime. Count 1 of this indictment charges \"possession, custody and . . . control\" of an illegal still as a separate, distinct offense. Section 5601 (a) (1) obviously has a much narrower coverage than has 5601 (a) (4) with its sweeping prohibition of carrying on a distilling business.\n\nIn Bozza v. United States, \n330 \nU.S. 160\n, the Court squarely held, and the United States conceded, that presence alone was insufficient evidence to convict of the specific offense proscribed by 5601 (a) (1), absent some evidence that the defendant engaged in conduct directly related to the crime of possession, custody or control. That offense was confined to those who had \"custody or possession\" of the still or acted in some \"other capacity calculated to facilitate the custody or possession, such as, for illustration, service as a caretaker, watchman, lookout or in some other capacity.\" Id., at 164. This requirement was not satisfied in the Bozza case either by the evidence showing participation in the distilling operations or by the fact that the defendant helped to carry the finished product to delivery vehicles. These facts, and certainly mere presence at the still, were insufficient proof that \"petitioner ever exercised, or aided the exercise of, any control over the distillery.\" Ibid. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPresence at an operating still is sufficient evidence to prove the charge of \"carrying on\" because anyone present at the site is very probably connected with the illegal enterprise. Whatever his job may be, he is at the very least aiding and abetting the substantive crime of carrying on the illegal distilling business. Section 5601 (a) (1), however, proscribes possession, custody or control. This is only one of the various aspects of the total undertaking, many of which have nothing at all to do with possession, as Bozza made quite clear and as the United States conceded in that case. Presence tells us only that the defendant was there and very likely played a part in the illicit scheme. But presence tells us nothing about what the defendant's specific function was and carries no legitimate, rational or reasonable inference that he was engaged in one of the specialized functions connected with possession, rather than in one of the supply, delivery or operational activities having nothing to do with possession. Presence is relevant and admissible evidence in a trial on a possession charge; but absent some showing of the defendant's function at the still, its connection with possession is too tenuous to permit a reasonable inference of guilt - \"the inference of the one from proof of the other is arbitrary . . . .\" Tot v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 463, 467\n.\n\nThe United States has presented no cases in the courts which have sustained a conviction for possession based solely on the evidence of presence. All of the cases which deal with this issue and with which we are familiar have held presence alone, unilluminated by other facts, to be insufficient proof of possession.\n7\n Moreover, the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 142]\n\u00a0\n Government apparently concedes in this case that except for the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the 1958 amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, which added the presumptions relating to illegal distilling operations, the crime of possession could not validly be inferred from mere presence at the still site.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nAccording to the Government, however, the 1958 amendments were, among other things, designed to overrule Bozza and must be viewed as broadening the substantive crime of possession to include all those present at a set-up still who have any connection with the illicit enterprise.\n9\n So broadened, it is argued, the substantive \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 143]\n\u00a0\n crime of \"possessing,\" under the teachings of Gainey, could be acceptably proved by showing presence alone.\n\nWe are not persuaded by this argument, primarily because the amendments did not change a word of 5601 (a) (1), which defines the substantive crime. Possession, custody or control remains the crime which the Government must prove. The amendments, insofar as relevant here, simply added 5601 (b) (1) and permitted an inference of possession from the fact of presence. Moreover, the inference was not irrebuttable. It was allowable only if the defendant failed to explain his presence to the satisfaction of the jury. Plainly, it seems to us, the defendant would be exonerated if he satisfactorily explained or the circumstances showed that his function at the still was not in furtherance of the specific crime of possession, custody or control. If a defendant is charged with possession and it is unmistakably shown that delivery, for example, was his sole duty, it would seem very odd under the present formulation of the Code to hold that his explanation had merely proved his guilt of \"possessing\" by showing some connection with the illegal business.\n\nThe Government's position would equate \"possessing\" with \"carrying on.\" We are not convinced that the amendments to the Code included in the Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958 were intended to work any such substantive change in the basic scheme of the Act, which was, in the words of the Government's brief in this Court, \"to make criminal every meaningful form of participation in, or assistance to, the operation of an illegal still by an elaborate pattern of partially redundant provisions - some specific and some general - designed to close all loopholes.\" Possession, custody or control was \n\n[382 \nU.S. 136, 144]\n\u00a0\n one of the specific crimes defined in the Code and we do not think that the 1958 amendments worked any change in this regard.\n10\n On the legislative record before us, we reject the Government's expansive reading of the 1958 amendments.\n\nCongress may have intended by the 1958 amendments to avoid the Bozza case. But it chose to do so, not by changing the definition of the substantive crime, but by declaring presence to be sufficient evidence to prove the crime of possession beyond reasonable doubt. This approach obviously fails under the standards traditionally applied to such legislation. It may be, of course, that Congress has the power to make presence at an illegal still a punishable crime, but we find no clear indication that it intended to so exercise this power.\n11\n The crime remains possession, not presence, and, with all due deference to the judgment of Congress, the former may not constitutionally be inferred from the latter.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the reversal of these convictions for the reasons stated in his dissent against affirmance of the conviction in United States v.

United States, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n These three cases involve the exemption claims under 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act of conscientious objectors who did not belong to an orthodox religious sect. Section 6 (j) excepts from combatant service in the armed forces those who are conscientiously opposed to participation in war by reason of their \"religious training and belief,\" i. e., belief in an individual's relation to a Supreme Being involving duties beyond a human relationship but not essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. In all the cases convictions were obtained in the District Courts for refusal to submit to induction in the armed forces; in Nos. 50 and 51 the Court of Appeals reversed and in No. 29 the conviction was affirmed.

The test of religious belief within the meaning of the exemption in 6 (j) is whether it is a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualified for the exemption. Pp. 173-180.\n\n\n  (a) The exemption does not cover those who oppose war from a merely personal moral code nor those who decide that war is wrong on the basis of essentially political, sociological or economic considerations rather than religious belief. P. 173.\n\n\n  (b) There is no issue here of atheistic beliefs and accordingly the decision does not deal with that question. Pp. 173-174.\n\n\n  (c) This test accords with long-established legislative policy of equal treatment for those whose objection to military service is based on religious beliefs.

Pp. 184-185.\n\n\n 3. Under the broad construction applicable to 6 (j) the applications involved in these cases, none of which was based on merely personal moral codes, qualified for exemption.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese cases involve claims of conscientious objectors under 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 456 (j) (1958 ed.), which exempts from combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States those persons who by \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 165]\n\u00a0\n reason of their religious training and belief are conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. The cases were consolidated for argument and we consider them together although each involves different facts and circumstances. The parties raise the basic question of the constitutionality of the section which defines the term \"religious training and belief,\" as used in the Act, as \"an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\" The constitutional attack is launched under the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses and is twofold: (1) The section does not exempt nonreligious conscientious objectors; and (2) it discriminates between different forms of religious expression in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Jakobson (No. 51) and Peter (No. 29) also claim that their beliefs come within the meaning of the section. Jakobson claims that he meets the standards of 6 (j) because his opposition to war is based on belief in a Supreme Reality and is therefore an obligation superior to one resulting from man's relationship to his fellow man. Peter contends that his opposition to war derives from his acceptance of the existence of a universal power beyond that of man and that this acceptance in fact constitutes belief in a Supreme Being, qualifying him for exemption. We granted certiorari in each of the cases because of their importance in the administration of the Act. \n377 \nU.S. 922\n.\n\nWe have concluded that Congress, in using the expression \"Supreme Being\" rather than the designation \"God,\" was merely clarifying the meaning of religious training and belief so as to embrace all religions and to exclude essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views. We believe that under this construction, the test of belief \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n \"in a relation to a Supreme Being\" is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is \"in a relation to a Supreme Being\" and the other is not. We have concluded that the beliefs of the objectors in these cases meet these criteria, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgments in Nos. 50 and 51 and reverse the judgment in No. 29.\n\n  THE FACTS IN THE CASES.\n\n\n No. 50: Seeger was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of New York of having refused to submit to induction in the armed forces. He was originally classified 1-A in 1953 by his local board, but this classification was changed in 1955 to 2-S (student) and he remained in this status until 1958 when he was reclassified 1-A. He first claimed exemption as a conscientious objector in 1957 after successive annual renewals of his student classification. Although he did not adopt verbatim the printed Selective Service System form, he declared that he was conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form by reason of his \"religious\" belief; that he preferred to leave the question as to his belief in a Supreme Being open, \"rather than answer `yes' or `no'\"; that his \"skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God\" did \"not necessarily mean lack of faith in anything whatsoever\"; that his was a \"belief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed.\" R. 69-70, 73. He cited such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza for support of his ethical belief in intellectual and moral integrity \"without belief in God, except in the remotest sense.\" R. 73. His belief was found to be sincere, honest, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n and made in good faith; and his conscientious objection to be based upon individual training and belief, both of which included research in religious and cultural fields. Seeger's claim, however, was denied solely because it was not based upon a \"belief in a relation to a Supreme Being\" as required by 6 (j) of the Act. At trial Seeger's counsel admitted that Seeger's belief was not in relation to a Supreme Being as commonly understood, but contended that he was entitled to the exemption because \"under the present law Mr. Seeger's position would also include definitions of religion which have been stated more recently,\" R. 49, and could be \"accommodated\" under the definition of religious training and belief in the Act, R. 53. He was convicted and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Supreme Being requirement of the section distinguished \"between internally derived and externally compelled beliefs\" and was, therefore, an \"impermissible classification\" under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 326 F.2d 846.\n\nNo. 51: Jakobson was also convicted in the Southern District of New York on a charge of refusing to submit to induction. On his appeal the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that rejection of his claim may have rested on the factual finding, erroneously made, that he did not believe in a Supreme Being as required by 6 (j). 325 F.2d 409.\n\nJakobson was originally classified 1-A in 1953 and intermittently enjoyed a student classification until 1956. It was not until April 1958 that he made claim to noncombatant classification (1-A-O) as a conscientious objector. He stated on the Selective Service System form that he believed in a \"Supreme Being\" who was \"Creator of Man\" in the sense of being \"ultimately responsible for the existence of\" man and who was \"the Supreme Reality\" of which \"the existence of man is the result.\" R. 44. (Emphasis in the original.) He explained that his religious \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n and social thinking had developed after much meditation and thought. He had concluded that man must be \"partly spiritual\" and, therefore, \"partly akin to the Supreme Reality\"; and that his \"most important religious law\" was that \"no man ought ever to wilfully sacrifice another man's life as a means to any other end . . . .\" R. 45-46. In December 1958 he requested a 1-O classification since he felt that participation in any form of military service would involve him in \"too many situations and relationships that would be a strain on [his] conscience that [he felt he] must avoid.\" R. 70. He submitted a long memorandum of \"notes on religion\" in which he defined religion as the \"sum and essence of one's basic attitudes to the fundamental problems of human existence,\" R. 72 (emphasis in the original); he said that he believed in \"Godness\" which was \"the Ultimate Cause for the fact of the Being of the Universe\"; that to deny its existence would but deny the existence of the universe because \"anything that Is, has an Ultimate Cause for its Being.\" R. 73. There was a relationship to Godness, he stated, in two directions, i. e., \"vertically, towards Godness directly,\" and \"horizontally, towards Godness through Mankind and the World.\" R. 74. He accepted the latter one. The Board classified him 1-A-O and Jakobson appealed. The hearing officer found that the claim was based upon a personal moral code and that he was not sincere in his claim. The Appeal Board classified him 1-A. It did not indicate upon what ground it based its decision, i. e., insincerity or a conclusion that his belief was only a personal moral code. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that his claim came within the requirements of 6 (j). Because it could not determine whether the Appeal Board had found that Jakobson's beliefs failed to come within the statutory definition, or whether it had concluded that he lacked sincerity, it directed dismissal of the indictment. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo. 29: Forest Britt Peter was convicted in the Northern District of California on a charge of refusing to submit to induction. In his Selective Service System form he stated that he was not a member of a religious sect or organization; he failed to execute section VII of the questionnaire but attached to it a quotation expressing opposition to war, in which he stated that he concurred. In a later form he hedged the question as to his belief in a Supreme Being by saying that it depended on the definition and he appended a statement that he felt it a violation of his moral code to take human life and that he considered this belief superior to his obligation to the state. As to whether his conviction was religious, he quoted with approval Reverend John Haynes Holmes' definition of religion as \"the consciousness of some power manifest in nature which helps man in the ordering of his life in harmony with its demands . . . [; it] is the supreme expression of human nature; it is man thinking his highest, feeling his deepest, and living his best.\" R. 27. The source of his conviction he attributed to reading and meditation \"in our democratic American culture, with its values derived from the western religious and philosophical tradition.\" Ibid. As to his belief in a Supreme Being, Peter stated that he supposed \"you could call that a belief in the Supreme Being or God. These just do not happen to be the words I use.\" R. 11. In 1959 he was classified 1-A, although there was no evidence in the record that he was not sincere in his beliefs. After his conviction for failure to report for induction the Court of Appeals, assuming arguendo that he was sincere, affirmed, 324 F.2d 173.\n\n   BACKGROUND OF 6 (j).\n\n\n Chief Justice Hughes, in his opinion in United States v. Macintosh, \n283 \nU.S. 605\n (1931), enunciated the rationale behind the long recognition of conscientious objection \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n to participation in war accorded by Congress in our various conscription laws when he declared that \"in the forum of conscience, duty to a moral power higher than the State has always been maintained.\" At 633 (dissenting opinion). In a similar vein Harlan Fiske Stone, later Chief Justice, drew from the Nation's past when he declared that\n\n \"both morals and sound policy require that the state  should not violate the conscience of the individual.  All our history gives confirmation to the view that  liberty of conscience has a moral and social value  which makes it worthy of preservation at the hands  of the state. So deep in its significance and vital,  indeed, is it to the integrity of man's moral and  spiritual nature that nothing short of the self-preservation  of the state should warrant its violation; and  it may well be questioned whether the state which  preserves its life by a settled policy of violation of  the conscience of the individual will not in fact ultimately  lose it by the process.\" Stone, The Conscientious  Objector, 21 Col. Univ. Q. 253, 269 (1919).\n\n\n Governmental recognition of the moral dilemma posed for persons of certain religious faiths by the call to arms came early in the history of this country. Various methods of ameliorating their difficulty were adopted by the Colonies, and were later perpetuated in state statutes and constitutions. Thus by the time of the Civil War there existed a state pattern of exempting conscientious objectors on religious grounds. In the Federal Militia Act of 1862 control of conscription was left primarily in the States. However, General Order No. 99, issued by the Adjutant General pursuant to that Act, provided for striking from the conscription list those who were exempted by the States; it also established a commutation or substitution system fashioned from earlier state enactments. With the Federal Conscription Act of 1863, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n which enacted the commutation and substitution provisions of General Order No. 99, the Federal Government occupied the field entirely, and in the 1864 Draft Act, 13 Stat. 9, it extended exemptions to those conscientious objectors who were members of religious denominations opposed to the bearing of arms and who were prohibited from doing so by the articles of faith of their denominations. Selective Service System Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection 40-41 (1950). In that same year the Confederacy exempted certain pacifist sects from military duty. Id., at 46.\n\nThe need for conscription did not again arise until World War I. The Draft Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 76, 78, afforded exemptions to conscientious objectors who were affiliated with a \"well-recognized religious sect or organization [then] organized and existing and whose existing creed or principles [forbade] its members to participate in war in any form . . . .\" The Act required that all persons be inducted into the armed services, but allowed the conscientious objectors to perform noncombatant service in capacities designated by the President of the United States. Although the 1917 Act excused religious objectors only, in December 1917, the Secretary of War instructed that \"personal scruples against war\" be considered as constituting \"conscientious objection.\" Selective Service System Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection 54-55 (1950). This Act, including its conscientious objector provisions, was upheld against constitutional attack in the Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366, 389\n-390 (1918).\n\nIn adopting the 1940 Selective Training and Service Act Congress broadened the exemption afforded in the 1917 Act by making it unnecessary to belong to a pacifist religious sect if the claimant's own opposition to war was based on \"religious training and belief.\" 54 Stat. 889. Those found to be within the exemption were \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n not inducted into the armed services but were assigned to noncombatant service under the supervision of the Selective Service System. The Congress recognized that one might be religious without belonging to an organized church just as surely as minority members of a faith not opposed to war might through religious reading reach a conviction against participation in war. Congress Looks at the Conscientious Objector (National Service Board for Religious Objectors, 1943) 71, 79, 83, 87, 88, 89. Indeed, the consensus of the witnesses appearing before the congressional committees was that individual belief - rather than membership in a church or sect - determined the duties that God imposed upon a person in his everyday conduct; and that \"there is a higher loyalty than loyalty to this country, loyalty to God.\" Id., at 29-31. See also the proposals which were made to the House Military Affairs Committee but rejected. Id., at 21-23. 82-83. 85. Thus, while shifting the test from membership in such a church to one's individual belief the Congress nevertheless continued its historic practice of excusing from armed service those who believed that they owed an obligation, superior to that due the state, of not participating in war in any form.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1948 two courts of appeals\n1\n held that the phrase \"religious training and belief\" did not include philosophical, social or political policy. Then in 1948 the Congress amended the language of the statute and declared that \"religious training and belief\" was to be defined as \"an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\" The only significant mention of \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 173]\n\u00a0\n this change in the provision appears in the report of the Senate Armed Services Committee recommending adoption. It said simply this: \"This section reenacts substantially the same provisions as were found in subsection 5 (g) of the 1940 act. Exemption extends to anyone who, because of religious training and belief in his relation to a Supreme Being, is conscientiously opposed to combatant military service or to both combatant and noncombatant military service. (See United States v. Berman [sic], 156 F. (2d) 377, certiorari denied, \n329 \nU.S. 795\n.)\" S. Rep. No. 1268, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., 14.\n\n  INTERPRETATION OF 6 (j).\n\n\n1. \nThe crux of the problem lies in the phrase \"religious training and belief\" which Congress has defined as \"belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.\" In assigning meaning to this statutory language we may narrow the inquiry by noting briefly those scruples expressly excepted from the definition. The section excludes those persons who, disavowing religious belief, decide on the basis of essentially political, sociological or economic considerations that war is wrong and that they will have no part of it. These judgments have historically been reserved for the Government, and in matters which can be said to fall within these areas the conviction of the individual has never been permitted to override that of the state. United States v. Macintosh, supra (dissenting opinion). The statute further excludes those whose opposition to war stems from a \"merely personal moral code,\" a phrase to which we shall have occasion to turn later in discussing the application of 6 (j) to these cases. We also pause to take note of what is not involved in this litigation. No party claims to be an atheist or attacks the statute on this ground. The question is not, therefore, one between theistic and atheistic beliefs. We do not deal with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 174]\n\u00a0\n or intimate any decision on that situation in these cases. Nor do the parties claim the monotheistic belief that there is but one God; what they claim (with the possible exception of Seeger who bases his position here not on factual but on purely constitutional grounds) is that they adhere to theism, which is the \"Belief in the existence of a god or gods; . . . Belief in superhuman powers or spiritual agencies in one or many gods,\" as opposed to atheism.\n2\n Our question, therefore, is the narrow one: Does the term \"Supreme Being\" as used in 6 (j) mean the orthodox God or the broader concept of a power or being, or a faith, \"to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent\"? Webster's New International Dictionary (Second Edition). In considering this question we resolve it solely in relation to the language of 6 (j) and not otherwise.\n\n2. Few would quarrel, we think, with the proposition that in no field of human endeavor has the tool of language proved so inadequate in the communication of ideas as it has in dealing with the fundamental questions of man's predicament in life, in death or in final judgment and retribution. This fact makes the task of discerning the intent of Congress in using the phrase \"Supreme Being\" a complex one. Nor is it made the easier by the richness and variety of spiritual life in our country. Over 250 sects inhabit our land. Some believe in a purely personal God, some in a supernatural deity; others think of religion as a way of life envisioning as its ultimate goal the day when all men can live together in perfect understanding and peace. There are those who think of God as the depth of our being; others, such as the Buddhists, strive for a state of lasting rest through self-denial and inner purification; in Hindu philosophy, the Supreme Being is \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 175]\n\u00a0\n the transcendental reality which is truth, knowledge and bliss. Even those religious groups which have traditionally opposed war in every form have splintered into various denominations: from 1940 to 1947 there were four denominations using the name \"Friends,\" Selective Service System Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection 13 (1950); the \"Church of the Brethren\" was the official name of the oldest and largest church body of four denominations composed of those commonly called Brethren, id., at 11; and the \"Mennonite Church\" was the largest of 17 denominations, including the Amish and Hutterites, grouped as \"Mennonite bodies\" in the 1936 report on the Census of Religious Bodies, id., at 9. This vast panoply of beliefs reveals the magnitude of the problem which faced the Congress when it set about providing an exemption from armed service. It also emphasizes the care that Congress realized was necessary in the fashioning of an exemption which would be in keeping with its long-established policy of not picking and choosing among religious beliefs.\n\nIn spite of the elusive nature of the inquiry, we are not without certain guidelines. In amending the 1940 Act, Congress adopted almost intact the language of Chief Justice Hughes in United States v. Macintosh, supra:\n\n\"The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.\" At 633-634. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n By comparing the statutory definition with those words, however, it becomes readily apparent that the Congress deliberately broadened them by substituting the phrase \"Supreme Being\" for the appellation \"God.\" And in so doing it is also significant that Congress did not elaborate on the form or nature of this higher authority which it chose to designate as \"Supreme Being.\" By so refraining it must have had in mind the admonitions of the Chief \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 176]\n\u00a0\n Justice when he said in the same opinion that even the word \"God\" had myriad meanings for men of faith:\n\n\"[P]utting aside dogmas with their particular conceptions of deity, freedom of conscience itself implies respect for an innate conviction of paramount duty. The battle for religious liberty has been fought and won with respect to religious beliefs and practices, which are not in conflict with good order, upon the very ground of the supremacy of conscience within its proper field.\" At 634.\n\n\n Moreover, the Senate Report on the bill specifically states that 6 (j) was intended to re-enact \"substantially the same provisions as were found\" in the 1940 Act. That statute, of course, refers to \"religious training and belief\" without more. Admittedly, all of the parties here purport to base their objection on religious belief. It appears, therefore, that we need only look to this clear statement of congressional intent as set out in the report. Under the 1940 Act it was necessary only to have a conviction based upon religious training and belief; we believe that is all that is required here. Within that phrase would come all sincere religious beliefs which are based upon a power or being, or upon a faith, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent. The test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition. This construction avoids imputing to Congress an intent to classify different religious beliefs, exempting some and excluding others, and is in accord with the well-established congressional policy of equal treatment for those whose opposition to service is grounded in their religious tenets. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 177]\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. The Government takes the position that since Berman v. United States, supra, was cited in the Senate Report on the 1948 Act, Congress must have desired to adopt the Berman interpretation of what constitutes \"religious belief.\" Such a claim, however, will not bear scrutiny. First, we think it clear that an explicit statement of congressional intent deserves more weight than the parenthetical citation of a case which might stand for a number of things. Congress specifically stated that it intended to re-enact substantially the same provisions as were found in the 1940 Act. Moreover, the history of that Act reveals no evidence of a desire to restrict the concept of religious belief. On the contrary the Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee which reported out the 1940 exemption provisions stated:\n\n\"We heard the conscientious objectors and all of their representatives that we could possibly hear, and, summing it all up, their whole objection to the bill, aside from their objection to compulsory military training, was based upon the right of conscientious objection and in most instances to the right of the ministerial students to continue in their studies, and we have provided ample protection for those classes and those groups.\" 86 Cong. Rec. 11368 (1940).\n\n\n During the House debate on the bill, Mr. Faddis of Pennsylvania made the following statement:\n\n \"We have made provision to take care of conscientious objectors. I am sure the committee has had all the sympathy in the world with those who appeared claiming to have religious scruples against rendering military service in its various degrees. Some appeared who had conscientious scruples against handling lethal weapons, but who had no \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 178]\n\u00a0\n scruples against performing other duties which did not actually bring them into combat. Others appeared who claimed to have conscientious scruples against participating in any of the activities that would go along with the Army. The committee took all of these into consideration and has written a bill which. I believe, will take care of all the reasonable objections of this class of people.\" 86 Cong. Rec. 11418 (1940).\n\n\n Thus the history of the Act belies the notion that it was to be restrictive in application and available only to those believing in a traditional God.\n\nAs for the citation to Berman, it might mean a number of things. But we think that Congress' action in citing it must be construed in such a way as to make it consistent with its express statement that it meant substantially to re-enact the 1940 provision. As far as we can find, there is not one word to indicate congressional concern over any conflict between Kauten and Berman. Surely, if it thought that two clashing interpretations as to what amounted to \"religious belief\" had to be resolved. it would have said so somewhere in its deliberations. Thus, we think that rather than citing Berman for what it said \"religious belief\" was, Congress cited it for what it said \"religious belief\" was not. For both Kauten and Berman hold in common the conclusion that exemption must be denied to those whose beliefs are political, social or philosophical in nature, rather than religious. Both, in fact, denied exemption on that very ground. It seems more likely, therefore, that it was this point which led Congress to cite Berman. The first part of the 6 (j) definition - belief in a relation to a Supreme Being - was indeed set out in Berman, with the exception that the court used the word \"God\" rather than \"Supreme Being.\" However, as the Government recognizes, Berman took that language word for word from Macintosh. Far from \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 179]\n\u00a0\n requiring a conclusion contrary to the one we reach here, Chief Justice Hughes' opinion, as we have pointed out, supports our interpretation.\n\nAdmittedly, the second half of the statutory definition - the rejection of sociological and moral views - was taken directly from Berman. But, as we have noted, this same view was adhered to in United States v. Kauten, supra. Indeed the Selective Service System has stated its view of the cases' significance in these terms: \"The United States v. Kauten and Herman Berman v. United States cases ruled that a valid conscientious objector claim to exemption must be based solely on `religious training and belief' and not on philosophical, political, social, or other grounds . . . .\" Selective Service System Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection 337 (1950). See id., at 278. That the conclusions of the Selective Service System are not to be taken lightly is evidenced in this statement by Senator Gurney, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and sponsor of the Senate bill containing the present version of 6 (j):\n\n\"The bill which is now pending follows the 1940 act, with very few technical amendments, worked out by those in Selective Service who had charge of the conscientious-objector problem during the war.\" 94 Cong. Rec. 7305 (1948).\n\n\n Thus we conclude that in enacting 6 (j) Congress simply made explicit what the courts of appeals had correctly found implicit in the 1940 Act. Moreover, it is perfectly reasonable that Congress should have selected Berman for its citation, since this Court denied certiorari in that case, a circumstance not present in Kauten.\n\nSection 6 (j), then, is no more than a clarification of the 1940 provision involving only certain \"technical amendments,\" to use the words of Senator Gurney. As such it continues the congressional policy of providing exemption from military service for those whose opposition \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 180]\n\u00a0\n is based on grounds that can fairly be said to be \"religious.\"\n3\n To hold otherwise would not only fly in the face of Congress' entire action in the past; it would ignore the historic position of our country on this issue since its founding.\n\n4. Moreover, we believe this construction embraces the ever-broadening understanding of the modern religious community. The eminent Protestant theologian, Dr. Paul Tillich, whose views the Government concedes would come within the statute, identifies God not as a projection \"out there\" or beyond the skies but as the ground of our very being. The Court of Appeals stated in No. 51 that Jakobson's views \"parallel [those of] this eminent theologian rather strikingly.\" 325 F.2d, at 415-416. In his book, Systematic Theology, Dr. Tillich says:\n\n \"I have written of the God above the God of  theism . . . . In such a state [of self-affirmation] the  God of both religious and theological language disappears.  But something remains, namely, the seriousness  of that doubt in which meaning within meaninglessness  is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of  meaning within meaninglessness, of certitude within  doubt, is not the God of traditional theism but the  `God above God,' the power of being, which works  through those who have no name for it, not even the  name God.\" II Systematic Theology 12 (1957). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 181]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Another eminent cleric, the Bishop of Woolwich, John A. T. Robinson, in his book, Honest To God (1963), states:\n\n \"The Bible speaks of a God `up there.' No doubt its picture of a three-decker universe, of `the heaven above, the earth beneath and the waters under the earth,' was once taken quite literally. . . .\" At 11. \"[Later] in place of a God who is literally or physically `up there' we have accepted, as part of our mental furniture, a God who is spiritually or metaphysically `out there.' . . . But now it seems there is no room for him, not merely in the inn, but in the entire universe: for there are no vacant places left. In reality, of course, our new view of the universe has made not the slightest difference. . . .\" At 13-14.\n\n\n \"But the idea of a God spiritually or metaphysically `out there' dies very much harder. Indeed, most people would be seriously disturbed by the thought that it should need to die at all. For it is their God, and they have nothing to put in its place. . . . Every one of us lives with some mental picture of a God `out there,' a God who `exists' above and beyond the world he made, a God `to' whom we pray and to whom we `go' when we die.\" At 14.\n\n\n\"But the signs are that we are reaching the point at which the whole conception of a God `out there,' which has served us so well since the collapse of the three-decker universe, is itself becoming more of a hindrance than a help.\" At 15-16. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n The Schema of the recent Ecumenical Council included a most significant declaration on religion:\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 182]\n\u00a0\n\n\n \"The community of all peoples is one. One is their origin, for God made the entire human race live on all the face of the earth. One, too, is their ultimate end, God. Men expect from the various religions answers to the riddles of the human condition: What is man? What is the meaning and purpose of our lives? What is the moral good and what is sin? What are death, judgment, and retribution after death?\n\n\n  .  . .  .  .\n\n\n \"Ever since primordial days, numerous peoples have had a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers over the course of things and over the events that make up the lives of men; some have even come to know of a Supreme Being and Father. Religions in an advanced culture have been able to use more refined concepts and a more developed language in their struggle for an answer to man's religious questions.\n\n\n .  .  .  . .\n\n\n \"Nothing that is true and holy in these religions is scorned by the Catholic Church. Ceaselessly the Church proclaims Christ, `the Way, the Truth, and the Life,' in whom God reconciled all things to Himself. The Church regards with sincere reverence those ways of action and of life, precepts and teachings which, although they differ from the ones she sets forth, reflect nonetheless a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men.\"\n\n\n Dr. David Saville Muzzey, a leader in the Ethical Culture Movement, states in his book, Ethics As a Religion (1951), that \"[e]verybody except the avowed atheists (and they are comparatively few) believes in some kind of God,\" and that \"The proper question to ask, therefore, is \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 183]\n\u00a0\n not the futile one, Do you believe in God? but rather, What kind of God do you believe in?\" Id., at 86-87. Dr. Muzzey attempts to answer that question:\n\n\"Instead of positing a personal God, whose existence man can neither prove nor disprove, the ethical concept is founded on human experience. It is anthropocentric, not theocentric. Religion, for all the various definitions that have been given of it, must surely mean the devotion of man to the highest ideal that he can conceive. And that ideal is a community of spirits in which the latent moral potentialities of men shall have been elicited by their reciprocal endeavors to cultivate the best in their fellow men. What ultimate reality is we do not know; but we have the faith that it expresses itself in the human world as the power which inspires in men moral purpose.\" At 95.\n\n\n\"Thus the `God' that we love is not the figure on the great white throne, but the perfect pattern, envisioned by faith, of humanity as it should be, purged of the evil elements which retard its progress toward `the knowledge, love and practice of the right.'\" At 98.\n\n\n These are but a few of the views that comprise the broad spectrum of religious beliefs found among us. But they demonstrate very clearly the diverse manners in which beliefs, equally paramount in the lives of their possessors, may be articulated. They further reveal the difficulties inherent in placing too narrow a construction on the provisions of 6 (j) and thereby lend conclusive support to the construction which we today find that Congress intended.\n\n5. We recognize the difficulties that have always faced the trier of fact in these cases. We hope that the test that we lay down proves less onerous. The examiner is furnished \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 184]\n\u00a0\n a standard that permits consideration of criteria with which he has had considerable experience. While the applicant's words may differ, the test is simple of application. It is essentially an objective one, namely, does the claimed belief occupy the same place in the life of the objector as an orthodox belief in God holds in the life of one clearly qualified for exemption?\n\nMoreover, it must be remembered that in resolving these exemption problems one deals with the beliefs of different individuals who will articulate them in a multitude of ways. In such an intensely personal area, of course, the claim of the registrant that his belief is an essential part of a religious faith must be given great weight. Recognition of this was implicit in this language, cited by the Berman court from State v. Amana Society, 132 Iowa 304, 109 N. W. 894 (1906):\n\n\"Surely a scheme of life designed to obviate [man's inhumanity to man], and by removing temptations, and all the allurements of ambition and avarice, to nurture the virtues of unselfishness, patience, love, and service, ought not to be denounced as not pertaining to religion when its devotees regard it as an essential tenet of their religious faith.\" 132 Iowa, at 315, 109 N. W., at 898, cited in Berman v. United States, 156 F.2d 377, 381. (Emphasis by the Court of Appeals.)\n\n\n The validity of what he believes cannot be questioned. Some theologians, and indeed some examiners, might be tempted to question the existence of the registrant's \"Supreme Being\" or the truth of his concepts. But these are inquiries foreclosed to Government. AS MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS stated in United States v. Ballard, \n322 \nU.S. 78, 86\n (1944): \"Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others.\" Local \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 185]\n\u00a0\n boards and courts in this sense are not free to reject beliefs because they consider them \"incomprehensible.\" Their task is to decide whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether they are, in his own scheme of things, religious.\n\nBut we hasten to emphasize that while the \"truth\" of a belief is not open to question, there remains the significant question whether it is \"truly held.\" This is the threshold question of sincerity which must be resolved in every case. It is, of course, a question of fact - a prime consideration to the validity of every claim for exemption as a conscientious objector. The Act provides a comprehensive scheme for assisting the Appeal Boards in making this determination, placing at their service the facilities of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and hearing officers. Finally, we would point out that in Estep v. United States, \n327 \nU.S. 114\n (1946), this Court held that:\n\n\"The provision making the decisions of the local boards `final' means to us that Congress chose not to give administrative action under this Act the customary scope of judicial review which obtains under other statutes. It means that the courts are not to weigh the evidence to determine whether the classification made by the local boards was justified. The decisions of the local boards made in conformity with the regulations are final even though they may be erroneous. The question of jurisdiction of the local board is reached only if there is no basis in fact for the classification which it gave the registrant.\" At 122-123.\n\n\n  APPLICATION OF 6 (j) TO THE INSTANT CASES.\n\n\n As we noted earlier, the statutory definition excepts those registrants whose beliefs are based on a \"merely personal moral code.\" The records in these cases, however, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 186]\n\u00a0\n show that at no time did any one of the applicants suggest that his objection was based on a \"merely personal moral code.\" Indeed at the outset each of them claimed in his application that his objection was based on a religious belief. We have construed the statutory definition broadly and it follows that any exception to it must be interpreted narrowly The use by Congress of the words \"merely personal\" seems to us to restrict the exception to a moral code which is not only personal but which is the sole basis for the registrant's belief and is in no way related to a Supreme Being. It follows, therefore, that if the claimed religious beliefs of the respective registrants in these cases meet the test that we lay down then their objections cannot be based on a \"merely personal\" moral code.\n\nIn Seeger, No. 50, the Court of Appeals failed to find sufficient \"externally compelled beliefs.\" However, it did find that \"it would seem impossible to say with assurance that [Seeger] is not bowing to `external commands' in virtually the same sense as is the objector who defers to the will of a supernatural power.\" 326 F.2d, at 853. It found little distinction between Jakobson's devotion to a mystical force of \"Godness\" and Seeger's compulsion to \"goodness.\" Of course, as we have said, the statute does not distinguish between externally and internally derived beliefs. Such a determination would, as the Court of Appeals observed, prove impossible as a practical matter, and we have found that Congress intended no such distinction.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also found that there was no question of the applicant's sincerity. He was a product of a devout Roman Catholic home; he was a close student of Quaker beliefs from which he said \"much of [his] thought is derived\"; he approved of their opposition to war in any form; he devoted his spare hours to the American \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 187]\n\u00a0\n Friends Service Committee and was assigned to hospital duty.\n\nIn summary, Seeger professed \"religious belief\" and \"religious faith.\" He did not disavow any belief \"in a relation to a Supreme Being\"; indeed he stated that \"the cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence.\" He decried the tremendous \"spiritual\" price man must pay for his willingness to destroy human life. In light of his beliefs and the unquestioned sincerity with which he held them, we think the Board, had it applied the test we propose today, would have granted him the exemption. We think it clear that the beliefs which prompted his objection occupy the same place in his life as the belief in a traditional deity holds in the lives of his friends, the Quakers. We are reminded once more of Dr. Tillich's thoughts:\n\n\"And if that word [God] has not much meaning for you, translate it, and speak of the depths of your life, of the source of your being, of your ultimate concern, of what you take seriously without any reservation. Perhaps, in order to do so, you must forget everything traditional that you have learned about God . . . .\" Tillich, The Shaking of the Foundations 57 (1948). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n It may be that Seeger did not clearly demonstrate what his beliefs were with regard to the usual understanding of the term \"Supreme Being.\" But as we have said Congress did not intend that to be the test. We therefore affirm the judgment in No. 50.\n\nIn Jakobson, No. 51, the Court of Appeals found that the registrant demonstrated that his belief as to opposition to war was related to a Supreme Being. We agree and affirm that judgment.\n\nWe reach a like conclusion in No. 29. It will be remembered that Peter acknowledged \"some power manifest in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 188]\n\u00a0\n nature . . . the supreme expression\" that helps man in ordering his life. As to whether he would call that belief in a Supreme Being, he replied, \"you could call that a belief in the Supreme Being or God. These just do not happen to be the words I use.\" We think that under the test we establish here the Board would grant the exemption to Peter and we therefore reverse the judgment in No. 29.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See United States v.

But it is, in my opinion, not a tour de force if we construe the words \"Supreme Being\" to include the cosmos, as well as an anthropomorphic entity. If it is a tour de force so to hold, it is no more so than other instances where we have gone to extremes to construe an Act of Congress to save it from demise on constitutional grounds. In a more extreme case than the present one we said that the words of a statute may be strained \"in the candid service of avoiding a serious constitutional doubt.\" United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 47\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe words \"a Supreme Being\" have no narrow technical meaning in the field of religion. Long before the birth of our Judeo-Christian civilization the idea of God had taken hold in many forms. Mention of only two - Hinduism and Buddhism - illustrates the fluidity and evanescent scope of the concept. In the Hindu religion the Supreme Being is conceived in the forms of several cult Deities. The chief of these, which stand for the Hindu Triad, are Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Another Deity, and the one most widely worshipped, is Sakti, the Mother Goddess, conceived as power, both destructive and creative. Though Hindu religion encompasses the worship of many Deities, it believes in only one single God, the eternally existent One Being with his manifold attributes and manifestations. This idea is expressed in Rigveda, the earliest sacred text of the Hindus, in verse 46 of a hymn attributed to the mythical seer Dirghatamas (Rigveda, I, 164):\n\n\"They call it Indra, Mitra, Varuna and Agni And also heavenly beautiful Garutman: The Real is One, though sages name it variously - They call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.\"\n\n\n See Smart, Reasons and Faiths, p. 35, n. 1 (1958); 32 Harvard Oriental Series, pp. 434-435 (Lanman ed. 1925). See generally 31 and 32 id.; Editors of Life Magazine. The World's Great Religions, Vol. 1, pp. 17-48 (1963).\n\nIndian philosophy, which comprises several schools of thought, has advanced different theories of the nature of the Supreme Being. According to the Upanisads, Hindu sacred texts, the Supreme Being is described as the power which creates and sustains everything, and to which the created things return upon dissolution. The word which is commonly used in the Upanisads to indicate the Supreme Being is Brahman. Philosophically, the \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 190]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Being is the transcendental Reality which is Truth, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the source of the entire universe. In this aspect Brahman is Isvara, a personal Lord and Creator of the universe, an object of worship. But, in the view of one school of thought, that of Sankara, even this is an imperfect and limited conception of Brahman which must be transcended: to think of Brahman as the Creator of the material world is necessarily to form a concept infected with illusion, or maya - which is what the world really is, in highest truth. Ultimately, mystically, Brahman must be understood as without attributes, as neti neti (not this, not that). See Smart, op. cit., supra, p. 133.\n\nBuddhism - whose advent marked the reform of Hinduism - continued somewhat the same concept. As stated by Nancy Wilson Ross, \"God - if I may borrow that word for a moment - the universe, and man are one indissoluble existence, one total whole. Only THIS - capital THIS - is. Anything and everything that appears to us as an individual entity or phenomenon, whether it be a planet or an atom, a mouse or a man, is but a temporary manifestation of THIS in form; every activity that takes place, whether it be birth or death, loving or eating breakfast, is but a temporary manifestation of THIS in activity. When we look at things this way, naturally we cannot believe that each individual person has been endowed with a special and individual soul or self. Each one of us is but a cell, as it were, in the body of the Great Self, a cell that comes into being, performs its functions, and passes away, transformed into another manifestation. Though we have temporary individuality, that temporary, limited individuality is not either a true self or our true self. Our true self is the Great Self; our true body is the Body of Reality, or the Dharmakaya, to give it its technical Buddhist name.\" The World of Zen, p. 18 (1960). \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 191]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDoes a Buddhist believe in \"God\" or a \"Supreme Being\"? That, of course, depends on how one defines \"God,\" as one eminent student of Buddhism has explained:\n\n\"It has often been suggested that Buddhism is an atheistic system of thought, and this assumption has given rise to quite a number of discussions. Some have claimed that since Buddhism knew no God, it could not be a religion; others that since Buddhism obviously was a religion which knew no God, the belief in God was not essential to religion. These discussions assume that God is an unambiguous term, which is by no means the case.\" Conze, Buddhism, pp. 38-39 (1959).\n\n\n Dr. Conze then says that if \"God\" is taken to mean a personal Creator of the universe, then the Buddhist has no interest in the concept. Id., p. 39. But if \"God\" means something like the state of oneness with God as described by some Christian mystics, then the Buddhist surely believes in \"God,\" since this state is almost indistinguishable from the Buddhist concept of Nirvana, \"the supreme Reality; . . . the eternal, hidden and incomprehensible Peace.\" Id., pp. 39-40. And finally, if \"God\" means one of the many Deities in an at least superficially polytheistic religion like Hinduism, then Buddhism tolerates a belief in many Gods: \"the Buddhists believe that a Faith can be kept alive only if it can be adapted to the mental habits of the average person. In consequence, we find that, in the earlier Scriptures, the deities of Brahmanism are taken for granted and that, later on, the Buddhists adopted the local Gods of any district to which they came.\" Id., p. 42.\n\nWhen the present Act was adopted in 1948 we were a nation of Buddhists, Confucianists, and Taoists, as well as Christians. Hawaii, then a Territory, was indeed filled with Buddhists, Buddhism being \"probably the major \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 192]\n\u00a0\n faith, if Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are deemed different faiths.\" Stokes and Pfeffer, Church and State in the United States, p. 560 (1964). Organized Buddhism first came to Hawaii in 1887 when Japanese laborers were brought to work on the plantations. There are now numerous Buddhist sects in Hawaii, and the temple of the Shin sect in Honolulu is said to have the largest congregation of any religious organization in the city. See Mulholland, Religion in Hawaii, pp. 44-50 (1961).\n\nIn the continental United States Buddhism is found \"in real strength\" in Utah, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, and California. \"Most of the Buddhists in the United States are Japanese or Japanese-Americans; however, there are `English' departments in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Tacoma.\" Mead, Handbook of Denominations, p. 61 (1961). The Buddhist Churches of North America, organized in 1914 as the Buddhist Mission of North America and incorporated under the present name in 1942, represent the Jodo Shinshu Sect of Buddhism in this country. This sect is the only Buddhist group reporting information to the annual Yearbook of American Churches. In 1961, the latest year for which figures are available, this group alone had 55 churches and an inclusive membership of 60,000; it maintained 89 church schools with a total enrollment of 11,150. Yearbook of American Churches, p. 30 (1965). According to one source, the total number of Buddhists of all sects in North America is 171,000. See World Almanac, p. 636 (1965).\n\nWhen the Congress spoke in the vague general terms of a Supreme Being I cannot, therefore, assume that it was so parochial as to use the words in the narrow sense urged on us. I would attribute tolerance and sophistication to the Congress, commensurate with the religious complexion of our communities. In sum, I agree with the Court that any person opposed to war on the basis of a sincere belief, which in his life fills the same place as a belief \n\n[380 \nU.S. 163, 193]\n\u00a0\n in God fills in the life of an orthodox religionist, is entitled to exemption under the statute. None comes to us an avowedly irreligious person or as an atheist;\n2\n one, as a sincere believer in \"goodness and virtue for their own sakes.\" His questions and doubts on theological issues, and his wonder, are no more alien to the statutory standard than are the awe-inspired questions of a devout Buddhist.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see Crowell v.

SPEERS(1965)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 20, 1965Decided: December 13, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Federal taxes were assessed against a company but despite demand were not paid. No notice was filed of the lien which ensued under 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Thereafter the company filed a petition in bankruptcy. The trustee treated the Government as an unsecured claimant whose lien was invalid as to him, basing his position on 70c of the Bankruptcy Act and 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 70c vests a trustee as of the bankruptcy date with all the rights of \"a creditor then holding a lien\" on a bankrupt's assets by \"legal . . . proceedings\"; 6323 permits a \"judgment creditor\" to prevail over an unrecorded federal tax lien. The trustee's position was upheld by the referee, District Court, and Court of Appeals. Held: A bankruptcy trustee has the status of a statutory \"judgment creditor\" and as such prevails over an unrecorded federal tax lien. Pp. 269-278.\n\n (a) The language in United States v. Gilbert Associates, \n345 \nU.S. 361\n, that the term \"judgment creditor\" in the predecessor of 6323 referred to a holder of a judgment of a court of record, must be read in context and does not govern the rights conferred by Congress upon a trustee in bankruptcy. Pp. 269-271.\n\n\n (b) The language and legislative history of 70c and 6323 reflect a congressional purpose to confer all the rights of a judgment creditor upon the trustee in bankruptcy, including the right to avoid an unrecorded federal tax lien. Pp. 271-275.\n\n\n (c) That failure to accord the Government priority for its unrecorded lien may benefit other claimants in a bankruptcy proceeding by improving their relative positions as creditors (a result which the Government can avoid by promptly filing notice of the lien) is a matter of congressional policy. Pp. 275-277.\n\n\n (d) The provision in 67b of the Bankruptcy Act that a statutory lien, including a federal tax lien, not perfected until after bankruptcy may nevertheless be valid as against the trustee does not preclude construing 6323 to include the trustee, since the \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 267]\n\u00a0\n purpose of 67b insofar as tax claims are concerned is to protect them from 60, which allows the trustee to set aside preferential transfers made within four months of bankruptcy. Pp. 277-278.\n\n\n 335 F.2d 311, affirmed.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General Roberts argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer and I. Henry Kutz.\n\nRobert B. Gosline argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents the question whether a federal tax lien, unrecorded as of the time of bankruptcy, is valid as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\n\nOn June 3, 1960, a District Director of Internal Revenue assessed more than $14,000 in withholding taxes and interest against the Kurtz Roofing Company. Demand for payment was made, and the taxpayer refused to pay. This gave rise to a federal tax lien.\n1\n Notice of the lien was not filed either in the Office of the Recorder of Erie County, Ohio, where Kurtz had its principal place of business, or in the United States District Court, at least \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n not before February of 1961.\n2\n On June 20, 1960, Kurtz filed a petition in bankruptcy. In the ensuing proceedings the trustee took the position that the federal tax lien was invalid as to him. He relied upon 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 110 (c) (1964 ed.), which, he asserted, vested in him the rights of a \"judgment creditor,\" and upon 26 U.S.C. 6323 (1964 ed.), which entitles a \"judgment creditor\" to prevail over an unrecorded federal tax lien. Section 70c provides in part:\n\n\"The trustee, as to all property, whether or not coming into possession or control of the court, upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy, shall be deemed vested as of such date with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings, whether or not such a creditor actually exists.\"\n\n\n Section 6323 provides in part:\n\n\"[T]he lien imposed by section 6321 shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Secretary or his delegate . . . .\"\n\n\n The trustee's position, in short, was that his statutory lien attached to all property of the bankrupt as of the date of filing of the petition; that he was a statutory \"judgment creditor\"; and that, under 6323, the unrecorded tax lien of the United States was not valid against him. This position, if sustained, would reduce the Government's claim for unpaid taxes to the status of an unsecured \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 269]\n\u00a0\n claim, sharing fourth-class priority with unsecured state and local tax claims under 64a (4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 104 (a) (4) (1964 ed.), and ranking behind administrative expenses, certain wage claims, and specified creditors' expenses.\n3\n The result in the present case is that instead of recovering the full amount owing to it, the United States would receive only 53.48%.\n\nThe trustee's position was affirmed by the referee, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 335 F.2d 311. Certiorari was granted, \n379 \nU.S. 958\n, to resolve the conceded conflict between decisions of Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits\n4\n and the decision below. We affirm.\n\nDespite the language of the applicable statutory provisions, 70c and 6323, most of the Courts of Appeals passing on the question have sustained the validity of an unrecorded federal tax lien as against the trustee in bankruptcy. They have arrived at this result on the authority of a statement in United States v. Gilbert Associates, Inc., \n345 \nU.S. 361, 364\n, that the phrase \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n \"judgment creditor\" in 3672, the predecessor of 6323, was used by Congress \"in the usual, conventional sense of a judgment of a court of record . . . .\"\n\nIt is clear, however, that this characterization was not intended to exclude a trustee in bankruptcy from the scope of the phrase \"judgment creditor.\" The issue before the Court in Gilbert was quite different.\n\nGilbert involved neither a bankruptcy proceeding nor the rights of a trustee in bankruptcy. Gilbert arose out of a state insolvency proceeding. The issue was whether an unrecorded federal tax lien was valid as against a municipal tax assessment which had neither been reduced to judgment nor accorded \"judgment creditor\" status by any statute. The asserted superior position of the local tax claim was based upon the fact that the New Hampshire court, in the Gilbert insolvency proceeding, had, for the first time, conveniently characterized the local tax claim as \"in the nature of a judgment,\" relying upon the procedures used by the taxing authorities.\n5\n Because the effect of federal tax liens should not be determined by the diverse rules of the various States, the Court held that the municipality was not a \"judgment creditor\" for purposes of the federal statute. The Court said:\n\n\"A cardinal principle of Congress in its tax scheme is uniformity, as far as may be. Therefore, a `judgment creditor' should have the same application in all the states. In this instance, we think Congress used the words `judgment creditor' in 3672 in the usual, conventional sense of a judgment of a court of record, since all states have such courts. We do not think Congress had in mind the action of taxing authorities who may be acting judicially as in New Hampshire and some other states, where the end result is something `in the nature of a judgment,' \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n while in other states the taxing authorities act quasi-judicially and are considered administrative bodies.\" (Footnotes omitted.) \n345 \nU.S., at 364\n.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n In view of the nature of the claim for which superiority was asserted and because its dominant theme was the need for uniformity in construing the meaning of 3672, Gilbert cannot be considered as governing the entirely different situation with respect to the rights conferred by Congress upon a trustee in bankruptcy. In the latter circumstance we are confronted with a specific congressional Act defining the status of the trustee. We have no problem of evaluating widely differing state laws. We have no possibility of unequal application of the federal tax laws, depending upon variances in the terms and phraseology of different state and local tax assessment statutes and judicial rulings thereon. Here we are faced with a uniform federal scheme - the rights of the trustee in bankruptcy in light of an unequivocal statement by Congress that he shall have \"all\" the rights of a judicial lien creditor with respect to the bankrupt's property.\n\nThe legislative history lends support to the conclusion drawn from the statutory language that the purpose of Congress was to invalidate an unrecorded federal tax \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n lien as against the trustee in bankruptcy. It was in 1910 that Congress enacted the predecessor of 70c, vesting the trustee \"with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a judgment creditor.\"\n7\n Three years later, in 1913, Congress enacted the predecessor of 6323, providing that an unrecorded federal tax lien was invalid as against a \"judgment creditor.\"\n8\n These two statutes, with their corresponding references to \"judgment creditor,\" co-existed for nearly 40 years. During that period, and prior to our decision in Gilbert in 1953, the only Court of Appeals squarely to pass upon the question decided that the trustee was a \"judgment creditor\" for purposes of avoiding an unrecorded federal tax lien. United States v. Sands, 174 F.2d 384, 385 (C. A. 2d Cir.), rejecting contrary dictum in In re Taylorcraft Aviation Corp., 168 F.2d 808, 810 (C. A. 6th Cir.).\n\nIn amending the Bankruptcy Act in 1950, Congress deleted from 70c the phrase \"judgment creditor,\" providing instead that whether or not the bankrupt's property was in possession or control of the court, the trustee was to have \"all the rights, remedies, and powers\" of a creditor holding a judicial lien.\n9\n Elsewhere in the same \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 273]\n\u00a0\n legislation it was recognized that the category of those holding judicial liens includes judgment creditors,\n10\n and a judicial lien holder generally has \"greater rights than a judgment creditor.\"\n11\n It is clear, therefore, that, with respect to the present problem, it was not the purpose of the 1950 amendments to reduce the powers of the trustee. As the House report accompanying the legislation noted, the revision of 70c \"has been placed in the bill for the protection of trustees in bankruptcy . . . also to simplify, and to some extent expand, the general expression of the rights of trustees in bankruptcy.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1954 Congress dealt explicitly with the question whether the trustee ought to prevail against unrecorded federal tax liens. An unsuccessful effort was made, reflected in the House version of the proposed 6323, expressly to exclude \"artificial\" judgment creditors like the trustee in bankruptcy.\n13\n At conference, the House \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 274]\n\u00a0\n conferees acceded to the views of the Senate, which deemed it \"advisable to continue to rely upon judicial interpretation of existing law instead of attempting to prescribe specific statutory rules.\"\n14\n The Government suggests that the \"existing law\" sought to be preserved was this Court's decision in Gilbert. But as of the date of the 1954 amendments, Gilbert had not yet been applied by any court to displace the rights of the trustee in bankruptcy as against an unrecorded federal tax lien. So far as that issue is concerned, it is more likely that reference to \"existing law\" was to the specific and then unchallenged rule announced by the Second Circuit in United States v. Sands, supra, and by other courts in other cases holding the trustee to have the rights of a judgment creditor.\n15\n As we have already noted, Gilbert is not inconsistent with the rule announced in Sands.\n\nIn recent years, and since the view began to spread that Gilbert compelled exclusion of the trustee from the benefits of 6323, legislation has been introduced expressly to reiterate the trustee's power to upset unrecorded federal tax liens.\n16\n Such legislation was proposed \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 275]\n\u00a0\n not to alter the statutory scheme, but to remove what was thought to be an erroneous gloss placed upon it by the courts. Thus, both Senate and House committee reports accompanying a recent bill, H. R. 394, 88th Cong., reflect the belief that those decisions upon which the Government now relies \"would appear to be contrary to the legislative purpose which gave the trustee all the rights of an ideal judicial lien creditor.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\nIn light of these legislative materials - the adoption of the phrase \"judgment creditor\" in both statutes, the legislative broadening of 70c in 1950, and the expressions of congressional discontent with recent decisions excluding the trustee from 6323 - we are persuaded that, read together, 6323 and 70c entitle the trustee to prevail over unrecorded federal tax liens.\n\nThe Government seeks to ward off this result with the argument that so to read the statutes is to confer upon certain classes of creditors \"windfalls\" unwarranted by the equities of their situation. The question may, however, be stated less invidiously than the argument indicates: it is whether the Government, unlike other creditors, and contrary to the general policy against secret liens, should be given advantage of a lien which it has not recorded as of the date of bankruptcy.\n18\n It is true that the consequence of depriving the United States of claimed priority for its secret lien is to improve the relative position of creditors - if there are any not already protected by 6323 - whose security was obtained subsequent to the Government's lien and who, once the federal lien is invalidated, have a prior claim to \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 276]\n\u00a0\n the secured assets. And our decision will enhance the possibility that there will be something in the bankrupt's estate for those claimants whose priorities are higher than that afforded unsecured tax claims,\n19\n as well as for state and local tax claims which share with the Federal Government the priority in 64a (4), 11 U.S.C. 104 (a) (4). Whether this result is inadvisable need not detain us,\n20\n for the question is one of policy which in our view has been decided by Congress in favor of the trustee. In any event, it is possible for the Government in cases which it deems appropriate, to avoid a result which it regards with unhappiness by promptly filing notice of its lien.\n21\n Should experience indicate that inclusion \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 277]\n\u00a0\n of the trustee within 6323 is inadvisable, the fact will not be lost upon Congress.\n\nThe Government advances one last and quite novel\n22\n argument predicated upon 67b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 107 (b) (1964 ed.), which provides:\n\n\"The provisions of section 60 of this Act to the contrary notwithstanding, statutory liens [including those] for taxes and debts owing to the United States or to any State or any subdivision thereof . . . may be valid against the trustee, even though arising or perfected while the debtor is insolvent and within four months prior to the filing of the petition . . . . Where by such laws such liens are required to be perfected and arise but are not perfected before bankruptcy, they may nevertheless be valid, if perfected within the time permitted by and in accordance with the requirements of such laws . . . .\" \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The contention is that the lower court's reading of 70c and 6323 cannot be correct, for it precludes the possibility which appears to be contemplated by 67b - that a federal tax lien not perfected until after bankruptcy may nevertheless be \"valid against the trustee.\" We find no such inconsistency. The purpose of 67b, insofar as tax claims are concerned, is to protect them from 60, 11 U.S.C. 96 (1964 ed.), which permits the trustee to avoid transfers made within four months of bankruptcy. Thus 67b permits an otherwise inchoate federal tax claim to be \"perfected\" by assessment and demand within the four months prior to bankruptcy or afterwards.\n23\n It does not nullify or purport to nullify the consequences which flow from the Government's failure to file its perfected lien prior to the date when the trustee's rights as a statutory judgment creditor attach - namely, on filing of the petition in bankruptcy.\n24\n There is no indication in the language of 67b, in the legislative history, or in decisions of any court, that the subsection was intended to affect the construction or application of 6323. In any event, we should hesitate to read 67b as relevant to the relationship between 70c and 6323, for Congress in the very legislation proposed to clarify the trustee's rights under 6323 did consider 67b, and evidenced no awareness of interrelationship or of inconsistency.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 U.S.C. 6321 (1964 ed.) provides: \"If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\"\n\n26 U.S.C. 6322 (1964 ed.) provides: \"Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien imposed by section 6321 shall arise at the time the assessment is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In its brief in the Court of Appeals the Government for the first time stated that notice of the lien was in fact filed with the Recorder on February 9, 1961. The statement in the referee's certificate that notice of the lien was never filed was not controverted in the District Court and, as respondent contends, there is no proof of the February filing in the record.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See 64a (1)-(3), 11 U.S.C. 104 (a) (1)-(3) (1964 ed.).

Moreover, in holding that under our `decisions' and in `this jurisdiction' the Town's tax assessments are `judgments,' the court below failed to give sufficient heed to the repeated declarations of this Court that the federal revenue laws should be interpreted `so as to give a uniform application to a nationwide scheme of taxation,' and hence their provisions are not to be deemed subject to state law unless the language of the section involved, expressly or by necessary implication, so requires.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Act of June 25, 1910, c. 412, 36 Stat. 840, 8, provided in part: \"such trustees, as to all property in the custody or coming into the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings thereon; and also, as to all property not in the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a judgment creditor holding an execution duly returned unsatisfied.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Act of March 4, 1913, c. 166, 37 Stat. 1016.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Act of March 18, 1950, c. 70, 2, 64 Stat. 26, now 11 U.S.C. 110 (c) (1964 ed.).

And in some circumstances administrative expense and wage claimants would in any case prevail over the Government's lien. See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] We note that failure of the Government to record its lien may work a hardship upon persons subsequently extending credit in ignorance of the unrecorded lien, and that nondisclosure may induce others to incur administrative or other expenses which they would not incur if there were no hope of repayment. Moreover, state and local governments might reduce their claims to judgment if they knew of the existence of a federal lien. See Memorandum of Chairman, Drafting Committee of National Bankruptcy Conference, contained in S. Rep. No. 1133, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., to accompany H. R. 394, pp. 24-25.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] In its letter to Senator Eastland opposing H. R. 394, dated September 8, 1961, the Treasury asserted that \"The Service has, as a matter of administrative practice, exercised forbearance as a creditor in cases when there exists a reasonable possibility that the business can regain financial stability. Enactment of the proposed amendments . . . could well force the service to change this practice, which it is believed has been proved by experience to be highly desirable.\" S. Rep. No. 1133, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18. This same argument was made to an earlier Congress and rejected. See letter from Treasury, dated Aug. 9, 1960, in opposition to H. R. 7242, contained in S. Rep. No. 1871, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 36.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] In the Court of Appeals the Government advanced, as an alternative basis for disposition of the case, the contention that pursuant to 67b the alleged filing of notice in February of 1961 retroactively validated the lien as against the trustee. The court declined to reach the merits of this claim, noting that it had not been presented either to the referee or to the District Court and that there was no proof of record with respect to the alleged February filing. 335 F.2d, at 314.\n\nThe 67b argument raised in this Court differs from that rejected below, for that subsection is now cited to us as an aid in construing the relationship between 70c and 6323. Insofar as it is relevant to the particular problem of statutory construction presented by this case, we regard the 67b argument as properly before us, for \"Where the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived.\" United States v.

JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nSection 6323 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provides that an unfiled tax lien is not \"valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 279]\n\u00a0\n . . . .\" The Court here holds that a bankruptcy trustee must be treated as if he were a \"judgment creditor\" thereby reducing government tax claims to the level of unsecured creditors. I am unable to agree. A bankruptcy trustee cannot be treated as a judgment creditor except by giving that term an entirely artificial, fictional meaning. The Court justifies this extraordinary twist of meaning by reference to 70c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 110 (c) (1964 ed.). That section, so far as here pertinent, provides:\n\n \"c. . . . The trustee, as to all property, whether or not coming into possession or control of the court, upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the date of bankruptcy, shall be deemed vested as of such date with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings, whether or not such a creditor actually exists.\"\n\n\n This language gives no intimation of a purpose to destroy a valid tax lien such as the Government had here when bankruptcy occurred. The section's terms simply show a purpose to make sure that all the property the bankrupt had before bankruptcy will be vested in the trustee. It stretches this language entirely too much to say it was intended to change the law so drastically that the mere appointment of a trustee could render invalid a government tax lien which was perfectly valid the moment before bankruptcy. Nor can this section fairly be read as an attempt by Congress to nullify valid government tax liens by placing the claims of all unsecured creditors of the bankrupt on the same level as valid tax liens. In writing 70c Congress was amending the bankruptcy law, not the government tax lien law that dates back nearly 100 years. I still think, as we said in United States v. Gilbert Associates, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 280]\n\u00a0\n \n345 \nU.S. 361, 364\n, that in enacting the predecessor of 6323 Congress used the words \"judgment creditor\" in \"the usual, conventional sense of a judgment of a court of record . . . .\" The Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have so construed this section. I think they were right. The Court today gives frail and inadequate support, I think, for its judicial destruction of the Government's congressionally created lien.\n\nI would reverse this judgment. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 266, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","220":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. VENTRESCA(1965)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1965\n\n\n\n\n An Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division Investigator made an affidavit stating his belief, on the basis of his own observations and the observations and investigation of other Investigators, that there was an illegal distillery operation in respondent's house. The affidavit described different occasions when a car was driven to the rear of respondent's house with loads of sugar or empty tins; the loading at the house of apparently full five-gallon cans; the smelling by Investigators as they walked in front of the house of fermenting mash; and their hearing the sound of a motor pump and metallic noises from the direction of the house. A Commissioner issued a search warrant on the basis of the affidavit, pursuant to which a still was found for the illegal possession and operation of which respondent was convicted. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, holding the warrant insufficient to establish probable cause. Held: The affidavit amply showed facts to establish probable cause to support the Commissioner's issuance of the search warrant. Pp. 105-111.\n\n (a) In a doubtful or marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fall. Pp. 106-107.\n\n\n (b) An affidavit for a search warrant may be based on hearsay information so long as the magistrate is informed of some of the underlying circumstances supporting the affiant's conclusions and his belief that any informant involved, whose identity need not be disclosed, was credible or his information reliable. Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108\n, followed. P. 108.\n\n\n (c) Though in order for a magistrate to perform his detached function of determining probable cause an affidavit must recite the underlying circumstances and not mere conclusions as to probable cause, the affidavit must be tested in a commonsense way. Pp. 108-109.\n\n\n (d) Since a fair reading of the whole affidavit, which is detailed and specific, setting forth many of the underlying circumstances, reveals that its conclusions are substantially based upon observations \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n of government officers, probable cause for the issuance of a warrant was shown. Pp. 110-111.\n\n\n 324 F.2d 864, reversed.\n\nFrank I. Goodman argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Beatrice Rosenberg and Ronald L. Gainer.\n\nMatthew R. McCann argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Edward C. Maher.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nRespondent, Ventresca, was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts of possessing and operating an illegal distillery. The conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting) on the ground that the affidavit for a search warrant pursuant to which the still was found was insufficient to establish probable cause. 324 F.2d 864.\n\nThe affidavit upon which the warrant was issued was made and submitted to a United States Commissioner on August 31, 1961, by Walter Mazaka, an Investigator for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service. He stated that he had reason to believe that an illegal distillery was in operation in respondent, Ventresca's, house at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. The grounds for this belief were set forth in detail in the affidavit, prefaced with the following statement:\n\n \"Based upon observations made by me, and based upon information received officially from other Investigators attached to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division assigned to this investigation, and reports orally made to me describing the results of their \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n observations and investigation, this request for the issuance of a search warrant is made.\"\n\n\n The affidavit then described seven different occasions between July 28 and August 30, 1961, when a Pontiac car was driven into the yard to the rear of Ventresca's house. On four occasions the car carried loads of sugar in 60-pound bags; it made two trips loaded with empty tin cans; and once it was merely observed as being heavily laden. Garry, the car's owner, and Incardone, a passenger, were seen on several occasions loading the car at Ventresca's house and later unloading apparently full five-gallon cans at Garry's house late in the evening. On August 28, after a delivery of empty tin cans to Ventresca's house, Garry and Incardone were observed carrying from the house cans which appeared to be filled and placing them in the trunk of Garry's car. The affidavit went on to state that at about 4 a. m. on August 18, and at about 4 a. m. on August 30, \"Investigators\" smelled the odor of fermenting mash as they walked along the sidewalk in front of Ventresca's house. On August 18 they heard, \"[a]t or about the same time, . . . certain metallic noises.\" On August 30, the day before the warrant was applied for, they heard (as they smelled the mash) \"sounds similar to that of a motor or a pump coming from the direction of\" Ventresca's house. The affidavit concluded: \"The foregoing information is based upon personal knowledge and information which has been obtained from Investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Internal Revenue Service, who have been assigned to this investigation.\"\n\nThe District Court upheld the validity of the warrant on a motion to suppress. The divided Court of Appeals held the warrant insufficient because it read the affidavit as not specifically stating in so many words that the information it contained was based upon the personal knowledge of Mazaka or other reliable investigators. The \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals reasoned that all of the information recited in the affidavit might conceivably have been obtained by investigators other than Mazaka, and it could not be certain that the information of these other investigators was not in turn based upon hearsay received from unreliable informants rather than their own personal observations. For this reason the court found that probable cause had not been established. 324 F.2d, at 868-870. We granted certiorari to consider the standards by which a reviewing court should approach the interpretation of affidavits supporting warrants which have been duly issued by examining magistrates. \n377 \nU.S. 989\n. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Fourth Amendment states:\n\n \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause. supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n We begin our analysis of this constitutional rule mindful of the fact that in this case a search was made pursuant to a search warrant. In discussing the Fourth Amendment policy against unnecessary invasions of privacy, we stated in Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108\n:\n\n \"An evaluation of the constitutionality of a search warrant should begin with the rule that `the informed and deliberate determinations of magistrates empowered to issue warrants . . . are to be preferred \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n over the hurried action of officers . . . who may happen to make arrests.' United States v. Lefkowitz, \n285 \nU.S. 452, 464\n. The reasons for this rule go to the foundations of the Fourth Amendment.\" \n378 \nU.S., at 110\n-111.\n\n\n In Jones v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 257, 270\n, this Court, strongly supporting the preference to be accorded searches under a warrant, indicated that in a doubtful or marginal case a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fall. In Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10\n, and Chapman v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 610\n, the Court, in condemning searches by officers who invaded premises without a warrant, plainly intimated that had the proper course of obtaining a warrant from a magistrate been followed and had the magistrate on the same evidence available to the police made a finding of probable cause, the search under the warrant would have been sustained. Mr. Justice Jackson stated for the Court in Johnson:\n\n \"The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate's disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people's homes secure only in the discretion of police officers.\" Johnson v. United States, supra, at 13-14.\n\n\n The fact that exceptions to the requirement that searches and seizures be undertaken only after obtaining a warrant \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n are limited\n2\n underscores the preference accorded police action taken under a warrant as against searches and seizures without one.\n\nWhile a warrant may issue only upon a finding of \"probable cause,\" this Court has long held that \"the term `probable cause' . . . means less than evidence which would justify condemnation,\" Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 348, and that a finding of \"probable cause\" may rest upon evidence which is not legally competent in a criminal trial. Draper v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 307, 311\n. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n As the Court stated in Brinegar v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 160, 173\n, \"There is a large difference between the two things to be proved [guilt and probable cause], as well as between the tribunals which determine them, and therefore a like difference in the quanta and modes of proof required to establish them.\" Thus hearsay may be the basis for issuance of the warrant \"so long as there [is] a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay.\" Jones v. United States, supra, at 272. And, in Aguilar we recognized that \"an affidavit may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant,\" so long as the magistrate is \"informed of some of the underlying circumstances\" supporting the affiant's conclusions and his belief that any informant involved \"whose identity need not be disclosed . . . was `credible' or his information `reliable.'\" Aguilar v. Texas, supra, at 114.\n\nThese decisions reflect the recognition that the Fourth Amendment's commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. If the teachings of the Court's cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants, such as the one involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.\n\nThis is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant's or an informer's belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the \"underlying circumstances\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n upon which that belief is based. See Aguilar v. Texas, supra. Recital of some of the underlying circumstances in the affidavit is essential if the magistrate is to perform his detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police. However, where these circumstances are detailed, where reason for crediting the source of the information is given, and when a magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner. Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants. Jones v. United States, supra, at 270.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe application of the principles stated above leads us to reverse the Court of Appeals. The affidavit in this case, if read in a commonsense way rather than technically, shows ample facts to establish probable cause and allow the Commissioner to issue the search warrant. The affidavit at issue here, unlike the affidavit held insufficient in Aguilar, is detailed and specific. It sets forth not merely \"some of the underlying circumstances\" supporting the officer's belief, but a good many of them. This is apparent from the summary of the affidavit already recited and from its text which is reproduced in the Appendix.\n\nThe Court of Appeals did not question the specificity of the affidavit. It rested its holding that the affidavit was insufficient on the ground that \"[t]he affidavit failed to clearly indicate which of the facts alleged therein were hearsay or which were within the affiant's own knowledge,\" and therefore \"[t]he Commissioner could only conclude that the entire affidavit was based on hearsay.\" \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n 324 F.2d, at 868. While the Court of Appeals recognized that an affidavit based on hearsay will be sufficient, \"so long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented,\" Jones v. United States, supra, at 269, it felt that no such basis existed here because the hearsay consisted of reports by \"Investigators,\" and the affidavit did not recite how the Investigators obtained their information. The Court of Appeals conceded that the affidavit stated that the Investigators themselves smelled the odor of fermenting mash, but argued that the rest of their information might itself have been based upon hearsay thus raising \"the distinct possibility of hearsay-upon-hearsay.\" 324 F.2d, at 869. For this reason, it held that the affidavit did not establish probable cause.\n\nWe disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals. Its determination that the affidavit might have been based wholly upon hearsay cannot be supported in light of the fact that Mazaka, a Government Investigator, swore under oath that the relevant information was in part based \"upon observations made by me\" and \"upon personal knowledge\" as well as upon \"information which has been obtained from Investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Internal Revenue Service, who have been assigned to this investigation.\" It also seems to us that the assumption of the Court of Appeals that all of the information in Mazaka's affidavit may in fact have come from unreliable anonymous informers, passed on to Government Investigators, who in turn related this information to Mazaka is without foundation. Mazaka swore that, insofar as the affidavit was not based upon his own observations, it was \"based upon information received officially from other Investigators attached to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division assigned to this investigation, and reports orally made to me describing the results of their observations and investigation.\" (Emphasis \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n added.) The Court of Appeals itself recognized that the affidavit stated that \"`Investigators' [employees of the Service] smelled the odor of fermenting mash in the vicinity of the suspected dwelling.\" 324 F.2d, at 869. A qualified officer's detection of the smell of mash has often been held a very strong factor in determining that probable cause exists so as to allow issuance of a warrant.\n3\n Moreover, upon reading the affidavit as a whole, it becomes clear that the detailed observations recounted in the affidavit cannot fairly be regarded as having been made in any significant part by persons other than full-time Investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service. Observations of fellow officers of the Government engaged in a common investigation are plainly a reliable basis for a warrant applied for by one of their number.\n4\n We conclude that the affidavit showed probable cause and that the Court of Appeals misapprehended its judicial function in reviewing this affidavit by giving it an unduly technical and restrictive reading.\n\nThis Court is alert to invalidate unconstitutional searches and seizures whether with or without a warrant. See Aguilar v. Texas, supra; Stanford v. Texas, \n379 \nU.S. 476\n; Preston v. United States, \n376 \nU.S. 364\n; Beck v. Ohio, \n379 \nU.S. 89\n. By doing so, it vindicates individual liberties and strengthens the administration of justice by promoting respect for law and order. This Court is equally concerned to uphold the actions of law \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n enforcement officers consistently following the proper constitutional course. This is no less important to the administration of justice than the invalidation of convictions because of disregard of individual rights or official overreaching. In our view the officers in this case did what the Constitution requires. They obtained a warrant from a judicial officer \"upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the . . . things to be seized.\" It is vital that having done so their actions should be sustained under a system of justice responsive both to the needs of individual liberty and to the rights of the community.\n\n       Reversed.\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n  AFFIDAVIT FOR SEARCH WARRANT\n\n\n BEFORE W. ARTHUR GARRITY, Worcester, Massachusetts The undersigned being duly sworn deposes and says:\n\nThat he has reason to believe that on the premises known as a one-family light green wooden frame dwelling house located at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, Worcester, occupied by Giacomo Ventresca and his family, together with all approaches and appurtenances thereto, in the District of Massachusetts, there is now being concealed certain property, namely an unknown quantity of material and certain apparatus, articles and devices, including a still and distilling apparatus setup with all attachments thereto, together with an unknown quantity of mash, an unknown quantity of distilled spirits, and other material used in the manufacture of non-tax-paid liquors; which are being held and possessed, and which have been used and are intended for use, in the distillation, manufacture, possession, and distribution of non-tax-paid liquors, in violation of the provisions of 26 USC 5171 (a), 5173, 5178, 5179 (a), 5222 (a), 5602, and 5686. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 113]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that the facts tending to establish the foregoing grounds for issuance of a Search Warrant are as follows:\n\nSEE ATTACHED SHEET\n\n   \/s\/ WALTER A. MAZAKA    Investigator, Alcohol and    Tobacco Tax Div., Internal    Revenue Service\n\n\n Sworn to before me, and subscribed in my presence, August 31st, 1961\n\n\n\n   \/s\/ W. ARTHUR GARRITY   United States Commissioner\n\n\n Based upon observations made by me, and based upon information received officially from other Investigators attached to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division assigned to this investigation, and reports orally made to me describing the results of their observations and investigation, this request for the issuance of a search warrant is made.\n\nOn or about July 28, 1961, about 6:45 P.M., an observation was made covering a Pontiac automobile owned by one Joseph Garry. Garry and one Joseph Incardone put thirteen bags of sugar into the car. These bags of sugar weighed sixty pounds each. Ten such bags were put into the trunk, and three were placed in the rear seat. Those in the rear seat were marked \"Domino.\" The others appeared to have similar markings. After the sugar was loaded into the car, Garry together with Incardone drove it to the vicinity of 148 Coburn Avenue, Worcester, Massachusetts, where the car was parked. Sometime later, the car with its contents was driven into the yard to the rear of 148 and between the premises 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. After remaining there about twentyfive minutes, the same two men drove in the direction of Boston. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn August 2, 1961 a Pontiac car owned by Garry, and driven by Garry with Incardone as a passenger, was followed from Boston to Worcester. The car appeared heavily laden. The car was again driven into the driveway at 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue to the rear of the yard and between the above-numbered houses.\n\nOn August 7, 1961 at least six sixty-pound bags of Domino Sugar were loaded into the Pontiac owned by Garry. The loading was done by Garry and Incardone. The car traveled from Boston to Worcester, then to Holden, and returned with its contents and entered the driveway at 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, where the car was parked at the rear between the two houses.\n\nOn August 11, 1961 new empty metal or tin cans were transferred from a car owned by Incardone to the Pontiac owned by Garry on Highland Street in Hyde Park. The Pontiac was driven by Garry with Incardone as a passenger to Worcester, and into the yard at 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue to the rear and between the two numbered premises.\n\nOn August 16, 1961 the Pontiac was observed. In the back seat bags of sugar were observed covered with a cloth or tarpaulin. A sixty-pound bag of sugar was on the front seat. Garry was observed after loading the above-described sugar into the car placing a carton with various five-pound bags of sugar on the top of the tarpaulin. The car was then driven by Garry with Incardone as a passenger to Worcester together with its contents into the yard at 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue to the rear of and between the two houses. About Midnight on the same night, the Pontiac driven by Garry with Incardone as a passenger was seen pulling up to the premises at 59 Highland Street, Hyde Park, where Garry lives. Garry opened the trunk of his car, and removed ten five-gallon cans therefrom, and placed them on the sidewalk. He then entered the house, and opened a door on the side. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 115]\n\u00a0\n Incardone made five trips from the sidewalk to the side of the house carrying two five-gallon cans on each such trip. It appeared that the cans were filled. On each of these trips, Incardone passed the two cans to someone standing in the doorway. Immediately after the fifth such trip, Garry came out of the door and joined Incardone. They walked to the sidewalk, and talked for a few moments. Incardone then drove away, and Garry went into his home.\n\nOn August 18, 1961 Investigators smelled an odor of fermenting mash on two occasions between 4:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. The first such odor was detected as they walked along the sidewalk in front of 148 Coburn Avenue, and the second such odor was detected from the side of 148 Coburn Avenue. At or about the same time, the Investigators heard certain metallic noises which cannot be further identified by source or sound.\n\nOn August 24, 1961 the Pontiac was observed parked at a bowling alley and coffee shop off Route 9. The back of the car contained what appeared to be boxes covered by a cloth or tarpaulin, but which cannot be more specifically identified. On the front seat of the car was observed a sixty-pound bag of Revere Sugar. Garry and Incardone were observed in the restaurant or coffee shop eating. Later the car was seen driven to the rear of 148 between 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, Worcester.\n\nAbout Midnight the Pontiac was observed pulling up in front of Garry's house at 59 Highland Street, Hyde Park. Garry was driving, and Incardone was a passenger. They both got out of the car. Garry opened the trunk, and then entered his house. From the trunk of the car there was removed eleven five-gallon cans which appeared to be filled. Incardone made six trips to a door on the side of the house. He carried two five-gallon cans on each trip, except the sixth trip. On that trip he carried one can, having passed the others to somebody in the door-way, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 116]\n\u00a0\n and on the last trip he entered the house. He remained there at least forty-five minutes, and was not observed to leave.\n\nOn August 28, 1961 Garry drove Incardone in his car to Worcester. On Lake Ave. they met Giacomo Ventresca, who lives at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, Worcester. Ventresca entered the car driven by Garry. The car was then driven into the yard to the rear of 148 and between 148 and 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. An observation was made that empty metal cans, five-gallon size, were being taken from the car owned by Garry, and brought into the premises at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, which was occupied by Ventresca. Later, new cans similar in size, shape and appearance were observed being placed into the trunk of Garry's car while parked at the rear of 148 and in front of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. The manner in which the cans were handled, and the sound[s] which were heard during the handling of these cans, were consistent with that of cans containing liquid.\n\nOn August 30, 1961, at about 4:00 A.M., an odor of fermenting mash was detected while Investigators were walking on the sidewalk in front of 148 Coburn Avenue. At the same time, they heard sounds similar to that of a motor or a pump coming from the direction of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue.\n\nThe foregoing information is based upon personal knowledge and information which has been obtained from Investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Internal Revenue Service, who have been assigned to this investigation.\n\n   \/s\/ WALTER A. MAZAKA\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Fourth Amendment's policy against unreasonable searches and seizures finds expression in Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The exceptions are illustrated by cases in which \"seizure is impossible except without warrant,\" Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 156\n, such as a search of a moving object where \"it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought,\" Carroll v. United States, supra, at 153, and those in which search is incident to a lawful arrest. This latter exception is itself a limited one. We stated in Preston v. United States, \n376 \nU.S. 364\n: \"Unquestionably, when a person is lawfully arrested, the police have the right, without a search warrant, to make a contemporaneous search of the person of the accused for weapons or for the fruits of or implements used to commit the crime. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 392\n (1914); Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 30\n (1925). This right to search and seize without a search warrant extends to things under the accused's immediate control, Carroll v. United States, supra, \n267 \nU.S., at 158\n, and, to an extent depending on the circumstances of the case, to the place where he is arrested, Agnello v. United States, supra, \n269 \nU.S., at 30\n; Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192, 199\n (1927); United States v. Rabinowitz, \n339 \nU.S. 56, 61\n-62 (1950). The rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified, for example, by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime - things which might easily happen where the weapon or evidence is on the accused's person or under his immediate control. But these justifications are absent where a search is remote in time or place from the arrest. Once an accused is under arrest and in custody, then a search made at another place, without a warrant, is simply not incident to the arrest.\" \n376 \nU.S., at 367\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Monnette v. United States, 299 F.2d 847, 850 (C. A. 5th Cir.). Cf. Chapman v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 610\n; Steeber v. United States, 198 F.2d 615, 616, 618 (C. A. 10th Cir.); United States v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting.\n\nWith all deference, the present affidavit seems hopelessly inadequate to me as a basis for a magistrate's \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 117]\n\u00a0\n informed determination that a search warrant should issue.\n\nWe deal with the constitutional right of privacy that can be invaded only on a showing of \"probable cause\" as provided by the Fourth Amendment. That is a strict standard; what the police say does not necessarily carry the day; \"probable cause\" is in the keeping of the magistrate. Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480, 486\n-487; Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 14\n. Yet anything he says does not necessarily go either. He too is bound by the Constitution. His discretion is reviewable. Aguilar v. Texas, \n378 \nU.S. 108, 111\n. But unless the constitutional standard of \"probable cause\" is defined in meticulous ways, the discretion of police and of magistrates alike will become absolute. The present case, illustrates how the mere weight of lengthy and vague recitals takes the place of reasonably probative evidence of the existence of crime.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nInvestigator Mazaka sought a warrant for the purpose of searching the premises at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, occupied by respondent and his family, because, he averred, he had reason to believe that there was concealed on the premises an illegal still and other material connected with the manufacture of nontax-paid liquors. The grounds for this belief were recited in 12 paragraphs on an attached sheet, as reproduced in the Appendix to the Court's opinion, ante, p. 112.\n\nThe factual recitals comprise 10 paragraphs, each paragraph setting forth the alleged events of a single day, except that August 24, 1961, is dealt with in two paragraphs. Of these factual recitals more will be said in a moment. The first and last paragraphs of the 12 describe the sources from which the affiant has gained the information set forth in the factual paragraphs. These sources are, according to the first paragraph, three in \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 118]\n\u00a0\n number: (1) \"observations made by me\"; (2) \"information received officially from other Investigators\"; and (3) \"reports orally made to me [by other investigators] describing the results of their observations and investigation.\" In the last paragraph the affiant describes the sources of his information slightly differently: \"The foregoing information is based upon personal knowledge and information which has been obtained from Investigators . . . .\"\n\nOf the 10 factual paragraphs eight describe trips said to have been made to and from the vicinity of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue by one Garry and one Incardone. On these trips, it is said, there were delivered to the vicinity of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue large quantities of sugar (four deliveries) and empty metal cans (two deliveries, on one of which respondent himself is said to have been a passenger in the car); on one occasion it was observed only that the car was \"heavily laden.\" It is said that on two occasions Garry and Incardone were seen taking apparently filled cans into Garry's house, 59 Highland Street, from the Pontiac; on one such occasion the Pontiac, it is said, had been at Coburn Avenue earlier in the day, apparently making a sugar delivery. And, finally, it is averred that on one occasion seemingly filled cans were loaded into the Pontiac near 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue, shortly after a delivery of empties to that address.\n\nThe \"facts\" recited in these eight paragraphs, it is said, permit the inference that a still was being operated on respondent's premises. But are these \"facts\" really facts? A statement of \"fact\" is only as credible as its source. Investigator Mazaka evidently believes these statements to be correct; but the magistrate must, of course, know something of the basis of that belief. Nathanson v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 41\n. Is the belief of this affiant based on personal observation, or on hearsay, or on hearsay on hearsay? Nowhere in the affidavit is the source \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 119]\n\u00a0\n of these eight paragraphs of information revealed. In each paragraph the alleged events are simply described directly, or else it is said that certain events \"were observed.\" Scarcely a clue is given as to who the observer might have been. It might have been the affiant, though one would not expect that he would so studiously refrain from revealing that he himself witnessed these events. The observers might have been some other investigators, though the affiant does not say so; yet in the two paragraphs next to be discussed the observers are prominently identified as investigators. Perhaps the ultimate source of most of these statements was one or more private citizens, who were interviewed by investigators, whose reports on these interviews came in due course to Investigator Mazaka, who then composed the affidavit. Perhaps many of the \"facts\" recited in the affidavit were supplied by an unknown informant over the telephone.\n\nIn most instances the language of the affidavit suggests that some investigator witnessed the alleged events. For example, the second paragraph begins: \"On or about July 28, 1961, about 6:45 P. M., an observation was made covering a Pontiac automobile owned by one Joseph Garry.\" But the presumed investigator who may have been \"covering\" this automobile is in no way identified. There is no way of knowing whether the report of this alleged observation was made directly to the affiant or whether it went through one or more intermediaries.\n\nTurning now to the remaining two \"factual\" paragraphs, we find it averred that \"Investigators\" smelled fermenting mash and heard metallic and other noises in the vicinity of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. On August 18, it is said, investigators twice smelled mash between 4 and 5 a. m. as they walked on the sidewalk in front of and beside the house at 148 Coburn Avenue, which is apparently the house next to respondent's. The \"Investigators\" are not further identified. On August 30 at about 4 a. m., it \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 120]\n\u00a0\n is averred, unidentified investigators detected the odor of fermenting mash while they were \"walking on the sidewalk in front of 148 Coburn Avenue.\" The source of the odor is again not specified; but sounds heard at the same time, similar to the sounds made by \"a motor or a pump,\" are stated to have come \"from the direction of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue.\"\n\nSuch is the substance of the affidavit. No particular item of information is identified as within the first-hand knowledge of the affiant. Certain smells and sounds are explicitly described as having been directly perceived by unnamed investigators. The sources of all the other information are left to speculation.\n\nThe Court's unconcern over the failure of the affidavit to identify the sources of the information recited seems based in part on the detailed, lengthy nature of the factual recitals. The Court seems to say that even if we assume that only some small part of the information is trustworthy, still enough remains to establish probable cause. But I would direct attention to the fact that only one of the 12 paragraphs in this affidavit definitely points the finger of suspicion at 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue: that is the paragraph describing the alleged events of August 28, 1961. In every other paragraph the recitals point no more to 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue than they do to 148 Coburn Avenue. The August 28 paragraph is critical to the finding of the existence of probable cause for the search of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. Yet the source of the information contained in that paragraph is in no way identified and it is therefore impossible to determine the trust-worthiness of that crucial information.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nA discussion of the legal principles governing the sufficiency of this affidavit must, unhappily, begin with Draper v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 307\n. There an officer \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 121]\n\u00a0\n had been told by an informer, known to the officer to be reliable, that a man of a certain description would get off a certain train with heroin in his possession. The officer met the train, observed a man of that description getting off, and arrested him. The Court held that there was probable cause for the arrest. In Jones v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 257\n, the Court applied the holding in Draper to find an affidavit sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant, even though the facts stated in the affidavit did not rest on the affiant's personal observations but rather on the observations of another. The Court held that an affidavit could rest on hearsay, \"so long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented.\" Id., at 269. (Emphasis supplied.) In Jones the basis for crediting the informant's hearsay was: (1) the affiant swore that the informant had previously given information to him which was correct; (2) the affiant had been given corroborating information by other informants; and (3) the affiant was independently familiar with the persons claimed by the informants to be concealing narcotics in their apartment, and he knew them to have admitted to the use of narcotics.\n\nI dissented from the decisions of the Court in these two cases, for the reasons which I set forth most fully in Draper, supra, at 314 et seq. But though I regard these decisions\n*\n as taking a view destructive of the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, they are in any event clearly not dispositive of the present case. As I have already shown, the affidavit here does not set forth a single corroborating \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 122]\n\u00a0\n fact that is sworn to be within the personal knowledge of the affiant. Moreover, there is not a single statement in the affidavit that could not well be hearsay on hearsay or some other multiple form of hearsay.\n\nWe are told, however, that it is at least clear that \"Investigators\" detected the smell of mash in the vicinity of 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue. And the Court says: \"Observations of fellow officers of the Government engaged in a common investigation are plainly a reliable basis for a warrant applied for by one of their number,\" ante, p. 111. But I would make Taylor v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, my starting point, where the Court stated: \"Prohibition officers may rely on a distinctive odor as a physical fact indicative of possible crime; but its presence alone does not strip the owner of a building of constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search.\" In Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 13\n, the Court explained what the decision in Taylor meant: \"That decision held only that odors alone do not authorize a search without warrant. If the presence of odors is testified to before a magistrate and he finds the affiant qualified to know the odor, and it is one sufficiently distinctive to identify a forbidden substance, this Court has never held such a basis insufficient to justify issuance of a search warrant.\" (Emphasis supplied.) It is hardly necessary to point out that a magistrate cannot begin to assess the odor-identifying qualifications of persons whose identity is unknown to him. Nor is it necessary to belabor the point that these odors of mash are not ever stated in the affidavit to have emanated from 148 1\/2 Coburn Avenue.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals was surely correct when it observed that \"the affidavit leaves as a complete mystery the manner in which the Investigators discovered their information.\" 324 F.2d 864, 869. Such being the case, \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 123]\n\u00a0\n I see no way to avoid the conclusion of the majority below: \"If hearsay evidence is to be relied upon in the preparation of an affidavit for a search warrant, the officer or attorney preparing such an affidavit should keep in mind that hearsay statements are only as credible as their source and only as strong as their corroboration. And where the source of the information is in doubt and the corroboration by the affiant is unclear, the affidavit is insufficient.\" Id., at 869-870. That conclusion states a relatively clear standard of probable cause and is in sharp contrast to the amorphous one upon which today's decision rests.\n\nIn Jones v. United States, supra, this Court forgot, as it forgets again today, that the duty of the magistrate is not delegable to the police. Nathanson v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 41\n. It is for the magistrate, not the police, to decide whether there is probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. That function cannot be discharged by the magistrate unless the police first discharge their own, different responsibility: \"to evidence what is reliable and why, and not to introduce a hodge-podge under some general formalistic coverall.\" 324 F.2d, at 870. And see Masiello v. United States, 304 F.2d 399, 401-402. That is the duty of the police - the rest is not for them.\n\nI would affirm the decision below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] In these cases we might have drawn a clear, unmistakable line and held that hearsay evidence could not support a search warrant. But we did not so hold; instead we held that hearsay was competent for this purpose if there was \"a substantial basis\" for crediting it, thereby muddying the waters with considerations of corroboration and informer's reliability. Thus, by forsaking precise standards, the discretion of police and magistrates became less subject to judicial control. \n\n[380 \nU.S. 102, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUTILITY COMM'N v.

Cousins for appellee.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nIn the three-judge District Court from which this appeal comes to us, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company sued to enjoin the enforcement of a duly promulgated order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on the sole ground that the order conflicted with a federal statute. The Commission, among other defenses, contended \n\n[382 \nU.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n that the federal statute was unconstitutional, but the District Court decided the case in favor of the railroad and issued an appropriate injunction. 240 F. Supp. 233.\n\nIt follows from our recent decision in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, ante, p. 111, that the injunction sought by the railroad, being based on incompatibility between the state order and the federal statute, was not grounded in the \"unconstitutionality\" of a state measure so as to require a three-judge tribunal under 28 U.S.C. 2281 (1964 ed.). Nor is 2282, requiring such a tribunal in order to enjoin \"any Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution,\" invoked by the Commission's defense that the federal statute is unconstitutional; it is settled that this provision \"does not provide for a case where the validity of an Act of Congress is merely drawn in question, albeit that question be decided, but only for a case where there is an application for an interlocutory or permanent injunction to restrain the enforcement of an Act of Congress.\" Garment Workers v. Donnelly Co., \n304 \nU.S. 243, 250\n.\n\nBecause a three-judge court was not required to adjudicate this suit, this Court has no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1253 (1964 ed.) to entertain a direct appeal. It does not appear from the record that the Commission lodged a protective appeal in the Court of Appeals, and the time to do so has almost certainly expired. The appeal to this Court occurred before Swift & Co. v. Wickham, supra, was decided, and there is no reason why the Commission should be deprived of appellate review. In accordance with precedent, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case to the District Court so that it may enter a fresh decree from which a timely appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals.

Petitioner then amended its counterclaim to charge that respondent had illegally monopolized commerce by having fraudulently and in bad faith obtained and maintained the patent in violation of the antitrust laws, and sought treble damages. The District Court dismissed the complaint and the counterclaim and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may violate 2 of the Sherman Act, provided all other elements to establish a 2 monopolization charge are proved, in which event the treble-damage provisions of 4 of the Clayton Act would be available to the injured party.

Friedman argued the cause for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. On the brief were Assistant Attorney General Orrick and Robert B. Hummel.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question before us is whether the maintenance and enforcement of a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent Office may be the basis of an action under 2 of the Sherman Act,\n1\n and therefore subject to a treble damage claim by an injured party under 4 of the Clayton Act.\n2\n The respondent, Food Machinery & Chemical Corp. (hereafter Food Machinery), filed this suit for infringement of its patent No. 2,328,655 covering knee-action swing diffusers used in aeration equipment for sewage treatment systems.\n3\n Petitioner, Walker Process Equipment, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n Inc. (hereafter Walker), denied the infringement and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid. After discovery, Food Machinery moved to dismiss its complaint with prejudice because the patent had expired. Walker then amended its counterclaim to charge that Food Machinery had \"illegally monopolized interstate and foreign commerce by fraudulently and in bad faith obtaining and maintaining . . . its patent . . . well knowing that it had no basis for . . . a patent.\" It alleged fraud on the basis that Food Machinery had sworn before the Patent Office that it neither knew nor believed that its invention had been in public use in the United States for more than one year prior to filing its patent application when, in fact, Food Machinery was a party to prior use within such time. The counterclaim further asserted that the existence of the patent had deprived Walker of business that it would have otherwise enjoyed. Walker prayed that Food Machinery's conduct be declared a violation of the antitrust laws and sought recovery of treble damages.\n\nThe District Court granted Food Machinery's motion and dismissed its infringement complaint along with Walker's amended counterclaim, without leave to amend and with prejudice. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 335 F.2d 315. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 957\n. We have concluded that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be violative of 2 of the Sherman Act provided the other elements necessary to a 2 case are present. In such event the treble damage provisions of 4 of the Clayton Act would be available to an injured party.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAs the case reaches us, the allegations of the counterclaim, as to the fraud practiced upon the Government by Food Machinery as well as the resulting damage suffered \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n by Walker, are taken as true.\n4\n We, therefore, move immediately to a consideration of the legal issues presented.\n\nBoth Walker and the United States, which appears as amicus curiae, argue that if Food Machinery obtained its patent by fraud and thereafter used the patent to exclude Walker from the market through \"threats of suit\" and prosecution of this infringement suit, such proof would establish a prima facie violation of 2 of the Sherman Act. On the other hand, Food Machinery says that a patent monopoly and a Sherman Act monopolization cannot be equated; the removal of the protection of a patent grant because of fraudulent procurement does not automatically result in a 2 offense. Both lower courts seem to have concluded that proof of fraudulent procurement may be used to bar recovery for infringement, Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., \n324 \nU.S. 806\n (1945), but not to establish invalidity. As the Court of Appeals expressed the proposition, \"only the government may `annual or set aside' a patent,\" citing Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 434 (1872). It went on to state that no case had \"decided, or hinted that fraud on the Patent Office may be turned to use in an original affirmative action, instead of as an equitable defense. . . . Since Walker admits that its anti-trust theory depends on its ability to prove fraud on the Patent Office, it follows that . . . Walker's second amended counterclaim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\" 335 F.2d, at 316.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe have concluded, first, that Walker's action is not barred by the rule that only the United States may sue to cancel or annul a patent. It is true that there is no \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n statutory authority for a private annulment suit and the invocation of the equitable powers of the court might often subject a patentee \"to innumerable vexatious suits to set aside his patent.\" Mowry, supra, at 441. But neither reason applies here. Walker counterclaimed under the Clayton Act, not the patent laws. While one of its elements is the fraudulent procurement of a patent, the action does not directly seek the patent's annulment. The gist of Walker's claim is that since Food Machinery obtained its patent by fraud it cannot enjoy the limited exception to the prohibitions of 2 of the Sherman Act, but must answer under that section and 4 of the Clayton Act in treble damages to those injured by any monopolistic action taken under the fraudulent patent claim. Nor can the interest in protecting patentees from \"innumerable vexatious suits\" be used to frustrate the assertion of rights conferred by the antitrust laws. It must be remembered that we deal only with a special class of patents, i. e., those procured by intentional fraud.\n\nUnder the decisions of this Court a person sued for infringement may challenge the validity of the patent on various grounds, including fraudulent procurement. E. g., Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., \n324 \nU.S. 806\n (1945); Hazel-Atlas Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., \n322 \nU.S. 238\n (1944); Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240\n (1933). In fact, one need not await the filing of a threatened suit by the patentee; the validity of the patent may be tested under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201 (1964 ed.). See Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O Two Fire Equipment Co., \n342 \nU.S. 180, 185\n (1952). At the same time, we have recognized that an injured party may attack the misuse of patent rights. See, e. g., Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., \n320 \nU.S. 661\n (1944). To permit recovery of treble damages for the fraudulent procurement of the patent \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 177]\n\u00a0\n coupled with violations of 2 accords with these long-recognized procedures. It would also promote the purposes so well expressed in Precision Instrument, supra, at 816:\n\n\"A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. . . . [It] is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the right to access to a free and open market. The far-reaching social and economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give the public a paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable conduct and that such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.\"\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWalker's counterclaim alleged that Food Machinery obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the Patent Office. Proof of this assertion would be sufficient to strip Food Machinery of its exemption from the antitrust laws.\n5\n By the same token, Food Machinery's good faith would furnish a complete defense. This includes an honest mistake as to the effect of prior installation upon patentability - so-called \"technical fraud.\"\n\nTo establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize a part of trade or commerce under 2 of the Sherman Act, it would then be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant market for the product involved. Without a definition of that market there is no way to measure Food Machinery's ability to lessen or destroy competition. It may be that the device - knee-action swing diffusers \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 178]\n\u00a0\n - used in sewage treatment systems does not comprise a relevant market. There may be effective substitutes for the device which do not infringe the patent. This is a matter of proof, as is the amount of damages suffered by Walker.\n\nAs respondent points out, Walker has not clearly articulated its claim. It appears to be based on a concept of per se illegality under 2 of the Sherman Act. But in these circumstances, the issue is premature. As the Court summarized in White Motor Co. v. United States, \n372 \nU.S. 253\n (1963), the area of per se illegality is carefully limited. We are reluctant to extend it on the bare pleadings and absent examination of market effect and economic consequences.\n\nHowever, even though the per se claim fails at this stage of litigation, we believe that the case should be remanded for Walker to clarify the asserted violations of 2 and to offer proof thereon. The trial court dismissed its suit not because Walker failed to allege the relevant market, the dominance of the patented device therein, and the injurious consequences to Walker of the patent's enforcement, but rather on the ground that the United States alone may \"annul or set aside\" a patent for fraud in procurement. The trial court has not analyzed any economic data. Indeed, no such proof has yet been offered because of the disposition below. In view of these considerations, as well as the novelty of the claim asserted and the paucity of guidelines available in the decided cases, this deficiency cannot be deemed crucial. Fairness requires that on remand Walker have the opportunity to make its 2 claims more specific, to prove the alleged fraud, and to establish the necessary elements of the asserted 2 violation.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 2 (1964 ed.):\n\n\"Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 15 (1964 ed.):\n\n\"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The patent in question was issued in the name of the inventor, Lannert.

New Wrinkle, Inc., \n342 \nU.S. 371, 376\n (1952).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This conclusion applies with equal force to an assignee who maintains and enforces the patent with knowledge of the patent's infirmity. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI join the Court's opinion. I deem it appropriate, however, to add a few comments to what my Brother CLARK has written because the issue decided is one of first impression and to allay possible misapprehension as to the possible reach of this decision.\n\nWe hold today that a treble-damage action for monopolization which, but for the existence of a patent, would be violative of 2 of the Sherman Act may be maintained under 4 of the Clayton Act if two conditions are satisfied: (1) the relevant patent is shown to have been procured by knowing and willful fraud practiced by the defendant on the Patent Office or, if the defendant was not the original patent applicant, he had been enforcing the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent manner in which it was obtained; and (2) all the elements otherwise necessary to establish a 2 monopolization charge are proved. Conversely, such a private cause of action would not be made out if the plaintiff: (1) showed no more than invalidity of the patent arising, for example, from a judicial finding of \"obviousness,\" or from other factors sometimes compendiously referred to as \"technical fraud\"; or (2) showed fraudulent procurement, but no knowledge thereof by the defendant; or (3) failed to prove the elements of a 2 charge even though he has established actual fraud in the procurement of the patent and the defendant's knowledge of that fraud.\n\nIt is well also to recognize the rationale underlying this decision, aimed of course at achieving a suitable accommodation in this area between the differing policies of the patent and antitrust laws. To hold, as we do, that private suits may be instituted under 4 of the Clayton Act to recover damages for Sherman Act monopolization knowingly practiced under the guise of a patent \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 180]\n\u00a0\n procured by deliberate fraud, cannot well be thought to impinge upon the policy of the patent laws to encourage inventions and their disclosure. Hence, as to this class of improper patent monopolies, antitrust remedies should be allowed room for full play. On the other hand, to hold, as we do not, that private antitrust suits might also reach monopolies practiced under patents that for one reason or another may turn out to be voidable under one or more of the numerous technicalities attending the issuance of a patent, might well chill the disclosure of inventions through the obtaining of a patent because of fear of the vexations or punitive consequences of treble-damage suits. Hence, this private antitrust remedy should not be deemed available to reach 2 monopolies carried on under a nonfraudulently procured patent.\n\nThese contrasting factors at once serve to justify our present holding and to mark the limits of its application. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 172, 181]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","225":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWARREN TRADING POST v. TAX COMM'N(1965)\nNo. 115\nArgued: March 9, 1965Decided: April 29, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Appellant, the operator of a retail trading post on the Navajo Indian Reservation under a license granted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 261, challenged the right of Arizona to levy a tax on its income from trading with reservation Indians on the reservation. The State Supreme Court upheld the tax. Held: Since Congress has broadly occupied the field of trading with Indians on reservations by all-inclusive regulations and statutes, the States may not impose additional burdens on the traders or the Indians, and therefore this tax may not be imposed on appellant. Pp. 686-692.\n\n 95 Ariz. 110, 387 P.2d 809, reversed and remanded.\n\nEdward Jacobson argued the cause and filed briefs for appellant.\n\nPhilip M.

Marks for the Association on American Indian Affairs. Inc., et al.; by Norman M. Littell and Leland O. Graham for the Navajo Tribe of Indians, and by Edward B. Berger for the Papago Tribe.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nArizona has levied a tax of 2% on the \"gross proceeds of sales, or gross income\" of appellant Warren Trading Post Company, which does a retail trading business with \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 686]\n\u00a0\n Indians on the Arizona part of the Navajo Indian Reservation under a license granted by the United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant to 19 Stat. 200, 25 U.S.C. 261 (1958 ed.).\n1\n Appellant claimed that as applied to its income from trading with reservation Indians on the reservation the state tax was invalid as (1) in violation of Art. I, 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, which provides that \"Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian Tribes\"; (2) inconsistent with the comprehensive congressional plan, enacted under authority of Art. I, 8, to regulate Indian trade and traders and to have Indian tribes on reservations govern themselves. The State Supreme Court rejected these contentions and upheld the tax, one Justice dissenting. 95 Ariz. 110, 387 P.2d 809. The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2) (1958 ed.). Since we hold that this state tax cannot be imposed consistently with federal statutes applicable to the Indians on the Navajo Reservation, we find it unnecessary to consider whether the tax is also barred by that part of the Commerce Clause giving Congress power to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes.\n\nThe Navajo Reservation was set apart as a \"permanent home\" for the Navajos in a treaty made with the \"Navajo nation or tribe of Indians\" on June 1, 1868.\n2\n Long before that, in fact from the very first days of our Government, the Federal Government had been permitting the Indians largely to govern themselves, free from state \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 687]\n\u00a0\n interference,\n3\n and had exercised through statutes and treaties\n4\n a sweeping and dominant control over persons who wished to trade with Indians and Indian tribes. As \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n Chief Justice John Marshall recognized in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 556-557:\n\n \"From the commencement of our government, congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians; which treat them as nations, respect their rights, and manifest a firm purpose to afford that protection which treaties stipulate.\"\n\n\n He went on to say that:\n\n \"The treaties and laws of the United States contemplate the Indian territory as completely separated from that of the states; and provide that all intercourse with them shall be carried on exclusively by the government of the union.\" Id., at 557.\n\n\n See also, e. g., United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, \n93 \nU.S. 188\n. In the very first volume of the federal statutes is found an Act, passed in 1790 by the first Congress, \"to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,\" requiring that Indian traders obtain a license from a federal official, and specifying in detail the conditions on which such licenses would be granted.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nSuch comprehensive federal regulation of Indian traders has continued from that day to this.\n6\n Existing statutes make specific restrictions on trade with the Indians,\n7\n and \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n one of them, passed in 1876 and tracing back to comprehensive enactments of 1802\n8\n and 1834,\n9\n provides that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall have \"the sole power and authority to appoint traders to the Indian tribes\" and to specify \"the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians.\"\n10\n Acting under authority of this statute and one added in 1901,\n11\n the Commissioner has promulgated detailed regulations prescribing in the most minute fashion who may qualify to be a trader and how he shall be licensed, penalties for acting as a trader without a license; conditions under which government employees may trade with Indians; articles that cannot be sold to Indians; and conduct forbidden on a licensed trader's premises.\n12\n He has ordered that detailed business records be kept and that government officials be allowed to inspect these records to make sure that prices charged are fair and reasonable; that traders pay Indians in money; that bonds be executed by proposed licensees; and that the governing body of an Indian reservation may assess from a trader \"such fees, etc., as it may deem appropriate.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 690]\n\u00a0\n It was under these comprehensive statutes and regulations that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs licensed appellant to trade with the Indians on the Navajo Reservation. These apparently all-inclusive regulations and the statutes authorizing them would seem in themselves sufficient to show that Congress has taken the business of Indian trading on reservations so fully in hand that no room remains for state laws imposing additional burdens upon traders.\n14\n In fact, the Solicitor's Office of the Department of the Interior in 1940\n15\n and again in 1943\n16\n interpreted these statutes to bar States from taxing federally licensed Indian traders on their sales to reservation Indians on a reservation. We think those rulings were correct.\n\nCongress has, since the creation of the Navajo Reservation nearly a century ago, left the Indians on it largely free to run the reservation and its affairs without state control, a policy which has automatically relieved Arizona of all burdens for carrying on those same responsibilities. And in compliance with its treaty obligations the Federal Government has provided for roads, education and other services needed by the Indians.\n17\n We \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 691]\n\u00a0\n think the assessment and collection of this tax would to a substantial extent frustrate the evident congressional purpose of ensuring that no burden shall be imposed upon Indian traders for trading with Indians on reservations except as authorized by Acts of Congress or by valid regulations promulgated under those Acts. This state tax on gross income would put financial burdens on appellant or the Indians with whom it deals in addition to those Congress or the tribes have prescribed, and could thereby disturb and disarrange the statutory plan Congress set up in order to protect Indians against prices deemed unfair or unreasonable by the Indian Commissioner. And since federal legislation has left the State with no duties or responsibilities respecting the reservation Indians, we cannot believe that Congress intended to leave to the State the privilege of levying this tax.\n18\n Insofar as they are applied to this federally licensed Indian trader with respect to sales made to reservation \n\n[380 \nU.S. 685, 692]\n\u00a0\n Indians on the reservation, these state laws imposing taxes cannot stand. Cf. Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S. 218\n. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ariz.

U.S.(1965)\nNo. 245\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1965\n\n\n\n\n During the period 1942-1946 petitioner purchased 18 government-built ships from the United States Maritime Commission for $46,973,167 after a trade-in allowance for four of its own ships. Petitioner then chartered the ships back to the Government, receiving $13,430,431 in charter hire, on which petitioner paid federal income taxes. The subsequently enacted Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 provided for sale of war-built ships well below the Commission's wartime prices. By treating wartime sales as made when the Act was passed, 9 afforded ship purchasers like petitioner an opportunity to apply for a downward adjustment by reducing the purchase price paid to the new statutory price and unwinding the wartime transactions, including tax payments. Section 9 (c) (1) required an applicant for adjustment to agree, inter alia, that pre-Act government charter hire received be treated for federal tax purposes as not having been received or accrued as income but as a repayment of the purchase price. Petitioner applied for and by agreement was given such an adjustment, the statutory sales price being fixed at $17,685,424 (giving petitioner a gross sales price adjustment of $29,287,743); and the unwinding of the pre-Act transactions left the Government a net credit after appropriate tax adjustments of $8,818,838, which reduced petitioner's net 1946 sales price adjustment to $20,468,904. In its federal income tax returns for 1947-1950 petitioner took depreciation on the vessels on the basis of the $17,685,424 statutory sales price, but in 1959 sued for a refund, contending that its real cost (and hence its basis for depreciation) was the difference, amounting to $26,504,263, between the original sales price and the net 1946 sales price adjustment credited to petitioner. The Government contended that under the statutory scheme petitioner's real cost was the $17,685,424 statutory sales price. The difference of $8,818,838 between the two figures was the net credit in the Government's favor received by petitioner in charter hire from the Government and which petitioner contended was received as income and therefore could not be taken to reduce its cost; while the Government, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n conceding that amount to have been originally received as income, contended that it had to be treated under the statutory unwinding scheme as a return of capital. The District Court upheld petitioner's position and the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: Under the Act the $8,818,838 net charter hire must be treated as a return of capital against petitioner's original purchase price of the ships which thus, along with the 1946 lump-sum payment to petitioner of $20,468,904, reduced petitioner's cost, and hence its basis for depreciation, to $17,685,424, the statutory sales price. Pp. 260-270.\n\n (a) To realize the statutory purpose of putting petitioner and the Government in the positions they would have occupied had the sales been made on the 1946 statutory enactment date petitioner had to refund the $8,818,838 net charter hire. P. 261.\n\n\n (b) Though petitioner received $20,468,904 in the form of a lump-sum payment as of 1946, it had also received $8,818,838 in 1942-1946 in government payments which but for its ownership of the ships (which the Act unwinds) it would not have received. P. 262.\n\n\n (c) As part of the statutory unwinding, petitioner's income taxes were recomputed on the statutory assumptions that it did not receive charter hire on the 18 ships bought from the Government in 1942-1946, but that it did receive charter hire on the four ships it traded in, and interest on its investment in the 18 ships. P. 263.\n\n\n (d) Petitioner's position would result in the anomaly that due to the unwinding operation it would pay no federal income taxes on the $8,818,838, which it claims is income. P. 264.\n\n\n (e) Petitioner's position that the original ship acquisition costs be adjusted to 1946 prices but that its costs as a basis for depreciation should relate back to the original acquisition dates contravenes the terms and legislative history of the Act, the date of whose enactment fixes the sales prices, and its purpose of putting pre-Act and post-Act purchasers \"on exactly the same basis.\" Pp. 264-266.\n\n\n (f) Congressional passage in 1950 of a \"clarifying\" amendment to the 1946 Act which would have provided the tax result urged by petitioner, vetoed by President Truman, would not supplant the contemporaneous intent of the Congress which enacted the statute. Fogarty v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 8\n, followed. Pp. 268-270.\n\n\n 330 F.2d 128, affirmed. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJohn W. McConnell, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner.

Maurice Fridlund and Leslie C. Krusen for American Merchant Marine Institute, Inc.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the tax consequences of the purchase by petitioner of a number of ships from the United States Government during the Second World War and the subsequent post-war refund by the Government, pursuant to an Act of Congress, of a substantial portion of the purchase price.\n\nAt various times during the years 1942 through 1946, petitioner purchased from the United States Maritime Commission a total of 18 ships that had been built by the United States Government. It paid a total of $46,973,167 for these vessels (after an allowance for the trade-in by petitioner of four of its own ships).\n1\n The vessels purchased by petitioner were immediately chartered back, by bareboat charters, to the United States so that the Government \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n continued to operate them.\n2\n The United States paid a total of $13,430,431 in charter hire to petitioner for the wartime use of these ships during the years 1942 through 1946, which amount petitioner reported in its federal income tax returns for those years.\n\nOn March 8, 1946, Congress enacted the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 41, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. 1735 et seq. (1958 ed.), which gave American citizens the right to purchase war-built ships from the United States at statutory sales prices which were substantially below the prices at which such vessels were sold by the Commission during the war. Section 9 of the Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 1742 (1958 ed.), provided the opportunity, upon application, for those, like petitioner, who had bought ships during the war years to obtain a downward adjustment in their sales price by treating the vessel as if it were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act [March 8, 1946], and not before that time.\" The details of a 9 adjustment are complex. They consist, however, essentially of two parts: (1) an adjustment in the purchase price down to the new statutory price ( 9 (b) (1)-(4)); and (2) an unwinding of the transactions, including tax payments, that occurred as a result of the sale prior to 1946 ( 9 (b) (5), (6), (c) (1)).\n3\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner applied for a downward adjustment of the sales price of its 18 ships purchased prior to the Act. The Maritime Commission granted such an adjustment, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n determining that under the statute the sales price of these vessels should be $17,685,424.\n4\n Petitioner therefore was credited with $29,287,743, the difference between the statutory sales price and the original price of $46,973,167.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe pre-Act transactions were then unwound, pursuant to the statute, as follows: (1) the Government was credited $13,430,431, representing the charter hire which had been paid by the Government to petitioner for use of the 18 vessels from 1942 to 1946;\n6\n (2) the Government was debited $1,495,125, representing charter hire which would have been paid by the Government to petitioner prior to 1946 for use of the four ships traded in by petitioner on the original purchase; (3) the Government was debited $2,686,262, representing a return of the interest petitioner paid on the mortgages and interest income which petitioner could have earned on the cash invested in the 18 vessels prior to the date of the Act had this cash not been so committed; and (4) the Government was debited $430,206, representing an overpayment by petitioner of federal income taxes, which, under the Act, were recalculated to give effect to the foregoing unwinding.\n7\n The sum of the unwinding credits and debits was a net credit in favor of the Government of $8,818,838. This \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n amount reduced petitioner's credit on the original sales price of $46,973,167 from $29,287,743 to $20,468,904.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn tabular form, the computations and credits made under the Act were as follows:\n\n  Statutory Adjustments.\n\n\n1. \nOriginal sales price............... $46,973,167\n\n2. \nStatutory sales price..............  17,685,424      ___________\n\n3. \nGross sales price adjustment ( 9 (b) (1)-(4) and (7)).....   $29,287,743\n\n4. \nCredit to Government:\n\n5. \nCharter hire on 18 vessels ( 9 (b) (6))..............  13,430,431\n\n6. \nDebits against Government:\n\n7. \nCharter hire on 4 ships traded in ( 9 (b) (6))..............

The issue between the parties is the effect of these determinations on the tax treatment of the ships for the years following this 1946 adjustment. In its federal income tax returns for the years 1947 through 1950 petitioner took depreciation on these vessels on the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n assumption that its cost was $17,685,424, the statutory sales price. In 1959, however, petitioner sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama for a tax refund, contending that its real cost and therefore its basis for depreciation was not the statutory sales price, $17,685,424, but rather $26,504,263, the difference between $46,973,167, the original sales price, and $20,468,904, the net 1946 sales price adjustment credited to petitioner. The District Court agreed with petitioner that its real cost was $26,504,263 and that this was its depreciation basis for tax purposes. 203 F. Supp. 915. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, however, holding that, under the statutory scheme, petitioner's real cost was $17,685,424, the statutory sales price, and that this therefore was its proper depreciation basis. 330 F.2d 128. The difference between the lower courts' determinations of the real cost to petitioner of these 18 ships is $8,818,838,\n10\n the net credit in favor of the Government in the preceding calculations of the 1946 sales price adjustment. We granted certiorari, \n379 \nU.S. 927\n, to resolve a conflict between Courts of Appeals and the Court of Claims on the issue here involved.\n11\n For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the Court of Appeals in this case and consequently affirm the judgment.\n\nPetitioner's argument, put quite simply, is that during the war it paid $46,973,167 for the ships. In 1946, petitioner asserts, it was paid back $20,468,904. Thus petitioner concludes that its cost and therefore its depreciation basis for tax purposes in these ships is the difference \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n between these two figures, or $26,504,263.\n12\n The Government agrees that petitioner paid $46,973,167 during the war and received back $20,468,904 in 1946. It points out, however, that from 1942 through 1946 petitioner also received from the Government in charter hire for the use of the ships, a net of $8,818,838 (the net credit to the Government under the unwinding provisions of the Act), which petitioner would not have received had it not bought these ships prior to the date of the Act. The Government contends that when this $8,818,838 paid to petitioner from 1942 to 1946 is added to the amount of $20,468,904 paid as a lump sum to petitioner in 1946, it is clear that petitioner has received a total of $29,287,743\n13\n from the Government. The Government concludes that petitioner's cost and therefore its basis for depreciation for tax purposes in these ships is the difference between the original sales price, $46,973,167, and this total refund, $29,287,743, or $17,685,424 - the statutory sales price. Petitioner cannot and does not dispute the fact that it received this $8,818,838 from the Government from 1942 through 1946. It argues, however, that this sum was received as income and thus cannot be taken to reduce petitioner's cost. The Government, on the other hand, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n contends that, although the $8,818,838 was undoubtedly originally received as income, under the statutory unwinding scheme this amount must be deemed a return of capital which has reduced petitioner's cost. The only issue dividing the parties, therefore, is the proper treatment of this $8,818,838, an issue which must be determined by reference to the 1946 Act.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nSection 9 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 expressly provides that, upon application, a statutory adjustment \"shall be made, as hereinafter provided, by treating the vessel as if it were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act [March 8, 1946], and not before that time.\" It is clear that if petitioner had bought the ships on the date of the Act its cost and depreciation basis would have been the statutory sales price of $17,685,424 and that petitioner would not have received net charter hire from the Government of $8,818,838 - a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 261]\n\u00a0\n payment attributable to the fact that the vessels involved were sold to it before the date of the 1946 Act.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to achieve the statutory purpose of putting petitioner and the Government in the positions they would have occupied had petitioner bought the ships on the 1946 statutory enactment date and not before that time, it was necessary that this $8,818,838 net charter hire be refunded to the Government. In effect this is just what 9 provides. As applied to this case, petitioner was first credited with $29,287,743, the difference between the original sales price, $46,973,167, and the lower statutory sales price, $17,685,424. The Government owed this amount of $29,287,743 to petitioner. Because of the unwinding of the pre-Act transactions pursuant to the statutory scheme, however, the Government was credited with $8,818,838, representing the net amount, after appropriate tax adjustments, which petitioner received from the United States Government from 1942 through 1946 over and above the amount which it would have earned had it not purchased the ships from the Government prior to the statutory adjustment date. Petitioner owed this amount of $8,818,838 to the Government.\n\nThe Government could have paid its obligation to petitioner by its check in the amount of $29,287,743. Petitioner, in turn, could have paid its obligation to the Government by its check in the amount of $8,818,838. Obviously, it makes no difference that this same result was reached through an offsetting of the mutual debts which \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 262]\n\u00a0\n resulted in a net credit to petitioner of their difference - $20,468,904.\n16\n Thus petitioner is correct in its assertion that it only received $20,468,904 as a lump sum payment in 1946. It is not correct, however, in its assertion that this was the total amount it received in repayment of the sales price. The total it received was $29,287,743; it received $20,468,904 of this amount in a lump sum in 1946 and $8,818,838\n17\n in the years 1942 through 1946 in government payments which it would not have received had it not owned the ships during those years - an ownership which the statute unwinds. This $29,287,743 total refund must be credited against petitioner's original cost of $46,973,167, producing a net cost to petitioner and thus a basis for depreciation of $17,685,424 - the statutory sales price.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to give effect to the statutory scheme, therefore, this $8,818,838 must be treated not as income but as a return of capital against the original $46,973,167 purchase price. That this is the proper way of treating this amount for tax purposes is made clear by the statutory language which directs recomputation of an applicant's federal income taxes based upon the unwinding of the pre-Act transactions. As a condition of receiving an adjustment under the Act, 9 (c) (1) requires the applicant to agree (1) that the charter hire actually received from \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 263]\n\u00a0\n the United States for the ships prior to the Act \"shall be treated for Federal tax purposes as not having been received or accrued as income\" (emphasis added); (2) that \"depreciation and amortization allowed or allowable with respect to the vessel up to the date of the enactment of this Act for Federal tax purposes shall be treated as not having been allowable\"; and (3) that the return of interest paid on the mortgages plus the income attributed to the applicant which it would have received as charter hire on the ships traded in and interest on the cash invested which it could have earned had it not bought the ships prior to the date of the Act \"shall be treated for Federal tax purposes as having been received and accrued as income . . . .\" The net sum derived from these tax computations is assigned as a credit to the party in whose favor they run, and payment of this credit is explicitly deemed to constitute payment of the tax overpayment or deficiency created by the recomputations. ( 9 (b) (8)).\n\nAll of these provisions, as we have already stated, were given effect in this case. Pursuant to agreement between petitioner and the Government, petitioner's federal income taxes were recomputed on the statutory assumptions that it did not receive the charter hire on the 18 vessels purchased from the Government from 1942 through 1946, but did receive charter hire on the four ships it traded in and interest on its investment in the 18 ships during this period. Based on this recalculation, petitioner was held entitled to a tax refund of $430,206, for which the Government was debited in the unwinding computations. See the table on p. 257, supra. The total impact of these tax provisions makes it quite clear that the net amount the Government paid to petitioner as a result of its owning the ships prior to 1946, $8,818,838, as the statute specifically states, \"shall be treated for Federal tax purposes as not having been received or accrued as income,\" but \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 264]\n\u00a0\n rather shall be treated as a repayment of the purchase price, or, in other words, a return of capital reducing basis. Moreover, the result contended for by petitioner would produce the anomaly that, due to the unwinding calculations, there is no income tax paid or to be paid on the $8,818,838 which petitioner claims is income earned during 1942 to 1946. This anomaly is only avoided if, as Congress obviously intended, this amount be treated not as income but rather as a return of capital.\n\nFurthermore, petitioner's argument is necessarily predicated on the theory that, although the original acquisition cost of the ships should, under the statutory scheme, be adjusted to the lower 1946 price, nevertheless, petitioner's cost as a basis for depreciation should remain the higher one determined on the assumption that the ships were purchased not in 1946 but at the time of their original acquisitions, dating back to 1942. It could only be under such a theory that the $8,818,838 net charter hire received by petitioner from the Government could be considered to be income and not a return of capital. But the Act vitiates any such theory in its express statement that the statute treats \"the vessel as if it were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act, and not before that time.\" Nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act supports petitioner's contention that this statutory treatment was to apply to give petitioner a lower actual cost of acquisition but that the contrary treatment sought by petitioner was to apply to give it, at the same time, a higher cost basis for depreciation purposes.\n\nIndeed, our conclusion derived from the plain words of the statute is confirmed fully by the legislative history of the Act. As originally reported out of the House Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries, see H. R. Rep. No. 831, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., and the Senate Committee on Commerce, see S. Rep. No. 807, 79th Cong., 1st \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 265]\n\u00a0\n Sess., the bill contained petitioner's assumption that the sale took place not on the date of the Act, but at its original date and at the lower statutory sales price. On the floor of the House, however, a committee amendment was proffered and accepted which rejected this assumption and premised the operation of 9 on the contrary assumption that the sale took place on the date of the enactment of the Act and not before. 91 Cong. Rec. 9281. This committee amendment is the version of the Act that was enacted into law. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1526, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 17.\n\nRepresentative (now Senator) Henry Jackson, the manager of the committee amendments on the House floor, explained it as follows:\n\n \"Section 9 of H. R. 3603 provides for a refund to operators who purchased vessels during the war, at war cost, back to the statutory sales price contained in section 3 of the bill. Such an adjustment is fair. We do not want to place the wartime purchaser at a disadvantage with his competitor who acquires a similar vessel under the provisions of this bill.\n\n\n \"However, section 9 contains many loopholes which in my opinion places the wartime purchaser in a far better position than future purchasers. For one thing, the wartime purchaser, under section 9, would be allowed trade-in allowances far in excess of those provided under the committee amendment to section 8.\n\n\n \"If there is to be equality between past and future purchases there must be comparable terms and nothing less. . . .\n\n\n  .  .  . . .\n\n\n \"I have proposed certain modifications to section 9 of H. R. 3603 which has been accepted as a committee amendment. The effect of this amendment \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 266]\n\u00a0\n is to treat prior sales as having taken place on the date of the enactment of this bill. The operator is compensated for all actual money investment to date by an allowance of 3 1\/2 percent interest thereon.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"The committee amendment treats all of these prior sales as being made on the date of the bill's enactment and not before that time, so that the previous purchaser and a future purchaser will be put on exactly the same basis. In order to accomplish this result it is necessary to `unwind' a previous transaction, and most of the provisions of the committee amendment which appear complicated are the provisions describing how this unwinding is to be done.\n\n\n  . .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"These are the provisions which the amendment includes for the purpose of unwinding the previous transaction. The basic principle of the amendment is very simple - the previous transaction is to be looked upon as having taken place not when it actually did but as taking place on the date of the bill's enactment and subject to all of the bill's provisions. . . .\" (Emphasis added.) 91 Cong. Rec. 9182, 9185, 9282.\n\n\n Treating pre-Act and post-Act purchasers as having the same tax basis in the vessels - the statutory sales price - serves the congressional purpose of putting the two groups \"on exactly the same basis.\" Otherwise, pre-Act purchasers, with a higher basis for federal income tax purposes, would have competitive advantages over post-Act purchasers in the ability of pre-Act purchasers to take higher depreciation deductions from income, thus paying lower taxes on the same income than their post-Act purchaser competitors. In fact, this advantage over \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 267]\n\u00a0\n post-Act purchasers is exactly what petitioner seeks in this case. Both petitioner and a post-Act purchaser of comparable ships would pay a statutory sales price of $17,685,424. Yet petitioner seeks a depreciation basis of $26,504,263 while the post-Act purchaser would only have a basis of $17,685,424. This varying result is prohibited by the statute.\n\nPetitioner argues, however, that the Senate predecessor to 9 of the 1946 Act contained an express provision that, if an adjustment in the purchase price is made for a pre-Act purchaser, for purposes of federal income taxes, \"the vessel shall be considered as having been acquired at the adjusted purchase price [the statutory sales price] . . . .\" See 9 (e) (1) of H. R. 3603, as amended by the Senate Committee on Commerce, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 91 Cong. Rec. 11535. Petitioner states that this provision, which would confirm the result here contended for by the Government, was eliminated from the version of the Act that was finally adopted. From these facts, petitioner would have us infer that Congress rejected the notion that the statutory sales price should be the cost basis of the ships for depreciation. This contention of petitioner, however, completely overlooks the fact that the provision upon which petitioner relies was in an early version of the bill which at that time was premised not on the assumption finally accepted that the sales took place on the 1946 statutory enactment date, but rather on the contrary theory that the sales took place at the statutory prices but on their original dates. On this latter assumption which the bill then contained, the express provision of the Senate bill was necessary to prevent the very result for which petitioner now contends. However, as we have already pointed out, in the legislative consideration of the bill as finally enacted, the early version of the bill premised on the assumption that the sales took place at their original dates was rejected and the bill revised to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 268]\n\u00a0\n embrace the contrary assumption that the sales took place at the date of the enactment of the Act and not before that time. See pp. 264-266, supra. Once this revision in the bill's basic approach was made there was no longer any necessity to provide, as the earlier Senate version had, that for tax or any other specific purpose \"the vessel shall be considered as having been acquired at the . . . [statutory sales] price . . . .\" For in the bill as finally enacted, it was expressly provided that the vessel is to be treated \"as if it were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act, and not before that time,\" and explicit provision was made for unwinding all pre-Act transactions, including taxes. We therefore reject this argument of petitioner.\n\nFinally, petitioner argues that the congressional history subsequent to the enactment of the 1946 statute supports its interpretation of the Act. In 1950, Congress passed an amendment to the 1946 Act, designed to provide precisely the tax result here contended for by petitioner.\n19\n This amendment, however, was vetoed by President Truman. While both House and Senate Committee Reports contain statements that this amendment was deemed simply a clarifying one which expressed the intent of the original Act, see H. R. Rep. No. 1342, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 1; S. Rep. No. 1915, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 1, it was vetoed by President Truman on the ground that, on the contrary, he considered it to vitiate the intent of Congress \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 269]\n\u00a0\n in enacting the 1946 Act. The President's veto message stated:\n\n\"[O]ther provisions of the Merchant Ship Sales Act already provide that for certain purposes the cost basis of the vessels owned by prior purchasers shall be the statutory sales price. The consistent pattern of treatment provided in the act would be destroyed by granting in this one subsection the concession on cost basis entailed in this measure. Finally, the benefits accruing to prior purchasers, if they are allowed to capitalize these amounts above the statutory sales price, would afford them the special operating advantages which arise from the higher depreciation allowances possible under this measure.\" 96 Cong. Rec. 15792.\n\n\n Thus, it is apparent that the President and Congress disagreed over the meaning of a law passed by a prior Congress, and that the President, deeming the amendment to depart from the purpose of the original statute, refused to approve it so that the amendment was not enacted into law. This Court has pointed out on previous occasions that \"the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\" United States v. Price, \n361 \nU.S. 304, 313\n; United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, \n374 \nU.S. 321, 348\n-349. This is particularly true where a President (the same President who signed the original Act) vetoes a \"clarifying\" amendment on the grounds that, in his view, it does not clarify but rather vitiates the intent of the Congress that passed the original Act. As this Court held in Fogarty v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 8\n, in considering a similar situation, the abortive action of the subsequent Congress \"would not supplant the contemporaneous intent of the Congress which enacted the . . . Act.\" Id., at 14. See also United States v. Wise, \n370 \nU.S. 405, 411\n. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor all the reasons set forth above, we conclude that, under the statutory scheme which unwinds the pre-Act transactions, petitioner's real cost and thus its basis for depreciation was the statutory sales price of $17,685,424.\n20\n Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n Section 9 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 46, 50 U.S.C. App. 1742 (1958 ed.), provides in relevant part:\n\n\"SEC. 9. (a) A citizen of the United States who on the date of the enactment of this Act -\n\n\n\"(1) owns a vessel which he purchased from the Commission prior to such date, and which was delivered by its builder after December 31, 1940; . . .\n\n.   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"shall, except as hereinafter provided, be entitled to an adjustment in the price of such vessel under this section if he makes application therefor, in such form and manner as the Commission may prescribe, within sixty days after the date of publication of the applicable prewar domestic costs in the Federal Register under section 3 (c) of this Act. . . .\n\n\n\"(b) Such adjustment shall be made, as hereinafter provided, by treating the vessel as if it were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act, and not before that time. The amount of such adjustment shall be determined as follows:\n\n\n\"(1) The Commission shall credit the applicant with the excess of the cash payments made upon the original purchase price of the vessel over 25 per centum of the statutory sales price of the vessel as of such date of enactment. If such payment was less than 25 per centum of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 271]\n\u00a0\n the statutory sales price of the vessel, the applicant shall pay the difference to the Commission.\n\n\n\"(2) The applicant's indebtedness under any mortgage to the United States with respect to the vessel shall be adjusted.\n\n\n\"(3) The adjusted mortgage indebtedness shall be in an amount equal to the excess of the statutory sales price of the vessel as of the date of the enactment of this Act over the sum of the cash payment retained by the United States under paragraph (1) plus the readjusted trade-in allowance (determined under paragraph (7)) with respect to any vessel exchanged by the applicant on the original purchase. The adjusted mortgage indebtedness shall be payable in equal annual installments thereafter during the remaining life of such mortgage with interest on the portion of the statutory sales price remaining unpaid at the rate of 3 1\/2 per centum per annum.\n\n\n\"(4) The Commission shall credit the applicant with the excess, if any, of the sum of the cash payments made by the applicant upon the original purchase price of the vessel plus the readjusted trade-in allowance (determined under paragraph (7)) over the statutory sales price of the vessel as of the date of the enactment of this Act to the extent not credited under paragraph (1).\n\n\n\"(5) The Commission shall also credit the applicant with an amount equal to interest at the rate of 3 1\/2 per centum per annum (for the period beginning with the date of the original delivery of the vessel to the applicant and ending with the date of the enactment of this Act) on the excess of the original purchase price of the vessel over the amount of any allowance allowed by the Commission on the exchange of any vessel on such purchase; the amount of such credit first being reduced by any interest on the original mortgage indebtedness accrued up to such date of enactment and unpaid. Interest so accrued and unpaid shall be canceled. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 272]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"(6) The applicant shall credit the Commission with all amounts paid by the United States to him as charter hire for use of the vessel (exclusive of service, if any, required under the terms of the charter) under any charter party made prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, and any charter hire for such use accrued up to such date of enactment and unpaid shall be canceled; and the Commission shall credit the applicant with the amount that would have been paid by the United States to the applicant as charter hire for bare-boat use of vessels exchanged by the applicant on the original purchase (for the period beginning with date on which the vessels so exchanged were delivered to the Commission and ending with the date of the enactment of this Act).\n\n\n\"(7) The allowance made to the applicant on any vessel exchanged by him on the original purchase shall be readjusted so as to limit such allowance to the amount provided for under section 8.\n\n\n\"(8) There shall be subtracted from the sum of the credits in favor of the Commission under the foregoing provisions of this subsection the amount of any overpayments of Federal taxes by the applicant resulting from the application of subsection (c) (1), and there shall be subtracted from the sum of the credits in favor of the applicant under the foregoing provisions of this subsection the amount of any deficiencies in Federal taxes of the applicant resulting from the application of subsection (c) (1). If, after making such subtractions, the sum of the credits in favor of the applicant exceeds the sum of the credits in favor of the Commission, such excess shall be paid by the Commission to the applicant. If, after making such subtractions, the sum of the credits in favor of the Commission exceeds the sum of the credits in favor of the applicant, such excess shall be paid by the applicant to the Commission. Upon such payment by the Commission or the applicant, such overpayments \n\n[381 \nU.S. 252, 273]\n\u00a0\n shall be treated as having been refunded and such deficiencies as having been paid.\n\n\n\"For the purposes of this subsection, the purchase price of a vessel on account of which a construction-differential subsidy was paid or agreed to be paid under section 504 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, shall be the net cost of the vessel to the owner.\n\n\n\"(c) An adjustment shall be made under this section only if the applicant enters into an agreement with the Commission binding upon the citizen applicant and any affiliated interest to the effect that -\n\n\n\"(1) depreciation and amortization allowed or allowable with respect to the vessel up to the date of the enactment of this Act for Federal tax purposes shall be treated as not having been allowable; amounts credited to the Commission under subsection (b) (6) shall be treated for Federal tax purposes as not having been received or accrued as income; amounts credited to the applicant under subsection (b) (5) and (6) shall be treated for Federal tax purposes as having been received and accrued as income in the taxable year in which falls the date of the enactment of this Act . . . .\"\n\n\n (\"Secretary,\" meaning Secretary of Commerce, was substituted for \"Commission\" in the above statute, except where otherwise indicated by the context, on authority of 1950 Reorg. Plan No. 21, effective May 24, 1950, 15 Fed. Reg. 3178, 64 Stat. 1273.)\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The total purchase price (without trade-in allowance) was $49,582,767. The trade-in allowance was $2,609,600. The net purchase price of $46,973,167 consisted of a cash payment of $6,449,107 and mortgage indebtedness of $40,524,060. For simplicity in this opinion, the $46,973,167 purchase price will be considered as if it had all been paid in cash.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The last two vessels purchased by petitioner were delivered on February 27, 1946, and March 11, 1946, respectively, one just before and the other just after the date (March 8, 1946) of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 41, as amended, 50 U.S.C. App. 1735 et seq. (1958 ed.), and thus were not chartered to the Government before the Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 9, in relevant part, is set out in the Appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] As with the original purchase price, this figure is after an allowance for the four vessels traded in. The statutory price (without trade-in allowance) was $17,997,981. The trade-in allowance (determined under 9 (b) (7) was $312,557. For simplicity, in the remainder of this opinion, the figures used for both the original sales price and the statutory sales price will be those of the price after these respective trade-in allowances.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The total $29,287,743 purchase price credit was comprised of a cash credit of $11,735,951 and a reduction of mortgage indebtedness of $17,551,792. As with the original purchase price, see note 1, supra, for simplicity this total credit will be considered as if it were all a cash credit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This recalculation included a readjustment of previous depreciation allowed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The figure $20,468,904 is one dollar smaller than the difference between $29,287,743 and $8,818,838. This discrepancy is caused by the omission from the calculation of figures of amounts less than one dollar. This net credit of $20,468,904 was divided into a cash credit to petitioner of $2,917,112 and a reduction of the mortgage indebtedness by $17,551,792. Again, for simplicity, this 1946 net credit will be considered as if it were all a cash credit. See notes 1 and 5, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See note 8, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See note 14, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agrees with the result of the Court of Appeals in this case. See National Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. United States, 331 F.2d 407. However, these decisions conflict with that of the Court of Claims in Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. United States, 153 Ct. Cl. 638, 287 F.2d 910, upon which the District Court in the instant case relied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] As stated in note 1, supra, the original purchase price of $46,973,167 consisted of a $6,449,107 cash payment and $40,524,060 in mortgage indebtedness. By the statutory enactment date of March 8, 1946, petitioner had paid an additional $9,786,339 on the mortgage. At that date therefore the original $46,973,167 purchase price consisted of a cash payment of $16,235,446 and a now reduced mortgage indebtedness of $30,737,721. As stated in note 8, supra, the 1946 payment to petitioner was comprised of a cash credit of $2,917,112 and a reduction of the mortgage indebtedness by $17,551,792. Thus under petitioner's calculations, after the 1946 adjustment its cost of the vessels was the sum of its cash investment of $13,318,334 ($16,235,446 minus $2,917,112) and its mortgage indebtedness of $13,185,929 ($30,737,721 minus $17,551,792), or $26,504,263.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See note 8, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The figure of $8,818,838 is one dollar lower than the difference between the basis figures as asserted by the two parties. This discrepancy is brought about by the fact that all figures have been rounded off to dollar amounts. Also, the asserted basis figures given in the text are based upon the parties' contentions as to the correct cost figure for the 18 ships. They do not take into account the undisputed figure of $175,876 which represents the basis of the four ships traded in and which both parties agree should be added to their respective cost bases as given in text. In tabular form, the tax contentions are as follows:\n\n     Government Petitioner\n\n\n1. \nOriginal sales price .................... $46,973,167  $46,973,167\n\n2. \nNet charter payments by the Government to petitioner from 1942-1946 ........... (8,818,838)  (..........)\n\n3. \nLump sum payment by Government to petitioner in 1946 .................. (20,468,904)  (20,468,904)       ____________  ____________\n\n4. \nAdjusted sales price .................... 17,685,424  26,504,263\n\n5. \nBasis of ships traded in ................ 175,876  175,876       ___________ ___________\n\n6. \nBasis as of March 8, 1946 ............... $17,861,300 $26,680,139\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] As we have already discussed, this $8,818,838 represents the $13,430,431 charter hire which petitioner received from the Government because it owned these ships during the war, as offset by debits to the Government and credits to petitioner representing the charter hire which petitioner would have received on its four ships which it traded in, interest on petitioner's investment in the ships during this period, and a refund of income taxes paid on this unwound charter hire.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See note 8, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See note 8, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] As noted above, notes 1, 5, 8, 12, supra, these figures are stated on the basis that the whole transaction was for cash. The same result is achieved, however, when the transaction is viewed on the mortgage basis as set forth in note 12, supra. When this is done the $8,818,838 is seen as a cash payment by the Government to petitioner which must be credited against its asserted net cash investment of $13,318,334, reducing it to $4,499,496. On this basis, petitioner's cost therefore is its net cash investment of $4,499,496 plus its mortgage indebtedness of $13,185,929, or $17,685,424 - the statutory sales price. (Again there is a one-dollar discrepancy because of the rounding off of all figures to dollar amounts.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The amendment provided, as an addition to subsection 9 (b) of the Act:\n\n\"From and after March 8, 1946, the cost basis of a vessel in respect of which the price adjustment is made shall be the undepreciated original purchase price reduced by the net amount of such adjustment in favor of the applicant resulting from the application of all of the foregoing provisions of this subsection.\"\n\n\n See H.

Hayes for respondent Seward School Board.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nPetitioners Watts and Blue were dismissed from their positions as schoolteachers in Seward, Alaska, on grounds of \"immorality,\" which under Alaska Statutes 1962, 14.20.170 was defined as \"conduct of the person tending to bring the individual concerned or the teaching profession into public disgrace or disrespect.\" Petitioners' dismissals were upheld by the Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District), and on appeal the Alaska Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's decision. 395 P.2d 372. The Alaska Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he immoral conduct complained of as to the appellant Watts was his holding of private conversations with various teachers in which he solicited their support in an attempt to oust the school superintendent from his job. The allegedly immoral conduct of the appellant Blue was his making of a speech to a labor union at Seward in which he stated. `We have been unable to get rid of the [school] \n\n[381 \nU.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n Superintendent, so we are going to get rid of the Board,' or words to that effect.\" 395 P.2d, at 374. The Alaska Supreme Court held that this conduct \"had a tendency to bring the [petitioners] . . . and the teaching profession into public disgrace or disrespect,\" within the terms of the statute, 395 P.2d, at 375, and it therefore sustained their dismissals. Petitioners contend that their dismissals for engaging in the conduct here described unconstitutionally infringe their rights to political expression guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nWe need not consider petitioners' contentions at this time, for since their petition for certiorari was filed Alaska has amended its statutes in this area. House Bill 27, adopted by the Alaska Legislature and signed by the Governor on March 31, 1965, now defines \"immorality\" as grounds for revocation of a teaching certificate, as \"the commission of an act which, under the laws of the state, constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude.\" Moreover, Alaska Statutes, Tit. 14. c. 20, have been amended by the addition of a new section which reads:\n\n \"Sec. 14.20.095. Right to Comment and Criticize Not to be Restricted. No rule or regulation of the commissioner of education, a local school board, or local school administrator may restrict or modify the right of a teacher to engage in comment and criticism outside school hours, relative to school administrators, members of the governing body of any school or school district, any other public official, or any school employee, to the same extent that any private individual may exercise the right.\"\n\n\n This Court has held that supervening changes in state law that may be relevant to the disposition of a case may require that the cause be remanded for appropriate action by the state court.

Accordingly, it is appropriate to allow the Alaska court to consider the effect of the new Alaska statutes upon this case. To that end, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alaska is vacated, and this case is remanded to that court for such further consideration as may be deemed appropriate by that court under Alaska law.\n\n   Vacated and remanded. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","229":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELLS v.

R. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1965)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 19, 1965Decided: December 7, 1965\n\n\n\n\n Section 3 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act prohibits carriers from discriminating in their rates between \"connecting lines.\" Appellant Western Pacific Railroad filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission alleging that certain carriers discriminated against it by refusing to enter into joint through rates via Portland, Oregon, with a multi-railroad route of which Western Pacific is the central portion, although they maintain such joint through rates with a competitor. Division 2 of the Commission refused to accord Western Pacific \"connecting line\" status on the ground that it did not connect physically with the allegedly discriminating carriers and did not participate in existing through routes with them through the point of discrimination. The Commission denied further hearing and a three-judge federal court dismissed the complaint on the basis that Western Pacific was not a \"connecting line.\" Held:\n\n 1. The term \"connecting lines\" does not require a direct physical connection, but refers to all lines making up a through route. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 288\n, followed. Pp. 242-243.\n\n\n 2. To qualify as a \"connecting line\" in the absence of physical connection, a carrier need only show that it participates in an established through route, making connection at the point of common interchange, all of whose participants stand ready to cooperate in the arrangements needed to remove the alleged discrimination.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 3 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 54 Stat. 902, 49 U.S.C. 3 (4) (1964 ed.), commands that \"All carriers subject to the provisions of this chapter . . . shall not discriminate in their rates, fares, and charges between connecting lines . . . .\"\n1\n The meaning of the term \"connecting lines\" is the crucial question in this controversy between the Western Pacific Railroad Company, on the one hand, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, on the other. Western Pacific contends that it is a \"connecting line\" in relation to these carriers and that, therefore, it is entitled to invoke against them the provisions of 3 (4) prohibiting discriminatory \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n rates. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the District Court held otherwise.\n\nWestern Pacific filed a complaint with the Commission, alleging, in part, that Union Pacific and Northern Pacific practice rate discrimination against it.\n2\n The alleged discrimination consists in the refusal of these carriers, except with respect to a few commodities, to enter into joint through rates via Portland, Oregon, with the route of which Western Pacific is part, although they maintain a full line of such rates with a competitor, the Southern Pacific Company. The hearing examiner found in favor of Western Pacific, but Division 2 of the Commission reversed. The Division found both that Western Pacific could not invoke the provisions of 3 (4) because it was not a \"connecting line,\" and that, even if it were, the evidence did not establish the \"similarity of circumstances and conditions\" that would compel rate treatment equal to that accorded to Southern Pacific. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 240]\n\u00a0\n The Division refused to accord Western Pacific \"connecting line\" status on the ground that it neither physically connects with the allegedly discriminating carriers at the point of discrimination, nor participates in existing through routes with them through that point. Western Pacific R. Co. v. Camas Prairie R. Co., 316 I. C. C. 795. When the full Commission denied further hearing, Western Pacific brought this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to set aside the Commission's order. The three-judge court dismissed the complaint solely on the ground that Western Pacific was not a \"connecting line.\" Western Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 230 F. Supp. 852. It agreed with the Commission's limited definition of the term and said, \"Any further liberalization of the present definition will have to come from the Supreme Court.\" Id., at 855. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n379 \nU.S. 956\n.\n\nAnalysis of \"connecting line\" status in this case is closely tied to the geographical, structural, and economic relationships among the railroads involved. Union Pacific, Northern Pacific and their short-line connections provide exclusive rail service between many points in the Pacific Northwest and Portland, Oregon. From Portland, the two competitive routes in question descend, at times parallel, at times intertwined, to Southern California. The route closest to the seacoast consists largely of Southern Pacific. To the east of this route lies the so-called Bieber route whose completion in 1931 was authorized by the Commission to provide competition with Southern Pacific.\n3\n The Bieber route is composed of the end-to-end connections of three different companies: the Great Northern Railway from Portland to \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 241]\n\u00a0\n Bieber, California; the Western Pacific from Bieber to Stockton; and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe from Stockton to Southern California. Thus the Bieber route and Southern Pacific both connect with the allegedly discriminating carriers at Portland where facilities for the interchange of traffic exist.\n\nThe Bieber route carriers presently enjoy joint through rates among themselves. Moreover, the other two participants in that route have expressed willingness to join with Western Pacific in the joint rates it seeks with Union Pacific and Northern Pacific. Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, for over 50 years, have maintained through routes and a full line of joint rates with Southern Pacific via Portland. They have refused, however, except for a few commodities, to offer through routes and joint rates on traffic moving on the Bieber route through Portland. The joint rates established with Southern Pacific are lower than the combination of local rates that would otherwise apply. Since the Bieber route carriers can offer joint rates only with respect to a few commodities, they cannot match the lower rates offered by Southern Pacific to shippers of most commodities between points in California and points in the Pacific Northwest exclusively served by Union Pacific and Northern Pacific via Portland.\n\nThe Commission and the District Court held, however, that even under these circumstances, Western Pacific is not a \"connecting line\" eligible to complain of the alleged discrimination. In argument here the Commission and the appellee railroads contend that to qualify for that status Western Pacific must show more than that it participates in an established through route that connects with Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, and that all the participants in the route stand willing to cooperate with these carriers in establishing joint through \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 242]\n\u00a0\n rates.\n4\n We are urged to hold that to qualify under 3 (4) as a complainant \"connecting line\" a railroad must either itself make a direct connection with the discriminating carrier, or be part of a through route that already includes the carrier. We cannot accept such a construction of the statute.\n\nThe literal meaning of the statute does not require that construction. To be sure, the term, \"connecting lines\" suggests the requirement of an actual physical connection between the complainant and the discriminating carrier. The term \"line,\" however, admits of more than a single meaning limited to the track owned exclusively by one railroad company. It may also be interpreted reasonably to include a functional railroad unit such as the Bieber through route involved here. Moreover, all parties in this litigation recognize that in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 288\n, this Court rejected the contention that \"connecting line\" is a term limited to the meaning that the statutory language might initially suggest. Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for a unanimous Court, wrote, \"There is no warrant for limiting the meaning of `connecting lines' to those having a direct physical connection . . . . The term is commonly used as referring to all the lines making up a through route.\" Id., at 293.\n\nThere also is no warrant for limiting the meaning of \"connecting lines\" to the lines making up a through route that already includes the discriminating carrier. We have been referred to no previous judicial or administrative decisions compelling that conclusion. The Atlantic Coast Line case, supra, imposes no such limitation. It established that the term \"connecting lines\" \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 243]\n\u00a0\n extends beyond physical connection to encompass lines participating in a through route, but it does not even hint of any limitation on the nature of the through route, much less hold that the through route must already include the discriminating carrier.\n5\n Our subsequent definition of \"through route\" in Thompson v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 549\n, adds no more to an analysis of \"connecting line\" under 3 (4). In that case, which arose under 15 (3) and 15 (4) of the Act, we held that the Commission had improperly applied the test of the existence of a through route: \". . . whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service.\" \n343 \nU.S., at 557\n. Section 3 (4) does not use the term \"through route.\" But even if, after Atlantic Coast Line, a carrier may qualify as a \"connecting line\" if it is one of the \"lines making up a through route,\" \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 244]\n\u00a0\n \n284 \nU.S., at 293\n, the Thompson test offers no solution to the problem presented here. It simply does not speak to the question whether the discriminating carrier must be one of the participating carriers offering through service in conjunction with the carrier seeking \"connecting line\" status.\n\nThe reason the issue presented in this case has not been decided before now\n6\n may be that discrimination of the sort complained of here is uncommon. In most instances it is to the advantage of railroads such as Union Pacific and Northern Pacific to encourage the movement of traffic over their lines from as many sources as possible.\n7\n Moreover, when such discrimination does occur the railroad connecting directly with the discriminating carrier is likely to take the lead as complainant.\n\nIn the absence of any settled construction of 3 (4), then, its manifest purpose to deprive railroads of discretion to apportion economic advantage among competitors at a common interchange must be the basic guide to decision. Just such discretion would be conferred upon railroads in a position to discriminate if we were to hold that their decisions not to enter through route relationships with connecting through routes could bar nonadjacent participants in such through routes from eligibility to complain. Indeed such a holding would result in an anomalous set of circumstances clearly illustrated in the present context. No one doubts that Southern Pacific, by virtue of its direct physical connection, \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 245]\n\u00a0\n would be eligible to complain of rate discrimination if it were practiced in favor of the Bieber route. It is also undisputed that Great Northern would be eligible to complain of the present discrimination, not merely as it affects its segment of the Bieber route, but on behalf of the route as a whole. Moreover, it is clear that if Union Pacific and Northern Pacific had entered a through route relationship with the Bieber route and then had decided to abandon it, or to set rates somewhat higher than those set for Southern Pacific, any participant in the Bieber route could complain of that discrimination. We cannot therefore construe 3 (4) to bar these participants from eligibility to complain solely because they have been put to an even greater competitive disadvantage by the refusal of the allegedly discriminating carriers to enter a through route relationship with them comparable to the one established with Southern Pacific. Hence, we hold that to qualify as a \"connecting line,\" in the absence of physical connection, a carrier need only show that it participates in an established through route, making connection at the point of common interchange, all of whose participants stand willing to cooperate in the arrangements necessary to eliminate the alleged discrimination.\n\nSuch a construction of \"connecting line\" does not interfere with the function of the Commission under 15 (3) of the Act, 54 Stat. 911, 49 U.S.C. 15 (3) (1964 ed.), to require the establishment of through routes and joint rates \"in the public interest.\"\n8\n Section \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 246]\n\u00a0\n 3 (4) is applicable only to a narrower range of situations involving discrimination at a common interchange. Moreover, the remedy in 3 (4) situations need not entail the establishment of through routes, joint rates, or indeed any particular form of relief. All that is required is the elimination of discriminatory treatment. See Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville R. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287, 292\n-293; United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 520\n-521. Finally, our holding does no more than to define the characteristics of a carrier eligible to complain. Relief is warranted only if it also appears that differential treatment is not justified by differences in operating conditions that substantially affect the allegedly discriminating carrier. See United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra, at p. 521; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, 218 F. Supp. 359, 369.\n\nIn the present case, having found that Western Pacific was not eligible to complain, the District Court did not reach the question whether it was entitled to relief. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3 (4) provides in full:\n\n\"All carriers subject to the provisions of this chapter shall, according to their respective powers, afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines and connecting lines, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of passengers or property to and from connecting lines; and shall not discriminate in their rates, fares, and charges between connecting lines, or unduly prejudice any connecting line in the distribution of traffic that is not specifically routed by the shipper. As used in this paragraph the term `connecting line' means the connecting line of any carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter or any common carrier by water subject to chapter 12 of this title.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Western Pacific and its subsidiaries named as defendants: The Northern Pacific Railway Company, The Union Pacific Railroad Company, and certain of their short-line connections. These railroads denied the allegations of the complaint. The Southern Pacific Company intervened in opposition to the complaint. The complaint also named as defendants: The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, The Great Northern Railway Company, and certain short-line connections. These railroads answered expressing willingness to join in the relief sought by Western Pacific.\n\nThe complaint also alleged violation of 1 (4) of the Act which requires, in part, that railroads establish \"reasonable through routes\" with other carriers and \"just and reasonable rates, fares, charges, and classifications applicable thereto . . . .\" When such routes are not established voluntarily, the Commission has authority under 15 (3), to prescribe them \"in the public interest.\" This authority is subject to the short-haul limitation embodied in 15 (4). Although the complaints indicated a willingness to rely solely on the alleged violation of 3 (4), the Commission found against them on the 1 (4) allegation as well. No question under 1 (4) is presented here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Great Northern R. Co. Construction, 166 I. C. C. 3, 39; 170 I. C. C. 399.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2322 (1964 ed.), the United States was named as defendant in the District Court. It did not, however, join with the Commission in defense of the Commission's order, and it supports Western Pacific in this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In the Atlantic Coast Line case, certain railroads leasing the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railway with the approval of the Commission filed restrictive schedules designed ultimately to exclude an as yet incomplete extension of the Georgia & Florida Railroad from participating, when completed, in joint rates over the Clinchfield. The Commission ordered the schedules canceled on the ground that they violated terms in the lease, accepted by the lessees, on which the Commission had conditioned its approval. One condition required the lessees to permit the Clinchfield to be used as a link for through traffic with \"such other carriers, now connecting, or which may hereafter connect, with [it] . . . .\" \n284 \nU.S., at 292\n, note 3. The extension of the Georgia & Florida made connection with the Clinchfield only via the rails of an intermediate carrier. This Court sustained the Commission's order, however, and held that the Georgia & Florida was a carrier connecting with the Clinchfield because it was one of the \"lines making up a through route.\" \n284 \nU.S., at 293\n. Even assuming that the through route referred to was not one limited to the complaining carrier and the intermediate carrier, it is clear that this Court was not faced with the question whether the complaining railroad would be regarded as a \"connecting line\" if the through route establishing the connection did not also encompass the Clinchfield. In short, Atlantic Coast Line did not present the issue squarely before us now.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Although we do not regard Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville R. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287\n, as dispositive of the question presented, that case, on its facts, supports the conclusion we reach.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In response to an inquiry at oral argument, the parties have submitted memoranda agreeing that through routes and joint rates are ordinarily established by voluntary agreement, and that a railroad usually interchanges traffic on a comparable basis with competing railroads at a common interchange. See also Thompson v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 549, 554\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 15 (3) provides in relevant part:\n\n\"The Commission may, and it shall whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after full hearing upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, establish through routes, joint classifications, and joint rates, fares, or charges, applicable to the transportation of passengers or property by carriers subject to this chapter . . . or the maxima or minima, or maxima and minima, to be charged, and the divisions of such rates, fares, or charges as hereinafter provided, and the terms and conditions under which such through routes shall be operated.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nUnder the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 1 et seq., as I read it, there are two ways of obtaining \"through routes.\" One is to qualify as a \"connecting line\" within the meaning of 3 (4) where a similarly situated competing carrier has been given a through route.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 247]\n\u00a0\n The other is to apply for a rate for a \"through route\" under 1 (4).\n2\n In the event that a carrier refuses to establish a \"through route,\" the Commission may \"upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint,\" establish a \"through route\" when \"deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.\" 15 (3).\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn this case appellants sought a \"through route\" with certain appellee railroads on the same basis as the joint rates those railroads had established with the Southern \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 248]\n\u00a0\n Pacific. In an adversary proceeding the Commission denied the establishment of a \"through route\" under 1 (4) saying:\n\n \". . . The shippers urge that the rates and routes sought would give them more freedom of choice in the movement of their goods, would improve transportation service, time in transit, and car supply, and make available additional transit privileges. Nothing of record, however, indicates that the existing through routes and joint rates are inadequate to meet the needs of the shipping public. In fact the failure of the shipper witnesses to initiate in the last 31 years a determined campaign to persuade the defendants of the necessity of establishing through routes between points on the complainants' lines in California and points on the defendants' lines in the Northwest, is at least some indication of the adequacy of the existing routes. The expression `in the public interest' means more than a mere desire on the part of shippers for something that would merely be convenient or desirable for them. This desire must be weighed against the effect on other carriers and the general public. On the basis of this record, we cannot find that the public interest would be served by requiring the establishment of joint rates and through routes which are substantially slower and costlier than the present routes.\" 316 I. C. C. 795, 810-811.\n\n\n What the Court does today is to let 3 (4) swallow 1 (4) by letting any segment of a multi-carrier through route become a \"connecting line.\"\n4\n For then the ban \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 249]\n\u00a0\n in 3 (4) on discriminatory rates in effect forces the establishment of \"through routes\" with \"just and reasonable rates\" as required by 1 (4), without satisfying any of the conditions of 1 (4) and of 15 (3). Indeed after today, the whole protective scheme of 15 (3) which makes the Commission the guardian of \"through routes\" (see St. Louis R. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 142\n-143) breaks down.\n\nIn addition to the conditions set forth in 15 (3) the Commission's power to compel the establishment of through routes is limited by 15 (4), which prevents the Commission from establishing any through route requiring a carrier to \"short haul\" itself except where particular circumstances (enumerated in 15 (4)) are found to exist. See Thompson v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 549, 552\n-556; Denver & R. G. W. R. Co. v. Union P. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 321, 325\n et seq.; Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 745\n. Can a carrier after today's decision be compelled to \"short haul\" itself where an internal segment of a multi-carrier through route invokes 3 (4) ?\n5\n\u00a0\n\nSection 3 (4) narrowly construed to include only lines that physically abut, would, of course, lift some cases from 1 (4) and from 15. But those are the exceptions, relatively few in number. The Court multiplies those almost without end when it holds that any interior segment of an established multi-carrier through route is a \"connecting line\" within the meaning of 3 (4).\n\nToday's decision uproots the established concept of \"through routes.\" As we stated in Thompson v. United \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 250]\n\u00a0\n States, \n343 \nU.S. 549, 557\n (quoting from the Commission's 21st Annual Report to Congress):\n\n\"A through route is a continuous line of railway formed by an arrangement, express or implied, between connecting carriers. . . . Existence of a through route is to be determined by the incidents and circumstances of the shipment, such as the billing, the transfer from one carrier to another, the collection and division of transportation charges, or the use of a proportional rate to or from junction points or basing points. These incidents named are not to be regarded as exclusive of others which may tend to establish a carrier's course of business with respect to through shipments.\"\n\n\n Then we added:\n\n\"In short, the test of the existence of a `through route' is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service. Through carriage implies the existence of a through route whatever the form of the rates charged for the through service.\" Ibid. (Italics added.)\n\n\n And see Denver & R. G. W. R. Co. v. Union P. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 330.\n\nHere there has been no \"holding out\" by the participating carriers (either consensually or as a result of any Commission action) that offers this interior segment of this multi-carrier route to become a part of any \"through route.\" If we are to allow 1 (4) and 3 (4) and 15 (3) to exist in harmony, we must adhere to that requirement, restricting \"connecting line\" to those lines that have a direct physical connection with the allegedly discriminating carrier.\n\nAtlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 288\n, is not opposed. While the line in question was only a segment in a multi-carrier system, it had \"through \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 251]\n\u00a0\n routes\" with the other carriers in controversy. Id., at 292. The words \"connecting lines\"\n6\n were therefore used to include \"all the lines making up a through route.\" Id., at 293. But there is no \"through route\" here, the defendants not having agreed to one and the Commission having expressly disallowed one pursuant to its power under 15 (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3 (4) provides:\n\n\"All carriers subject to the provisions of this chapter shall, according to their respective powers, afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines and connecting lines, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 247]\n\u00a0\n of passengers or property to and from connecting lines; and shall not discriminate in their rates, fares, and charges between connecting lines, or unduly prejudice any connecting line in the distribution of traffic that is not specifically routed by the shipper. As used in this paragraph the term `connecting line' means the connecting line of any carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter or any common carrier by water subject to chapter 12 of this title.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n The discriminatory refusal to enter into through routes has been held to constitute a violation of 3 (4). See Dixie Carriers, Inc. v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 56\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 1 (4) provides in part:\n\n\"It shall be the duty of every common carrier subject to this chapter to provide and furnish transportation upon reasonable request therefor, and to establish reasonable through routes with other such carriers, and just and reasonable rates, fares, charges, and classifications applicable thereto; . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 15 (3) provides in part:\n\n\"The Commission may, and it shall whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after full hearing upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, establish through routes, joint classifications, and joint rates, fares, or charges, applicable to the transportation of passengers or property by carriers subject to this chapter, or by carriers by railroad subject to this chapter and common carriers by water subject to chapter 12 of this title, or the maxima, or minima, or maxima and minima, to be charged, and the divisions of such rates, fares, or charges as hereinafter provided, and the terms and conditions under which such through routes shall be operated.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The term \"multi-carrier through route\" is used here to indicate a route composed of two or more carriers which have established among themselves a through route with joint rates. This, of \n\n[382 \nU.S. 237, 249]\n\u00a0\n course, describes the Bieber route from southern California to Portland.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Congress has refused, although requested to do so by the Commission, to repeal 15 (4). See Thompson v. United States, supra, at 555.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 3 (4) was not involved. What was in litigation was the construction of one of its earlier orders allowing one carrier to lease another.

Bank of New Orleans & Trust Co. et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\n A New Orleans-based national bank, desiring to expand but prohibited from operating branches beyond its home parish, formed a holding company which in turn organized a new national bank to operate in an adjoining parish. Pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), after receiving favorable advice from the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller), held hearings on the application by the holding company. The FRB approved the plan on May 3, 1962. The sole remaining action needed to enable the new bank to operate was a certificate of authority from the Comptroller acting under the National Bank Act. On June 9, 1962, three state banks brought this action in federal district court to restrain the Comptroller from issuing the certificate. On June 13, 1962, two respondent banks filed a petition with the FRB for reconsideration, which was denied as untimely and without substantial merit. Thereafter, on June 30, 1962, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was asked to review the FRB action under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which suit is still pending. On July 10, 1962, a Louisiana law was passed making it unlawful for any bank owned or controlled by a bank holding company to open, whether or not it had a charter or certificate to engage in banking. The District Court in this suit held that the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 reserved to the States final authority to bar subsidiaries of bank holding companies and that the Louisiana statute prevented the Comptroller from issuing the certificate. Accordingly, it issued a permanent injunction against the Comptroller. On appeal the Court of Appeals held that the new bank would be but a branch of the old one, which was prohibited by the Banking Act \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 412]\n\u00a0\n of 1933, and therefore found it unnecessary to rule on the effect of the new Louisiana law. Held: Since the issues here concern essentially the organization and relationship of the holding company and the new national bank, matters within the cognizance of the FRB rather than the Comptroller, upon whom the FRB's approval of a holding company plan is binding, the statutory scheme set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 - FRB determination, subject to review by a court of appeals - should be followed. The FRB should have an opportunity to consider the effect of the supervening Louisiana statute and the parties are given 60 days to proceed before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to secure a remand to the FRB. That court has ample power to protect its jurisdiction and prevent the opening of the new bank pending resolution of the issues.

Bell for the National Association of Supervisors of State Banks, and by Horace R. Hansen for the Independent Bankers Association.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis suit is a facet of the complicated controversy between the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans (Whitney-New Orleans) and three of its state-chartered \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n banking competitors over the establishment by Whitney-New Orleans of a national bank (Whitney-Jefferson) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, which adjoins the Parish of Orleans. In order to avoid the restrictions of the national banking laws as to branch banking\n1\n and still tap the banking market in Jefferson Parish, Whitney-New Orleans resorted to the organization of a bank holding company. After approval of the plan by the Federal Reserve Board on May 3, 1962, two of the respondent banks filed this declaratory judgment action on June 9, 1962, seeking a declaration that the Comptroller of the Currency had no power to grant the necessary authority and praying in addition for injunctive relief restraining him from issuing a certificate of authority for the new bank.\n\nFour days later two of the respondent banks petitioned the Board for reconsideration of its approval of the Whitney application. Their petition was denied, and on June 30, 1962, they sought judicial review of the Federal Reserve Board decision in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n2\n That suit is presently pending there awaiting our decision here.\n\nMeanwhile, in this suit the United States District Court for the District of Columbia assumed jurisdiction and held on the merits that 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956\n3\n reserved to the States final authority \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n to prohibit the opening of subsidiaries of bank holding companies within their borders and that Louisiana had adopted such a law (albeit subsequent to the approval of the plan involved here by the Federal Reserve Board)\n4\n which prevented the Comptroller from issuing the certificate. A permanent injunction was issued against the Comptroller restraining the issuance of the authority. 211 F. Supp. 576. On appeal the Court of Appeals upheld the jurisdiction of the District Court, rejecting the contention that the competitor banks lacked standing to sue. It related bank charters to semi-exclusive franchises conferring upon their holders a right to be free from the competition of a branch bank the operation of which was violative of the Banking Act of 1933, 12 U.S.C. 36 (1958 ed.). On the merits it concluded that the proposed Jefferson Parish bank would be but a branch of Whitney-New Orleans which was prohibited by the Act. It therefore found it unnecessary to pass upon the effect of Louisiana's law prohibiting the opening or operation of subsidiaries by bank holding companies. 116 U.S. App. D.C. 285, 323 F.2d 290. In view of the tangle in which the parties had thus involved themselves and the national banking laws as well, we granted certiorari. \n376 \nU.S. 948\n. We have concluded that the District Court for the District of Columbia had no jurisdiction to pass on the merits of the holding company proposal; that appropriate disposition of the controversy cannot be made without further consideration of the case by the Federal Reserve Board, where original exclusive jurisdiction rests; and that since the application for review of its decision is \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n now pending in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reasonable time should be allowed for that court to act. We, therefore, reverse these judgments and order dismissal of the complaint. But issuance of our judgment is stayed for a period of 60 days in order to give the parties time to move in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for an order remanding that case to the Federal Reserve Board; and, in the event of such a remand, to permit the Court of Appeals to issue such orders as will protect its jurisdiction pending final determination of the matter.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nThe facts are undisputed. Whitney-New Orleans desired to extend its banking business into the expanding urban areas beyond the Parish of Orleans, its home base. It could not open branches beyond the parish line because Louisiana law, La. Rev. Stat. 6:54 (1950), applicable to national banks, prohibited its operating a branch bank outside of its home parish. After discussions with the Deputy Comptroller of the Currency it was decided that the bank should establish a holding company (Whitney Holding Corporation) under federal law with a capital of $350,000 taken from the bank's undivided profits and represented by 5,600 shares of stock of the holding company to be distributed to the bank's shareholders. The holding company would then organize a new national bank, the Crescent City National Bank, with the $350,000 it had on hand. Whitney-New Orleans would then be merged into the Crescent City and the resulting bank would be known as Whitney-New Orleans. The new Whitney-New Orleans bank would declare a dividend of $650,000 from its undivided profits which would go to its owner, the holding company. The latter would then organize, with this $650,000, another national bank, Whitney-Jefferson, which would be located in Jefferson Parish. The net result of the maneuver would be that \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n the original stockholders of the old Whitney-New Orleans would own the holding company which in turn would own and operate both banks, i. e., the new Whitney-New Orleans and Whitney-Jefferson.\n\nApproval of the stockholders of Whitney-New Orleans was first obtained, over 88% of the shares voting for the plan. It was then submitted to the Comptroller who on October 3, 1961, gave preliminary approval, subject to the action of the Federal Reserve Board and the consummation of the various transactions outlined. On July 14, 1961, applications were filed with the Board; thereafter notice was published in the Federal Register and three potential competitors expressed opposition. However, none of the respondents appeared or made any filings. After receiving the advice of the Comptroller pursuant to 3 (b) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1842 (b) (1958 ed.), which was favorable, the Board ordered a public proceeding to be held on January 17, 1962, \"to afford further opportunity for the expression of views and opinions by interested persons.\" At this hearing testimony was heard and opposition submitted by objecting stockholders and potential competitors but none of the respondents took any part therein. The Board by a 6-1 vote approved the plan on May 3, 1962. This suit was filed on June 9, 1962. Thereafter on June 13, 1962, a petition for reconsideration was filed with the Federal Reserve Board by two of the respondent banks and was later joined by the Bank Commissioner of Louisiana. This application was denied on the ground of untimeliness and because the Board found it \"without substantial merit.\" The application for judicial review was then filed on June 30, 1962, with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit pursuant to 9 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1848 (1958 ed.). That case, as we have said, awaits our decision here. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring ownership or control of a national bank, new or existing, without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 12 U.S.C. 1842 (a) (1958 ed.). Provision is made for a full administrative proceeding before the Board in which all interested persons may participate and the views of the interested supervisory authorities may be obtained. 12 U.S.C. 1842 (b) (1958 ed.). The Board's determination is subject to judicial review by specified courts of appeals which must accept the administrative findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. 12 U.S.C. 1848 (1958 ed.).\n\nThus, if the plan here merely encompassed the acquisition of an existing national bank already enjoying the Comptroller's certificate of authority to do business, only the approval of the Board would be necessary, and the Comptroller would be involved only to the extent that he provided his views and recommendations. But, of course, this is not the case. Here it is a newly created national bank not yet authorized to do business that is sought to be organized and operated by a bank holding company. This authorization is the sole function of the Comptroller, requiring his appraisal of the bank's assets, directorate, etc., and his action is therefore necessary in addition to that of the Board approving the organization of the bank by the holding company. It is against this background that we inquire whether the questions raised by the respondents in the District Court against the Comptroller were cognizable by the Board.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWe think it clear that the thrust of respondents' complaint goes to the organization of Whitney-Jefferson by the holding company rather than merely the issuance of \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n authority to Whitney-Jefferson to do business. Respondents' chief contention is that Whitney-Jefferson would be but a branch bank of Whitney-New Orleans. But this would not follow simply by virtue of the issuance of authority for the opening of the new bank. Such a situation would occur, if at all, when the Board approved the holding company plan including the organization of Whitney-Jefferson as its subsidiary. Thus, it is the plan of organization by the holding company which lies at the heart of respondents' argument.\n\nThe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 directs the Board to consider both \"the convenience, needs, and welfare of the communities and the area concerned\" and \"whether or not the effect of such acquisition . . . would be to expand the size or extent of the bank holding company system involved beyond limits consistent with . . . the public interest . . . .\" 12 U.S.C. 1842 (c) (4) and (5) (1958 ed.). Clearly, if respondents' argument that Whitney-Jefferson would be a branch bank were sound, the Board would be compelled to disapprove the arrangement, for a plan of organization violative of federal law would hardly be consistent with the statutory command that no bank holding company should be expanded beyond the limits consistent with the public interest.\n\nThe respondents also argue that the operation of Whitney-Jefferson is barred by a valid state law prohibiting any subsidiary of a bank holding company from opening for business \"whether or not, a charter, permit, license or certificate to open for business has already been issued.\" Here, as with their first argument, respondents' quarrel is in actuality not merely with the opening of the bank, but rather with its opening as a subsidiary of Whitney Holding Corporation. Otherwise, the opening would not be prohibited by Louisiana law. Again, \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n the Board could not approve a holding company arrangement involving the organization and opening of a new bank if the opening of the bank, by reason of its ownership by a bank holding company, would be prohibited by a valid state law.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWe therefore conclude that respondents' complaint tenders issues cognizable by the Federal Reserve Board, and we turn to the question of whether such objections must first be raised there.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nWe believe Congress intended the statutory proceedings before the Board to be the sole means by which questions as to the organization or operation of a new bank by a bank holding company may be tested. Admittedly the acquisition of an existing bank is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Board. We know of no persuasive reason for finding a different procedure required where it is a new bank that is sought to be organized and operated simply because the Comptroller there performs a function in addition to that of the Board, i. e., the issuance of the certificate to do business.\n\nMoreover, the Bank Holding Company Act makes the Board's approval of a holding company arrangement binding upon the Comptroller. A provision designed to make the decision of the Comptroller, rather than that of the Board, final was rejected when the Act was being framed. 101 Cong. Rec. 8186-8187. This legislative history clearly indicates that Congress had no intention to give the Comptroller a veto over the Board in such cases. It follows that it is the exclusive function of the Board to act in such cases and contests must be pursued \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 420]\n\u00a0\n before it, not before the Comptroller. This position is also supported by legislative history which shows that Congress rejected a proposal for a de novo review in the district courts of Board decisions on holding company proposals. Compare 12 U.S.C. 1848 (1958 ed.) and S. Rep. No. 1095, pt. 1, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 9, and pt. 2, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 5, with 9 of H. R. 6227, 101 Cong. Rec. 8187, and H. R. Rep. No. 609, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 22, 25-26. Such a procedure would have been similar to that employed here against the Comptroller by respondents. However, the Congress decided otherwise, providing instead for review in the courts of appeals based on the facts found by the Board supported by substantial evidence. We think these congressional actions point clearly to the conclusion that it intended that challenges to Board approval of the organization and operation of a new bank by a bank holding company be pursued solely as provided in the statute.\n\nThis view is confirmed by our cases holding that where Congress has provided statutory review procedures designed to permit agency expertise to be brought to bear on particular problems, those procedures are to be exclusive. See, e. g., Callanan Road Improvement Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 507\n (1953); Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n (1938); Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n (1907). Congress has set out in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 a carefully planned and comprehensive method for challenging Board determinations. That action by Congress was designed to permit an agency, expert in banking matters, to explore and pass on the ramifications of a proposed bank holding company arrangement. To permit a district court to make the initial determination of a plan's propriety would substantially decrease the effectiveness of the statutory design. As we stated in \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 421]\n\u00a0\n Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570\n (1952):\n\n\"[I]n cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.\" At 574-575.\n\n\n Here the Court of Appeals held that the relationship of Whitney-Jefferson to Whitney-New Orleans would be that of a branch bank notwithstanding the fact that they were organized under a bank holding company arrangement. The District Court found the proposal barred by Louisiana Act No. 275 of 1962. We believe that these are the very types of questions that Congress has committed to the Board, and we hold that the Board should make the determination of the plan's propriety in the first instance. The soundness of this conclusion is especially evident when it is remembered that the Board has played a vital role in the development of the national banking laws, a role which makes its views of particular benefit to the courts where ultimately the validity of the arrangement will be tested.\n\nMoreover, we reject the notion that the Board's determination may be collaterally attacked in the District \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 422]\n\u00a0\n Court by a suit against the Comptroller. Opponents of the opening of a new bank by a bank holding company must first attack the arrangement before the Board, subject only to review by the Courts of Appeals. City of Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, \n357 \nU.S. 320\n (1958); United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435\n (1936). That Congress has not expressly provided that the statutory procedure is to be exclusive does not require a different conclusion. For Congress has expressly rejected proposed provisions for review in these cases in the district courts. Moreover, it has enacted a specific statutory scheme for obtaining review, and where Congress has directed such a procedure as that found in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies comes into play and requires that the statutory mode of review be adhered to notwithstanding the absence of an express statutory command of exclusiveness.\n\nA rejection of this doctrine here would result in unnecessary duplication and conflicting litigation. Some opponents might participate before the Board; others might well wait for termination of the Board's activities and then sue in the district courts for an injunction accomplishing the same ultimate end. The different records, applications of different standards and conflicting determinations that would surely result from such duplicative procedures all militate in favor of the conclusion that the statutory steps provided in the Act are exclusive.\n\nRespondents attempt to ground support for the District Court's asserted jurisdiction on the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1001, 1009 (1958 ed.), which provides that \"Every . . . final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court shall be subject to judicial review. . . .\" The short answer to this, of course, is, as we have pointed out, that the Comptroller's action in issuing a certificate is not \"final\"; it is \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 423]\n\u00a0\n the action of the Board permitting consummation of the organization of the new bank by the holding company that is final, and its decision is subject to review only in the courts of appeals, not before the Comptroller or in the district courts.\n\nFurthermore, the respondents contend that no provisions for review of the Comptroller's decision are included in any of the pertinent Acts; indeed, they say, he has admitted as much in this case. Respondents again overlook the fact that the decision here approving the organization of the Whitney-Jefferson Bank is not for the Comptroller. He only checks the condition of the new bank, its capital, directorate, etc., as provided by the National Bank Act. 12 U.S.C. 26 (1958 ed.). That the action of the Comptroller is not final is made crystal-clear here where, assuming he should issue the desired authority to Whitney-Jefferson to open for business, it would be completely negated in the event that on review the Board's approval of the holding company plan was reversed. As we have said, it is the ownership of Whitney-Jefferson by the holding company that is at the heart of the project, not the permission to open for business which is acted upon routinely by the Comptroller once the authority to organize is given by the Board.\n\nWe do not say that under no circumstances may the Comptroller be restrained in equity from issuing a certificate to a new bank. We do hold, however, that where a bank holding company seeks to open a new bank pursuant to a plan of organization the propriety of which must, under the Bank Holding Company Act, be determined by the Board, the statutory review procedure set out in the Act must be utilized by those dissatisfied with the Board's ruling despite the fact that the Comptroller's certificate is a necessary prerequisite to the opening of the bank. Otherwise the commands of the Congress would be completely frustrated. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 424]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nIt is for this reason that the Fifth Circuit case reviewing the Board's former action should be remanded to it. Section 3 (5) of Louisiana Act No. 275 of 1962, La. Rev. Stat. 6:1003 (5) (1962 Supp.), provides that \"It shall be unlawful . . . for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof to open for business any bank not now opened for business, whether or not, a charter, permit, license or certificate to open for business has already been issued. . . .\"\n6\n This Act was passed on July 10, 1962, several days after the Board denied respondents' petition for reconsideration. It was not considered by the Board as one of the factors in the application for registration as a bank holding company. The petition for review, attacking the Board's determination before the Fifth Circuit, is, of course, not before this Court. Nevertheless it is perfectly obvious that the two cases are closely related. We have discussed earlier the importance which Congress has attached in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to the principle that the Federal Reserve Board, with its expertise in the banking field, should make the initial determination of the propriety of the plan of organization giving full consideration to the legislative guidelines set out in the Act. Section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1846 (1958 ed.), provides:\n\n \"The enactment by the Congress of this chapter shall not be construed as preventing any State from exercising such powers and jurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to banks, bank holding companies, and subsidiaries thereof.\" \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 425]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Here the Board has not had an opportunity to determine the applicability and effect of the new Louisiana statute. We are of the opinion that this is the very type of question that Congress envisioned as being resolved in the first instance by the Board. In line with this legislative policy, and in the interest of judicial economy and proper administrative practice, the Board should have an opportunity to act in the light of Louisiana's new law. It is for this reason that we give the parties not exceeding 60 days to proceed before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to secure such a remand.\n\nIt appears from the record that the Comptroller advised the District Court that \"if the preliminary injunction entered herein is vacated, and if Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish so requests, inasmuch as upon a careful examination of the facts within my knowledge it appears that such association is lawfully entitled to commence the business of banking, it is my present intention to issue such certificate.\" R. 310. Our disposition, however, does not free the Comptroller to authorize the opening of the bank, for the Court of Appeals has the power to prevent the issuance of the certificate pending final disposition of the matter. As the Comptroller himself notes, the certificate may issue only when the applicant is \"lawfully entitled to commence the business of banking.\" It would not be \"lawfully entitled\" to open in the event the Court of Appeals stayed the order of approval of the Federal Reserve Board pending final disposition of the review proceeding. The court, of course, is empowered under 28 U.S.C. 1651 (1958 ed.) to do so. See Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, \n316 \nU.S. 4\n (1942); Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System v. Transamerica Corp., 184 F.2d 311 (1950). In the event such a stay were issued we feel certain that the Comptroller would not \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 426]\n\u00a0\n attempt to issue the certificate.\n7\n But if he did and the Court of Appeals should find it necessary to take direct action to maintain the status quo and prevent the opening of the bank, it has ample power to do so. The Whitney Holding Corporation, a party presently before the Fifth Circuit, owns and controls both banks and through it the court could reach the technical applicant, Whitney-Jefferson. We think it clear that the Court of Appeals can appropriately fashion an order designed to compel Whitney Holding Corporation not only to refrain from acting itself but to require that its subsidiary refrain from requesting the certificate and from opening the bank. Indeed, upon proper application by the respondents the Court of Appeals could stay the hand of Whitney-Jefferson itself since it is within the jurisdiction of that court. It is sufficient to say here that the Fifth Circuit's power to protect its jurisdiction is beyond question.\n\nIn the instant proceedings, the judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with direction to dismiss the complaint. Issuance of our judgment is stayed for 60 days to afford the parties opportunity to proceed as outlined in this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] La. Rev. Stat. 6:54 (1950) prohibits banks from opening branch offices in parishes other than their home parish, and these geographical limitations are made applicable to national banks by 23 of the Banking Act of 1933, 12 U.S.C. 36 (c) (2) (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 9 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1848 (1958 ed.) provides for review of Federal Reserve Board action in the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 12 U.S.C. 1846 (1958 ed.) provides:\n\n\"The enactment by the Congress of this chapter shall not be construed as preventing any State from exercising such powers and jurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to banks, bank holding companies, and subsidiaries thereof.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Board approval was on May 3, 1962, while Louisiana Act No. 275 of 1962, La. Rev. Stat. 6:1001-6:1006 (1962 Supp.), did not become effective until July 10, 1962, at which time the Board's approval was not final, being on review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bank of New Orleans & Trust Co. et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, No. 19788 (C. A. 5th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Board has indicated that in its view 7 of the Act permits the States to prohibit the formation of bank holding companies. See Trans-Nebraska Co., 49 Fed. Res.

Obviously if the holding company application has not been acted upon by the Board, the Comptroller would have no power to issue the certificate and his persistence in doing so would subject him to the temporary orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nSuch an action would not require an impermissible collateral attack on the merits of the proposal, which are reserved for the Board. Its sole purpose would be to prevent the Comptroller from acting without the Board's approval - an objective that would protect the jurisdiction of the reviewing court of appeals rather than run afoul of it. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nI dissent from the ruling of the Court that the District Court for the District of Columbia has no jurisdiction over this present controversy with the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nTwo federal agencies are involved in this bank acquisition program:\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to grant or deny an application by a holding company of the right to acquire the shares of any bank. 12 U.S.C. 1842.\n\nThe Comptroller of the Currency has jurisdiction under the National Bank Act to license the opening of a banking operation where it appears that the applicant \"is lawfully entitled to commence the business of banking.\" 12 U.S.C. 27.\n\nIt is thus apparent that the two administrative proceedings involve different, though related, matters; different, though related, applicants; and different, though related, issues.\n\nThe decision of the Board is subject to review in the Court of Appeals as provided in 12 U.S.C. 1848. But, as stated by the Solicitor General, \"The National Bank Act . . . makes no provision for an administrative hearing or for judicial review, and the Comptroller's decisions are made informally, without an administrative record.\" The courts, however, have held that judicial cognizance of a controversy with the Comptroller may be taken and judicial power exercised to keep the Comptroller within statutory bounds. Camden Trust Co. v. Gidney, 112 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 301 F.2d 521; Union Savings Bank v. Saxon, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 296, 298, 335 F.2d 718, 720, and cases cited. That conclusion is consistent with our holding in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407, 423\n-424, that, absent a congressional \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 428]\n\u00a0\n design to bar all judicial review (Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n), injunctive relief is available where administrative remedies are either inapplicable or inadequate. This rule keeps the Comptroller from being a free-wheeling agency dispensing federal favors; and it gives some assurance that he will render principled decisions within the rule of law laid down by Congress.\n\nThe facts of this case dramatize the importance of the jurisdiction of the District Court. Shortly after the Board's final action in this case, and before review of its action by the Court of Appeals had been sought, Louisiana passed a law (La. Rev. Stat. 6:1001 to 6:1006 (1962 Supp.)) which provides in pertinent part: \"It shall be unlawful . . . for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof to open for business any bank not now opened for business . . . .\" The Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1846, specifically reserves to the States a broad power seemingly sufficient to bar bank holding companies or their subsidiaries from extending their domains.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIn spite of the pending review of the Board's order in the Court of Appeals and in spite of the intervening Louisiana law, the Comptroller on August 9, 1962, advised the District Court in affidavit form:\n\n \"Upon consideration of these subsequent developments, and after careful examination of the Louisiana statute, I have concluded that there has occurred no reason to alter the Comptroller's prior determination \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 429]\n\u00a0\n that a certificate of authority should be issued to Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 27.\n\n\n \"Accordingly, if the preliminary injunction entered herein is vacated, and if Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish so requests, inasmuch as upon a careful examination of the facts within my knowledge it appears that such association is lawfully entitled to commence the business of banking, it is my present intention to issue such certificate.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n This threat makes a mockery of the Solicitor General's assurance that the parties have a full and adequate remedy in the Court of Appeals review of the Board's order and of his position that the present suit is designed as a collateral attack on the review of that order. For without the injunction issued by the District Court the Comptroller candidly states that the new branch bank \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 430]\n\u00a0\n would be in business, flouting the new Louisiana law, whose prototype we have already sustained.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe ruling of the Court that the District Court had no jurisdiction in this case promises serious consequences. It means there may be an hiatus during which the Comptroller can take the law into his own hands without restraint from anyone. The Court looks to the Court of Appeals to give protection during that hiatus. In this case the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approved the holding company application on May 3, 1962. The action in the District Court was filed on June 9, 1962. But judicial review of the Board's action by the Court of Appeals was not sought until June 30, 1962.\n\nIf respondents had accelerated their review of the Board's action, they still would not have had any protection against the Comptroller for he was not a party to the action in the Court of Appeals; and as the record shows if he had been freed from the restraint of the District Court, his alliance with Whitney-Jefferson would have resulted in a flouting of the law.\n\nWhitney-Jefferson, moreover, was not a party in the Fifth Circuit proceeding. Nor will either the applicant \"branch bank\" or the holding company normally be a party to the appeal in the Court of Appeals. The statute providing for judicial review of a Board order at the instance of the \"party aggrieved\" does not make them parties. 12 U.S.C. 1848. The governing rule of the Court \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 431]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says that the \"agency, board, commission or officer concerned shall be named as respondent\"; but it is nowhere provided that those who were successful before the board or agency shall also be made respondents. Rule 39, 28 U.S.C.A. As it happens, Whitney Holding Corporation seems to have intervened in the appeal to support the Board. But this is a fortuitous circumstance. After today's decision it will no doubt occur to those who find themselves in Whitney's position that possibly they may, with the help of the Comptroller, be able to open their doors for business in defiance of state law simply by staying out of the review proceeding in the Court of Appeals and keeping their holding company master out of it also. Perhaps, as the Court suggests, the Court of Appeals will always be able to find the means to prevent such an eventuality by resort to 28 U.S.C. 1651; perhaps it will not. But there can be no doubt that maintenance of the jurisdiction of the District Court is essential both for keeping the dual jurisdiction of the Board and of the Comptroller from a collision course and for keeping the Comptroller within bounds of the law.\n\nI also dissent from remitting the constitutionality of the Louisiana Act to the Federal Reserve Board and thus giving administrative \"expertise\" new and surprising dimensions.\n\nHeretofore we have remitted causes to federal agencies where \"issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges\" are raised or where the case requires \"the exercise of administrative discretion.\" Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570, 574\n. Here the facts are known and the bare, bald question of the constitutionality of Louisiana's law is tendered. It is presented in this action in the District Court; the Comptroller threatens to flout that law; yet if it is a valid law, the new bank is not \"lawfully entitled to commence the \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 432]\n\u00a0\n business of banking\" within the meaning of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 27. I would decide that issue here and now.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 7 of the Act reads as follows:\n\n\"The enactment by the Congress of this chapter shall not be construed as preventing any State from exercising such powers and jurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to banks, bank holding companies, and subsidiaries thereof.\" 12 U.S.C. 1846.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Comptroller and the applicant bank, Whitney-Jefferson, made a speedy accommodation as shown in Whitney-Jefferson's brief in this Court:\n\n\"On May 10, 1962, Whitney-Jefferson executed and delivered to the new Comptroller of the Currency its articles of association and its certificate of organization, thereby establishing its corporate existence as a national banking association in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 24. On May 18, 1962, the Comptroller approved the final corporate formalities necessary to complete the program. On May 24, 1962, the duly elected and qualified directors of Whitney-Jefferson adopted by-laws and took action by which the new bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\n\"Thereafter, the sole remaining legal step necessary to permit the opening of Whitney-Jefferson for business was the issuance to it by the Comptroller, under 12 U.S.C. 27, of a certificate authorizing it to commence the business of banking. The Comptroller was about to issue such a certificate when this action was commenced on June 9, 1962. Whitney-Jefferson was prepared to open its doors for business, and would have commenced operations virtually as soon as it received a certificate.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Braeburn Securities Corp. v. Smith, 15 Ill. 2d 55, 153 N. E. 2d 806, where a state statute forbade holding-company shareholders from acquiring stock of national banks. We dismissed the appeal \"for want of a substantial federal question.\" \n359 \nU.S. 311\n. Accord: Trans-Nebraska Co., 49 Fed. Res. Bull. 633, 638 (1963). That decision was in line with federal policy of making state law the standard when it comes to certain kinds of branch banking. See United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, \n374 \nU.S. 321, 328\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nFor the reasons given in his dissenting opinion, I agree with my Brother DOUGLAS that the District Court has jurisdiction over this controversy and that the question of the Louisiana Act's constitutionality should not be remitted to the Federal Reserve Board, and I join his dissent on both those points. I would go further, however, and affirm the District Court's judgment. As pointed out in MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS' dissent, Louisiana now has a law making it unlawful for any bank holding company to open for business in that State and Congress has consented for States to pass such a law. Accordingly, neither the Comptroller nor the Federal Reserve Board has power to permit the Whitney Holding Corporation to open a bank in Louisiana. Under these circumstances there is no reason whatever, except an entirely technical one, to let the litigation over this matter proceed any further. I would therefore end it by affirming the judgments of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the District Court, a disposition which would, of course, call for a dismissal of the related controversy now pending in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n\n[379 \nU.S. 411, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","234":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWMCA, INC. v.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court today disposes summarily of four New York reapportionment cases; it retains jurisdiction of a fifth, Lomenzo v. WMCA, Inc., No. 81, which raises substantial questions similar to some of those involved in a set of Hawaii reapportionment cases, Burns v. Richardson, No. 318; Cravalho v. Richardson, No. 323; and Abe v. Richardson, No. 409, with respect to which probable \n\n[382 \nU.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction has been noted (post, p. 807). Because these cryptic dispositions risk bewildering the New York legislators and courts, let alone those of other States, I believe it fitting to elucidate my understanding of these dispositions, all of which I join on the premises herein indicated. The need for clarification is particularly desirable because, through dismissal of the appeal in Rockefeller v. Orans, No. 319, and affirmance in WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, No. 85, this Court signifies its approval of two decisions concerning the same apportionment plan, one of which (No. 85) found it acceptable and the other of which (No. 319) struck it down.\n\nThe New York Legislature adopted an apportionment plan, known as \"Plan A,\"\n1\n to comply with an order of a three-judge District Court, dated July 27, 1964, requiring the State to enact \"a valid apportionment scheme that is in compliance with the XIV Amendment of the United States Constitution and which shall be implemented so as to effect the election of Members of the Legislature at the election in November, 1965, Members so elected to hold office for a term of one year ending December 31, 1966 . . . .\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 238 F. Supp. 916, the three-judge court found that Plan A satisfied this order; \n\n[382 \nU.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n in so doing it rejected contentions that apportioning on a basis of citizen population violates the Federal Constitution, and that partisan \"gerrymandering\" may be subject to federal constitutional attack under the Fourteenth Amendment. In affirming this decision, this Court necessarily affirms these two eminently correct principles.\n\nQuite evidently Plan A was seen by the District Court, and is also viewed by this Court, as but a temporary measure. In holding the plan federally acceptable for the purpose of electing a special 1966 Legislature, the District Court explicitly abstained from dealing with challenges to the plan under the State Constitution. Judge Waterman also noted that although Plan A met federal constitutional requirements, \"Of course, the ultimate fitness of the scheme for their needs and purposes is for the people of the State of New York, themselves, to decide, and not for this court to mandate.\" 238 F. Supp., at 927.\n\nSubsequent to the decision below in WMCA, the New York Court of Appeals held Plan A (as well as Plans B, C, and D) unconstitutional as a matter of state law.\n3\n In now dismissing for lack of a substantial federal question the appeal from that decision (Rockefeller v. Orans, No. 319) insofar as it may bear upon any apportionment plan effective after the expiration of the 1966 New York Legislature, I take it that the Court is asserting that any final apportionment plan must comport with state as well as \n\n[382 \nU.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n federal constitutional requirements.\n4\n So much of the disposition in No. 319 I join without reservation. In dismissing, without more, the remaining part of that appeal, I take it that the Court is simply reflecting its affirmances in Nos. 191 and 449 (post, pp. 9. 11), whereby it puts its stamp of approval on the District Court's use of Plan A, though invalid under the New York Constitution, as a temporary measure. I acquiesce in this aspect of the disposition because of factors to which I advert below.\n\nThe Court affirms as well two appeals, Travia v. Lomenzo, No. 191, and Screvane v. Lomenzo, No. 449, from the District Court's order of May 24, 1965, which specifically ordered a November 1965 special election under Plan A after the New York Court of Appeals had already declared that plan to be in violation of the State Constitution.\n5\n On June 1, 1965, this Court denied a motion to stay the order and to accelerate the appeal, Travia v. Lomenzo, \n381 \nU.S. 431\n. In dissent I noted that a federal court order that a state election be held under a plan declared invalid under the State Constitution by the highest court of that State surely presented issues of far-reaching importance for the smooth functioning of our federal system, which were deserving of plenary consideration by this Court. I would have accelerated the appeal, and but for the action of this Court in denying the stay which was sought I would have granted the further application for such a stay that was \n\n[382 \nU.S. 4, 8]\n\u00a0\n made to me during the summer. Travia v. Lomenzo, No. 191, Memorandum of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, July 16, 1965, 86 S. Ct. 7. I now acquiesce in the affirmance\n6\n as I can see no satisfactory way to heal, at this juncture, the wounds to federal-state relations caused by the District Court's order without inflicting even greater ones.\n\nThe upshot of what is done today is, then, to suspend New York's 150-member constitutional provision for the one-year duration of the 1966 Legislature, a result to which I subscribe only under the compulsion of what has gone before in this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [This opinion applies also to No. 191, Travia et al. v. Lomenzo, Secretary of State of New York, et al.; No. 319, Rockefeller, Governor of New York, et al. v. Orans et al.; and No. 449, Screvane, President of City Council of City of New York, et al. v.

The District Court in the same opinion that found Plan A constitutional, WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 238 F. Supp. 916, also held that Plans B, C, and D did not meet the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Reynolds v. Sims, \n377 \nU.S. 533\n, and WMCA, Inc. v.

III, 2, of the New York Constitution which states, \"The assembly shall consist of one hundred and fifty members.\" All four plans provided for larger assemblies: Plan A, 165 assemblymen, c. 976, 301; Plan B, 180 assemblymen, c. 977, 301; Plan C, 186 assemblymen (having a total of 165 votes), c. 979, 301; Plan D, 174 assemblymen (having a total of 150 votes), c. 981, 301.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court's dismissal of this part of the appeal in No. 319 necessarily approves the Court of Appeals' holding that from the standpoint of federal law the 150-member requirement of the New York Constitution was not an integral part of the apportionment scheme invalidated in WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, \n377 \nU.S. 633\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The May 24, 1965, order of the District Court was in oral form.

The appeal from the three-judge District Court is brought here under 28 U.S.C. 1253 (1964 ed.), and I do not believe this case, or a fortiori any of the other New York reapportionment cases presently before the Court, is moot. Surely if this Court now held that the District Court erred in ordering the election under Plan A, it has the power, for example, to enjoin the November 2 election and to order the District Court to arrange for yet another election and for other appropriate temporary reapportionment relief. The very great difficulties implicit in affording any such relief at this late stage go to the question of its desirability, not to the mootness of the underlying action. \n\n[382 \nU.S. 4, 9]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","235":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZEMEL v.

In addition, he prayed that the Secretary and the Attorney General be enjoined from interfering with such travel.

Pp. 8-11.\n\n\n  (b) In 1952 Congress enacted legislation relating to passports, but despite the many executive impositions of area restrictions it left untouched the broad rule-making authority granted in the Passport Act of 1926.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe questions for decision are whether the Secretary of State is statutorily authorized to refuse to validate the passports of United States citizens for travel to Cuba, and, if he is, whether the exercise of that authority is constitutionally permissible. We answer both questions in the affirmative.\n\nPrior to 1961 no passport was required for travel anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. On January 3 of that year, the United States broke diplomatic and consular relations with Cuba. On January 16 the Department of State eliminated Cuba from the area for which passports were not required, and declared all outstanding United States passports (except those held by persons already in Cuba) to be invalid for travel to or in Cuba \"unless specifically endorsed for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State.\" A companion press release stated that the Department contemplated granting exceptions to \"persons whose travel may be regarded as being in the best interests of the United States, such as newsmen or businessmen with previously established business interests.\"\n\nThrough an exchange of letters in early 1962, appellant, a citizen of the United States and holder of an otherwise valid passport, applied to the State Department to have his passport validated for travel to Cuba as a tourist. His \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n request was denied. On October 30, 1962, he renewed the request, stating that the purpose of the proposed trip was \"to satisfy my curiosity about the state of affairs in Cuba and to make me a better informed citizen.\" The request again was denied, on the ground that the purpose of the trip did not meet the previously prescribed standards for such travel.\n\nOn December 7, 1962, appellant instituted this suit against the Secretary of State and the Attorney General in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking a judgment declaring: (1) that he was entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to travel to Cuba and to have his passport validated for that purpose; (2) that his travel to Cuba and the use of his passport for that purpose would not violate any statute, regulation, or passport restriction; (3) that the Secretary's restrictions upon travel to Cuba were invalid; (4) that the Passport Act of 1926 and 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 were unconstitutional; (5) that the Secretary's refusal to grant him a passport valid for Cuba violated rights guaranteed him by the Constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights; and (6) that denial of the passport endorsement without a formal hearing violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n1\n The complaint also requested that the Secretary be directed to validate appellant's passport for travel to Cuba and that the Secretary and the Attorney General be enjoined from interfering with such travel. In his amended complaint. appellant added to his constitutional attack on the 1926 and 1952 Acts a prayer that the Secretary and the Attorney General be enjoined from enforcing them.\n\nOn appellant's motion and over the objection of appellees, a three-judge court was convened. On cross-motions \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n for summary judgment, the court, by a divided vote, granted the Secretary of State's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action against the Attorney General, 228 F. Supp. 65 (D.C. D. Conn. 1964). We postponed consideration of the jurisdictional question to the hearing of the case on the merits, \n379 \nU.S. 809\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nA direct appeal to this Court from a district court lies under 28 U.S.C. 1253 (1958 ed.) only \"from an order granting or denying . . . an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.\" Thus we must deal first with the Government's contention that a three-judge court was improperly convened, for if the contention is correct, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246, 248\n.\n\nSection 2282 of Title 28 of the United States Code requires the impanelling of a three-judge court in any case where the relief sought is \"[a]n interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution of the United States . . . .\" On its face, appellant's amended complaint, by calling upon the court below to enjoin the enforcement of the Passport Act of 1926 and 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, on the ground that those statutes are unconstitutional, meets the requirements of 2282. The Solicitor General notes that appellant would be accorded full relief by the voiding of the Secretary's order. It is true that appellant's argument - that either the Secretary's order is not supported by the authority granted him by Congress, or the statutes granting that authority are unconstitutional - is two-pronged. But we have often held that a \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n litigant need not abandon his nonconstitutional arguments in order to obtain a three-judge court: \"the joining in the complaint of a nonconstitutional attack along with the constitutional one does not dispense with the necessity to convene such a court.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe Solicitor General apparently conceding - as all three judges below agreed - that appellant's Fifth Amendment attack is substantial. cf. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116, 125\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n. 505-506, argues that it is in reality an attack upon an administrative, as opposed to a legislative, policy, and therefore, under cases like Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246\n, and Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n, a three-judge court need not have been convened. We need not evaluate this contention for appellant's complaint also attacks the 1926 and 1952 Acts on the ground that \"they contain no standards and are therefore an invalid delegation of legislative power.\" This allegation cannot be brushed aside as an attack upon the actions of the Secretary; in arguing invalid delegation, appellant has quite clearly assailed the statutes themselves. The Solicitor General therefore meets the delegation argument on another ground: by labeling it \"frivolous.\" Although we do not accept appellant's delegation argument, infra, pp. 17-18, we cannot agree that it is so insubstantial as to compel a district court to read it out of the complaint and refuse to convene a three-judge court. Compare William Jameson & Co. v. Morgenthau, \n307 \nU.S. 171\n; Schneider v. Rusk, \n372 \nU.S. 224\n. Indeed, we explicitly noted in Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 129, that if we had held that the Secretary's refusal to issue a passport to petitioner in that case was supported by the 1926 and 1952 Acts, we would \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n then have been obliged to consider whether those Acts were void for invalid delegation.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe complaint therefore launches a substantial constitutional attack upon two federal statutes, and prays that their operation be enjoined. Cf. Idlewild Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, \n370 \nU.S. 713, 715\n. We hold that the three-judge court was properly convened, and that we therefore have jurisdiction over the appeal.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe think that the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. 211a (1958 ed.), embodies a grant of authority to the Executive to refuse to validate the passports of United States citizens for travel to Cuba. That Act provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\"The Secretary of State may grant and issue passports . . . under such rules as the President shall \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States . . . .\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n This provision is derived from 23 of the Act of August 18, 1856, 11 Stat. 52, 60-61, which had, prior to 1926, been re-enacted several times without substantial change. The legislative history of the 1926 Act and its predecessors does not, it is true, affirmatively indicate an intention to authorize area restrictions. However, its language is surely broad enough to authorize area restrictions, and there is no legislative history indicating an intent to exclude such restrictions from the grant of authority; these factors take on added significance when viewed in light of the fact that during the decade preceding the passage of the Act, the Executive had imposed both peacetime and wartime area restrictions. As a result of a famine in Belgium in 1915, the State Department stopped issuing passports for use in that country except to \"applicants obliged to go thither by special exigency or authorized by Red Cross or Belgian Relief Commission.\" III Hackworth, Digest of International Law, p. 526 (1942). Beginning December 9, 1914, and continuing through World War I, passports were validated only for specific purposes and specific countries. No passports were issued for travel in Germany and Austria until July 18, 1922, and none for the Soviet Union until approximately September 1923. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Department of State Passport Policies, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 63-64. The use in the 1926 Act of language broad enough to permit executive imposition of area restrictions, after the Executive had several times in the recent past openly asserted the power to impose such restrictions under predecessor statutes containing substantially the same language, supports the conclusion that Congress intended in 1926 to maintain in the Executive the authority to make such restrictions.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThis construction of the Act is reinforced by the State Department's continued imposition of area restrictions during both times of war and periods of peace since 1926. For a period of about seven months following the outbreak of war between Italy and Ethiopia in 1935, the Department declined to issue passports for travel in Ethiopia, except to journalists, Red Cross representatives, and others able to show a \"compelling exigency\" necessitating such travel. In cases where persons did not include Ethiopia in their applications, but were - by reason of the mention in their applications of adjacent countries - suspected of intending to travel therein, their passports were stamped \"not valid for use in Ethiopia.\" III Hackworth, supra, pp. 531-532. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, passports were stamped \"not valid for travel in Spain,\" with exceptions for newspapermen and persons furnishing medical assistance. Id., at 533-534. A similar restriction was placed on travel to China in August 1937, in view of \"the disturbed situation in the Far East.\" Passports were validated for travel to China only \"in exceptional circumstances,\" and in no case for women or children. Id., at 532-533. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 31, 1938, the President, purporting to act pursuant to the 1926 Act, specifically authorized the Secretary to impose area restrictions in the issuance of passports, Exec. Order No. 7856, 3 Fed. Reg. 681, 687:\n\n\"The Secretary of State is authorized in his discretion to refuse to issue a passport to restrict a passport for use only in certain countries to restrict it against use in certain countries, to withdraw or cancel a passport already issued and to withdraw a passport for the purpose of restricting its validity or use in certain countries.\"\n\n\n This Executive Order is still in force. 22 CFR 51.75. In September 1939, travel to Europe was prohibited except with a passport specially validated for such travel; passports were so validated only upon a showing of the \"imperativeness\" of the travel. Departmental Order No. 811, 4 Fed. Reg. 3892.\n\nArea restrictions have also been imposed on numerous occasions since World War II. Travel to Yugoslavia was restricted in the late 1940's as a result of a series of incidents involving American citizens. Dept. State Press Conf., May 9, 1947. Travel to Hungary was restricted between December 1949 and May 1951, and after December 1951.\n7\n In June 1951, the State Department began to stamp passports \"not valid for travel in Czechoslovakia,\" and declared that all passports outstanding at that time were not valid for such travel. 24 Dept. State Bull. 932. In May 1952, the Department issued a general order that all new passports would be stamped not valid for travel to Albania, Bulgaria, Communist China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and the Soviet Union. 26 id., at 736. In October 1955, the Secretary announced that passports would no longer require special validation \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n for travel to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and the Soviet Union, but would be stamped invalid for travel \"to the following areas under control of authorities with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations: Albania, Bulgaria, and those portions of China, Korea and Viet-Nam under communist control.\" 33 id., at 777. In February 1956, the restriction on travel to Hungary was reimposed. 34 id., at 246-248. And in late 1956, passports were for a brief period stamped invalid for travel to or in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Syria. 35 id., at 756.\n\nEven if there had been no passport legislation enacted since the 1926 Act, the post-1926 history of executive imposition of area restrictions, as well as the pre-1926 history, would be of relevance to our construction of the Act. The interpretation expressly placed on a statute by those charged with its administration must be given weight by courts faced with the task of construing the statute. Udall v. Tallman, \n380 \nU.S. 1, 16\n-18; Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294, 315\n. Under some circumstances, Congress' failure to repeal or revise in the face of such administrative interpretation has been held to constitute persuasive evidence that that interpretation is the one intended by Congress.\n8\n In this case, however, the inference is supported by more than mere congressional inaction. For in 1952 Congress, substantially re-enacting laws which had been passed during the First and Second World Wars,\n9\n provided that after the issuance of a presidential proclamation of war or national emergency, it would be unlawful to leave or enter the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n United States without a valid passport. Section 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 190, 8 U.S.C. 1185 (1958 ed.). The Solicitor General urges that in view of the issuance in 1953 of a presidential proclamation of national emergency which is still outstanding,\n10\n travel in violation of an area restriction imposed on an otherwise valid passport is unlawful under the 1952 Act. The correctness of this interpretation is a question we do not reach on this appeal, see infra, pp. 18-20. But whether or not the new legislation was intended to attach criminal penalties to the violation of area restrictions, it certainly was not meant to cut back upon the power to impose such restrictions. Despite 26 years of executive interpretation of the 1926 Act as authorizing the imposition of area restrictions. Congress in 1952, though it once again enacted legislation relating to passports, left completely untouched the broad rule-making authority granted in the earlier Act. Cf. Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, supra, at 313.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThis case is therefore not like Kent v. Dulles, supra, where we were unable to find, with regard to the sort of passport refusal involved there, an administrative practice sufficiently substantial and consistent to warrant the conclusion that Congress had implicitly approved it. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n Appellant reminds us that in summarizing the Secretary's practice in Kent, we observed:\n\n\"So far as material here, the cases of refusal of passports generally fell into two categories. First, questions pertinent to the citizenship of the applicant and his allegiance to the United States had to be resolved by the Secretary . . . . Second, was the question whether the applicant was participating in illegal conduct, trying to escape the toils of the law, promoting passport frauds, or otherwise engaging in conduct which would violate the laws of the United States.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 127\n.\n\n\n It must be remembered, in reading this passage, that the issue involved in Kent was whether a citizen could be denied a passport because of his political beliefs or associations. In finding that history did not support the position of the Secretary in that case, we summarized that history \"so far as material here\" - that is, so far as material to passport refusals based on the character of the particular applicant. In this case, however, the Secretary has refused to validate appellant's passport not because of any characteristic peculiar to appellant, but rather because of foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nHaving concluded that the Secretary of State's refusal to validate appellant's passport for travel to Cuba is supported by the authority granted by Congress in the Passport Act of 1926, we must next consider whether that refusal abridges any constitutional right of appellant. Although we do not in this case reach the question of whether the 1952 Act should be read to attach criminal penalties to travel to an area for which one's passport is not validated, we must, if we are to approach the constitutional issues presented by this appeal candidly, proceed \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n on the assumption that the Secretary's refusal to validate a passport for a given area acts as a deterrent to travel to that area. In Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 125, we held that \"[t]he right to travel is a part of the `liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\" See also Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra, at 505-506. However, the fact that a liberty cannot be inhibited without due process of law does not mean that it can under no circumstances be inhibited.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe requirements of due process are a function not only of the extent of the governmental restriction imposed,\n13\n but also of the extent of the necessity for the restriction. Cuba is the only area in the Western Hemisphere controlled by a Communist government. It is, moreover, the judgment of the State Department that a major goal of the Castro regime is to export its Communist revolution to the rest of Latin America.\n14\n The United States and other members of the Organization of American States have determined that travel between Cuba and the other countries of the Western Hemisphere is an important element in the spreading of subversion and many have therefore \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n undertaken measures to discourage such travel.\n15\n It also cannot be forgotten that in the early days of the Castro regime, United States citizens were arrested and imprisoned without charges. We think, particularly in view of the President's statutory obligation to \"use such means, not amounting to acts of war, as he may think necessary and proper\" to secure the release of an American citizen unjustly deprived of his liberty by a foreign government,\n16\n that the Secretary has justifiably concluded that travel to Cuba by American citizens might involve the Nation in dangerous international incidents, and that the Constitution does not require him to validate passports for such travel.\n\nThe right to travel within the United States is of course also constitutionally protected, cf. Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160\n. But that freedom does not mean that areas ravaged by flood, fire or pestilence cannot be quarantined when it can be demonstrated that unlimited travel to the area would directly and materially interfere with \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n the safety and welfare of the area or the Nation as a whole. So it is with international travel. That the restriction which is challenged in this case is supported by the weightiest considerations of national security is perhaps best pointed up by recalling that the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 preceded the filing of appellant's complaint by less than two months.\n\nAppellant also asserts that the Secretary's refusal to validate his passport for travel to Cuba denies him rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. His claim is different from that which was raised in Kent v. Dulles, supra, and Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra, for the refusal to validate appellant's passport does not result from any expression or association on his part; appellant is not being forced to choose between membership in an organization and freedom to travel. Appellant's allegation is, rather, that the \"travel ban is a direct interference with the First Amendment rights of citizens to travel abroad so that they might acquaint themselves at first hand with the effects abroad of our Government's policies, foreign and domestic, and with conditions abroad which might affect such policies.\" We must agree that the Secretary's refusal to validate passports for Cuba renders less than wholly free the flow of information concerning that country. While we further agree that this is a factor to be considered in determining whether appellant has been denied due process of law,\n17\n we cannot accept the contention of appellant that it is a First Amendment right which is involved. For to the extent that the Secretary's refusal to validate passports for Cuba acts as an inhibition (and it would be unrealistic to assume that it does not), it is an inhibition of action. There are few restrictions \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n on action which could not be clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data flow. For example, the prohibition of unauthorized entry into the White House diminishes the citizen's opportunities to gather information he might find relevant to his opinion of the way the country is being run, but that does not make entry into the White House a First Amendment right. The right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information.\n\nFinally, appellant challenges the 1926 Act on the ground that it does not contain sufficiently definite standards for the formulation of travel controls by the Executive. It is important to bear in mind, in appraising this argument, that because of the changeable and explosive nature of contemporary international relations, and the fact that the Executive is immediately privy to information which cannot be swiftly presented to, evaluated by, and acted upon by the legislature, Congress - in giving the Executive authority over matters of foreign affairs - must of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it customarily wields in domestic areas.\n\n  \"Practically every volume of the United States  Statutes contains one or more acts or joint resolutions  of Congress authorizing action by the President  in respect of subjects affecting foreign relations, which  either leave the exercise of the power to his unrestricted  judgment, or provide a standard far more  general than that which has always been considered  requisite with regard to domestic affairs.\" United  States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304, 324\n.\n\n\n This does not mean that simply because a statute deals with foreign relations, it can grant the Executive totally unrestricted freedom of choice. However, the 1926 Act contains no such grant. We have held, Kent v. Dulles, supra, and reaffirm today, that the 1926 Act must take its \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n content from history: it authorizes only those passport refusals and restrictions \"which it could fairly be argued were adopted by Congress in light of prior administrative practice.\" Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 128. So limited, the Act does not constitute an invalid delegation.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nAppellant's complaint sought not only an order compelling the Secretary of State to validate his passport for travel to Cuba, but also a declaration that appellant \"is entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to travel to Cuba,\" and an order enjoining the Secretary and the Attorney General from interfering with such travel. Read in the context of the arguments appellant makes here, it appears that the intent of the complaint was that these latter prayers should be considered only in the event that the court decided that the Secretary lacks authority to refuse to validate appellant's passport for Cuba. However, the complaint can also be read to incorporate a request that, even if the court should find that the Secretary does have such authority, it go on to decide whether appellant can be criminally prosecuted, under 215 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 190, 8 U.S.C. 1185 (b) (1958 ed.), for travel in violation of an area restriction. That section provides:\n\n \"After such proclamation as is provided for in subsection (a) has been made and published and while such proclamation is in force, it shall, except as otherwise provided by the President, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may authorize and prescribe, be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter the United States unless he bears a valid passport.\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n A proclamation of the sort referred to was issued in 1953 and remains on the books. Pres. Proc. No. 3004, 67 Stat. c31; cf. Exec. Order No. 11037, 3 CFR 621 (1959-1963 Comp.). We hold that on either interpretation of the complaint, the court below was correct in refusing to reach the issue of criminal liability.\n\nThere are circumstances under which courts properly make exceptions to the general rule that equity will not interfere with the criminal processes, by entertaining actions for injunction or declaratory relief in advance of criminal prosecution. See Evers v. Dwyer, \n358 \nU.S. 202\n; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n. However, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201 (1958 ed.), \"is an enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.\" Public Serv. Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., \n344 \nU.S. 237, 241\n. The complaint filed in this case does not specify the sort of travel to Cuba appellant has in mind - e. g., whether he plans to proceed to Cuba directly or travel there via one or more other countries. Nor can we tell from the papers filed whether the Government will, in the event appellant journeys to Cuba, charge him under 215 (b) with leaving the United States on a carrier bound for Cuba with a passport not validated for Cuba; leaving the United States with such a passport with the intent of traveling to Cuba before he returns home; leaving the United States with such a passport on a journey which in fact takes him to Cuba; re-entering the United States with such a passport after having visited Cuba; some other act - or whether it will charge him at all.\n18\n Whether \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n each or any of these gradations of fact or charge would make a difference as to criminal liability is an issue on which the District Court wisely took no position. Nor do we. For if we are to avoid rendering a series of advisory opinions, adjudication of the reach and constitutionality of 215 (b) must await a concrete fact situation. Compare Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450\n.\n\nThe District Court therefore correctly dismissed the complaint, and its judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This procedural claim was abandoned in the District Court and has not been urged here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, \n362 \nU.S. 73, 80\n; see also Allen v. Grand Central Aircraft Co., \n347 \nU.S. 535\n: Lee v. Bickell. \n292 \nU.S. 415\n; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See also Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The convening of a three-judge court in this case surely coincides with the legislative policy underlying the passage of 2282:\n\n\"The legislative history of 2282 and of its complement, 2281 . . . indicates that these sections were enacted to prevent a single federal judge from being able to paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme, either state or federal, by issuance of a broad injunctive order. . . . Repeatedly emphasized during the congressional debates on 2282 were the heavy pecuniary costs of the unforeseen and debilitating interruptions in the administration of federal law which could be wrought by a single judge's order, and the great burdens entailed in coping with harassing actions brought one after another to challenge the operation of an entire statutory scheme, wherever jurisdiction over government officials could be acquired, until a judge was ultimately found who would grant the desired injunction.\" Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, \n372 \nU.S. 144, 154\n-155. Appellant in this case does not challenge merely a \"single, unique exercise\" of the Secretary's authority, cf. Phillips v. United States, supra, at 253. On the contrary, this suit seeks to \"paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme,\" indeed, a regulatory scheme designed and administered to promote the security of the Nation.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Secretary of State, rather than the President, imposed the restriction on travel to Cuba. However, Congress has provided that \"[t]he Secretary of State shall perform such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the President relative to . . . such . . . matters respecting foreign affairs as the President of the United States shall assign to the department . . . .\" R. S. 202, 5 U.S.C. 156 (1958 ed.).

JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nArticle I of the Constitution provides that \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\" (Emphasis supplied.)

See Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500, 517\n (concurring opinion); cf. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n. Since Article I, however, vests \"All legislative Powers\" in the Congress, and no language in the Constitution purports to vest any such power in the President, it necessarily follows, if the Constitution is to control, that the President is completely devoid of power to make laws regulating passports or anything else. And he has no more power to make laws by labeling them regulations than to do so by calling them laws. Like my Brother GOLDBERG, I cannot accept the Government's argument that the President has \"inherent\" power to make regulations governing the issuance and use of passports. Post, pp. 28-30. We emphatically and I think properly rejected a similar argument advanced to support a seizure of the Nation's steel companies \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n by the President. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 579\n. And regulation of passports. just like regulation of steel companies, is a law-making - not an executive, law-enforcing - function.\n\nNor can I accept the Government's contention that the passport regulations here involved are valid \"because the Passport Act of 1926 in unequivocal words delegates to the President and Secretary a general discretionary power over passports . . . .\" That Act does provide that \"the Secretary of State may grant and issue passports, and cause passports to be granted, issued, and verified in foreign countries . . . under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe . . . .\"\n1\n Quite obviously, the Government does not exaggerate in saying that this Act \"does not provide any specific standards for the Secretary\" and \"delegates to the President and Secretary a general discretionary power over passports\" - a power so broad, in fact, as to be marked by no bounds except an unlimited discretion. It is plain therefore that Congress has not itself passed a law regulating passports; it has merely referred the matter to the Secretary of State and the President in words that say in effect. \"We delegate to you our constitutional power to make such laws regulating passports as you see fit.\" The Secretary of State has proceeded to exercise the power to make such laws regulating the issuance of passports by declaring that he will issue them for Cuba only to \"persons whose travel may be regarded as being in the best interests of the United States,\" as he views those interests. For Congress to attempt to delegate such an undefined law-making power to the Secretary, the President, or both, makes applicable to this 1926 Act what Mr. Justice Cardozo said about the National Industrial Recovery Act:\n2\n \"This is delegation running riot. No such plenitude of power is susceptible of transfer.\" \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 553\n (concurring opinion). See also Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n; cf. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116, 129\n.\n\nOur Constitution has ordained that laws restricting the liberty of our people can be enacted by the Congress and by the Congress only. I do not think our Constitution intended that this vital legislative function could be farmed out in large blocks to any governmental official. whoever he might be, or to any governmental department or bureau, whatever administrative expertise it might be thought to have. The Congress was created on the assumption that enactment of this free country's laws could be safely entrusted to the representatives of the people in Congress, and to no other official or government agency. The people who are called on to obey laws have a constitutional right to have them passed only in this constitutional way. This right becomes all the more essential when as here the person called on to obey may be punishable by five years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine if he dares to travel without the consent of the Secretary or one of his subordinates.\n3\n It is irksome enough for one who wishes to travel to be told by the Congress, the constitutional lawmaker with power to legislate in this field, that he cannot go where he wishes. It is bound to be far more irritating - and I do not think the authors of our Constitution, who gave \"All\" legislative power to Congress, intended - for a citizen of this country to be told that he cannot get a passport because Congress has given an unlimited discretion to an executive official (or viewed practically, to his subordinates) to decide when and where he may go. I repeat my belief that Congress has ample power to regulate foreign travel. And of course, the fact that there may be good and adequate reasons for Congress \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n to pass such a law is no argument whatever for holding valid a law written not by the Congress but by executive officials. See Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, supra, 293 U.S. at 420. I think the 1926 Act gives the lawmaking power of Congress to the Secretary and the President and that it therefore violates the constitutional command that \"All\" legislative power be vested in the Congress. I would therefore reverse the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. 211a (1958 ed.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 195.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 66 Stat. 190, 8 U.S.C. 1185 (1964 ed.).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG concurs, dissenting.\n\nAppellant, the holder of a valid United States passport, requested that his passport be validated for travel to Cuba: he wished to make the trip \"to satisfy my curiosity about the state of affairs in Cuba and to make me a better informed citizen.\" The need for validation arose from the Department of State's prior elimination of Cuba from the area for which passports were not required. 22 CFR 53.3 (b), and from its issuance of a public notice declaring all outstanding passports invalid for travel to Cuba unless specifically endorsed for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State, 26 Fed. Reg. 492. A companion press release of January 16, 1961, stated that such travel would be permitted by \"persons whose travel may be regarded as being in the best interests of the United States, such as newsmen or businessmen with previously established business interests.\" The Passport Office denied appellant's request for validation. Referring to the press release, the Deputy Director of the Passport Office informed appellant that it was \"obvious that your present purpose of visiting Cuba does not meet the standards for validation of your passport.\"\n\nWe held in Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n, that the right to travel overseas, as well as at home, was part of the citizen's liberty under the Fifth Amendment. That conclusion was not an esoteric one drawn from the blue. It \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n reflected a judgment as to the peripheral rights of the citizen under the First Amendment. The right to know, to converse with others, to consult with them, to observe social, physical, political and other phenomena abroad as well as at home gives meaning and substance to freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Without those contacts First Amendment rights suffer. That is why in Kent v. Dulles, supra, we said that freedom of movement has \"large social values.\" Id., at 126.\n\nThe ability to understand this pluralistic world, filled with clashing ideologies, is a prerequisite of citizenship if we and the other peoples of the world are to avoid the nuclear holocaust. The late Pope John XXIII in his famous encyclical Pacem in Terris stated the idea eloquently:\n\n \"Men are becoming more and more convinced that disputes which arise between States should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation.\n\n\n \"It is true that on historical grounds this conviction is based chiefly on the terrible destructive force of modern arms; and it is nourished by the horror aroused in the mind by the very thought of the cruel destruction and the immense suffering which the use of those armaments would bring to the human family; and for this reason it is hardly possible to imagine that in the atomic era war could be used as an instrument of justice.\n\n\n \"Nevertheless, unfortunately, the law of fear still reigns among peoples, and it forces them to spend fabulous sums for armaments: not for aggression, they affirm - and there is no reason for not believing them - but to dissuade others from aggression.\n\n\n \"There is reason to hope, however, that by meeting and negotiating, men may come to discover better the bonds that unite them together, deriving from \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n the human nature which they have in common; and that they may also come to discover that one of the most profound requirements of their common nature is this: that between them and their respective peoples it is not fear which should reign but love, a love which tends to express itself in a collaboration that is loyal manifold in form and productive of many benefits.\"\n\n\n He also said:\n\n \"From the fact that human beings are by nature social, there arises the right of assembly and association.\"\n\n\n Since we deal with rights peripheral to the enjoyment of First Amendment guarantees, restrictive legislation must be \"narrowly drawn\" (Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 307\n) to meet a precise evil. Only last Term, in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500\n, we reaffirmed that when we struck down a provision of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 987) because it \"too broadly and indiscriminately\" restricted the right to travel. Id., at 505. We should do the same here.\n\nI agree that there are areas to which Congress can restrict or ban travel. Pestilences may rage in a region making it necessary to protect not only the traveler but those he might infect on his return. A theatre of war may be too dangerous for travel. Other like situations can be put. But the only so-called danger present here is the Communist regime in Cuba. The world, however, is filled with Communist thought; and Communist regimes are on more than one continent. They are part of the world spectrum; and if we are to know them and understand them, we must mingle with them, as Pope John said. Keeping alive intellectual intercourse between opposing groups has always been important and perhaps was never more important than now. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe First Amendment presupposes a mature people. not afraid of ideas. The First Amendment leaves no room for the official, whether truculent or benign, to say nay or yea because the ideas offend or please him or because he believes some political objective is served by keeping the citizen at home or letting him go. Yet that is just what the Court's decision today allows to happen. We have here no congressional determination that Cuba is an area from which our national security demands that Americans be excluded. Nor do we have a congressional authorization of the Executive to make such a determination according to standards fixed by Congress. Rather we have only the claim that Congress has painted with such a \"broad brush\" that the State Department can ban travel to Cuba simply because it is pleased to do so. By permitting this, the Court ignores the \"familiar and basic principle.\" Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra, at 508, that \"a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms.\" NAACP v. Alabama, \n377 \nU.S. 288, 307\n.\n\nAs I have said, the right to travel is at the periphery of the First Amendment, rather than at its core, largely because travel is, of course, more than speech: it is speech brigaded with conduct. \"Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society. . . . [But i]n every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom.\" Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, at 304. Restrictions on the right to travel in times of peace should be so particularized that a First Amendment right is not precluded unless some clear countervailing national interest stands in the way of its assertion.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Time after time this Court has been alert to protect First Amendment rights which are exercised in a context of overt action which \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n is subject to governmental regulation. \"In a series of decisions this Court has held that, even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved. The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.\" Shelton v. Tucker, \n364 \nU.S. 479, 488\n. See, e. g., Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n; Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra; Martin v. Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141\n; Saia v. New York, \n334 \nU.S. 558\n; Kunz v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 290\n; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232, 239\n; Louisiana ex rel. Gremillion v. NAACP, \n366 \nU.S. 293\n; NAACP v. Button, \n371 \nU.S. 415\n; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting.\n\nLast year approximately 2,750,000 Americans traveled abroad. More than 1,100,000 passports were issued or renewed, nearly 4,000 of which were obtained by journalists.\n1\n This phenomenal amount of travel not only demonstrates our curiosity about things foreign, and the increasing importance of, and indeed often necessity for, travel, but it also reflects the long history of freedom of movement which Americans have enjoyed. Since the founding of the Republic our Government has encouraged such travel.\n2\n For example, in 1820, when John Quincy Adams issued a passport to one Luther Bradish he certified that Bradish was about to visit foreign countries \"with the view of gratifying a commendable curiosity.\"\n3\n In 1962, however, when appellant requested that his passport be validated so that he might travel to Cuba \"to satisfy my curiosity about the state of affairs in Cuba and to make me a better informed citizen,\" his request was \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n denied upon the basis of Department of State regulations. issued under the alleged authority of an Executive Order, restricting travel to Cuba.\n\nAppellant attacks the limitation imposed upon the validity of his passport as beyond the inherent power of the Executive, unauthorized by Congress, and beyond the constitutional authority of either the Executive or Congress. I agree with the Court that Congress has the constitutional power to impose area restrictions on travel. consistent with constitutional guarantees, and I reject appellant's arguments to the contrary. With all deference, however, I do not agree with the Court's holding that Congress has exercised this power. Moreover, I do not believe that the Executive has inherent authority to impose area restrictions in time of peace. I would hold, under the principles established by prior decisions of this Court that inasmuch as Congress has not authorized the Secretary to impose area restrictions, appellant was entitled to a passport valid for travel to Cuba.\n\n I. INHERENT AUTHORITY OF THE EXECUTIVE.\n\n\n This Court has recognized that the right to travel abroad is \"an important aspect of the citizen's `liberty'\" guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116, 127\n. In Aptheker v. Secretary of State, \n378 \nU.S. 500, 517\n, we reaffirmed that \"freedom of travel is a constitutional liberty closely related to rights of free speech and association.\" As nations have become politically and commercially more dependent upon one another and foreign policy decisions have come to have greater impact upon the lives of our citizens, the right to travel has become correspondingly more important. Through travel, by private citizens as well as by journalists and governmental officials, information necessary to the making of informed decisions can be obtained. And, under our constitutional system, \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n ultimate responsibility for the making of informed decisions rests in the hands of the people. As Professor Chafee has pointed out, \"An American who has crossed the ocean is not obliged to form his opinions about our foreign policy merely from what he is told by officials of our government or by a few correspondents of American newspapers. Moreover, his views on domestic questions are enriched by seeing how foreigners are trying to solve similar problems. In many different ways direct contact with other countries contributes to sounder decisions at home.\" Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, 195-196 (1956).\n\nThe constitutional basis of the right to travel and its importance to decision-making in our democratic society led this Court in Kent v. Dulles, supra, to conclude that \"[i]f that `liberty' is to be regulated, it must be pursuant to the law-making functions of the Congress.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 129\n. Implicit in this statement, and at the very core of the holding in Kent v. Dulles, is a rejection of the argument there advanced and also made here by the Government that the Executive possesses an inherent power to prohibit or impede travel by restricting the issuance of passports. The Court in Kent expressly recognized that a passport is not only of great value, but also is necessary\n4\n to leave this country and to travel to most parts of the world. Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 121. The Court demonstrates in Kent v. Dulles, and I shall show in detail below, that there is no long-standing and consistent history of the \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n exercise of an alleged inherent Executive power to limit travel or restrict the validity of passports. In view of the constitutional basis of the right to travel, the legal and practical necessity for passports, and the absence of a long-standing Executive practice of imposing area restrictions, I would rule here, as this Court did in Kent v. Dulles, that passport restrictions may be imposed only when Congress makes provision therefor \"in explicit terms.\" Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 130, consistent with constitutional guarantees. Cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 579\n. I would hold expressly that the Executive has no inherent authority to impose area restrictions in time of peace.\n\n  II. STATUTORY AUTHORITY\n\n\n I cannot accept the Court's view that authority to impose area restrictions was granted to the Executive by Congress in the Passport Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 887, 22 U.S.C. 211a (1958 ed.), which provides, \"The Secretary of State may grant and issue passports . . . under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States, and no other person shall grant, issue, or verify such passports.\" I do not believe that the legislative history of this provision, or administrative practice prior to its most recent re-enactment in 1926 will support the Court's interpretation of the statute. Moreover, the nature of the problem presented by area restrictions makes it unlikely that authority to impose such restrictions was granted by Congress in the course of enacting such a broad general statute. In my view, as the history I shall relate establishes, this statute was designed solely to centralize authority to issue passports in the hands of the Secretary of State in order to overcome the abuses and chaos caused by the fact that prior to the passage of the statute numerous unauthorized persons issued passports and travel documents. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  A. The Legislative History.\n\n\n The 1926 provision has its origin in the Act of August 18, 1856, 11 Stat. 52, 60-61. Prior to 1856 the issuance of passports was not regulated by law. Governors of States, local mayors, and even notaries public issued documents which served as passports. This produced confusion abroad. In 1835 Secretary of State Forsyth wrote:\n\n \"It is within the knowledge of the Department that the diplomatic agents of foreign governments in the United States have declined authenticating acts of governors or other State or local authorities; and foreign officers abroad usually require that passports granted by such authorities shall be authenticated by the ministers or consuls of the United States. Those functionaries, being thus called upon, find themselves embarrassed between their desire to accommodate their fellow-citizens and their unwillingness to certify what they do not officially know; and the necessity of some uniform practice, which may remove the difficulties on all sides, has been strongly urged upon the Department.\" III Moore, International Law Digest 862-863 (1906).\n\n\n Despite administrative efforts to curb the flow of state and local passports, Secretary of State Marcy wrote in 1854:\n\n \"To preserve proper respect for our passports it will be necessary to guard against frauds as far as possible in procuring them. I regret to say that local magistrates or persons pretending to have authority to issue passports have imposed upon persons who go abroad with these spurious papers. Others, again, who know that they are not entitled to passports - not being citizens of the United States - seek to get these fraudulent passports, thinking that they will protect them while abroad.\" III Moore, op. cit. supra, at 863. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n As is noted in an official history of the State Department. \"The lack of legal provision on the subject [of passports] led to gross abuses, and `the impositions practiced upon the illiterate and unwary by the fabrication of worthless passports' [IX Op. Atty. Gen. 350] led finally to the passage of the Act of August 18, 1856.\" The Department of State of the United States: Its History and Functions 178 (1893). This Act provided that \"the Secretary of State shall be authorized to grant and issue passports. and cause passports to be granted, issued, and verified in foreign countries by such diplomatic or consular officers of the United States, and under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States, and no other person shall grant, issue, or verify any such passport.\" 11 Stat. 60. That Act made it a crime for a person to issue a passport who was not authorized to do so. This provision was re-enacted on July 3, 1926. 44 Stat. 887, in substantially identical form.\n5\n There is no indication in the legislative history either at the time the Act was originally passed in 1856 or when it was re-enacted, that it was meant to serve any purpose other than that of centralizing the authority to issue passports in the hands of the Secretary of State so as to eliminate abuses in their issuance. Thus, in my view, the authority to make rules, granted by the statute to the Executive, extends only to the promulgation of rules designed to carry out this statutory purpose. \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  B. The Administrative Practice.\n\n\n The administrative practice of the State Department prior to 1926 does not support the Court's view that when Congress re-enacted the 1856 provision in 1926 it intended to grant the Executive authority to impose area restrictions. Prior to the First World War the State Department had never limited the validity of passports for travel to any particular area. In fact, limitations upon travel had been imposed only twice. During the War of 1812 Congress specifically provided by statute that persons could not cross enemy lines without a passport. and in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War the Secretary of State ruled that passports would not be issued to persons whose loyalty was in doubt. These restrictions were imposed in time of war. The first, restricting the area of travel, evidently was thought to require a specific statutory enactment by Congress, and the second did not limit the area of travel, but, rather, limited the persons to whom passports would be issued.\n6\n Until 50 years ago peacetime limitations upon the right of a citizen to travel were virtually unknown, see Chafee, op. cit. supra, at 193; Jaffe, The Right to Travel: The Passport Problem. 35 Foreign Affairs 17, and it was in this atmosphere that the Act of 1856 was passed and its re-enactment prior to 1926 took place.\n\nThe only area restrictions imposed between 1856 and 1926 arose out of the First World War. Although Americans \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n were not required by law to carry passports in 1915, certain foreign countries insisted that Americans have them. American Consulates and Embassies abroad were therefore authorized to issue emergency passports after the outbreak of the war, and in 1915 the Secretary of State telegraphed American Ambassadors and Ministers in France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark: \"Do not issue emergency passports for use in Belgium [then occupied by German armed forces] unless applicants obliged to go thither by special exigency or authorized by Red Cross or Belgian Relief Commission.\" See III Hackworth, Digest of International Law 525-526 (1942). After the United States entered World War I travel to areas of belligerency and to enemy countries was restricted. Passports were marked not valid for travel to these areas, and Congress provided by statute that passports were necessary in order to leave or enter the United States. The congressional Act requiring passports for travel expired in 1921, and soon after the official end of the war passports were marked valid for travel to all countries. See III Hackworth, supra, at 527; Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Department of State Passport Policies, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 64 (hereafter Senate Hearings). Thus in 1926 freedom of travel was as complete as prior to World War I. In this atmosphere Congress re-enacted, in virtually identical terms, the 1856 statute, the sole purpose of which, as I have already noted, was to centralize passport issuance. Congress in doing so did not indicate the slightest intent or desire to enlarge the authority of the Executive to regulate the issuance of passports. Surely travel restrictions imposed while the United States was at war and a single telegram instructing ministers to deny emergency passports for a brief time in 1915 for travel to a theatre of war, do not show that Congress, by re-enacting the 1856 Act in 1926, intended to authorize the Executive \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n to impose area restrictions upon travel in peacetime whenever the Executive believed such restrictions might advance American foreign policy. The long tradition of freedom of movement, the fact that no passport area restrictions existed prior to World War I, the complete absence of any indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to delegate such sweeping authority to the Executive all point in precisely the opposite direction.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn Kent v. Dulles, supra, the Court held that the 1926 Act did not authorize the Secretary of State to withhold passports from persons because of their political beliefs or associations. Although it was argued that prior to \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n 1926 the Secretary had withheld passports from Communists and other suspected subversives and that such an administrative practice had been adopted by Congress, the Court found that the evidence of such a practice was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that it had congressional authorization.\n\nYet in Kent v. Dulles the Government pointed to scattered Executive interpretations showing that upon occasion the State Department believed that it had the authority in peacetime to withhold passports from persons deemed by the Department to hold subversive beliefs. In 1901 Attorney General Knox advised the Secretary of State that a passport might be withheld from \"an avowed anarchist.\" 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 509, 511. Orders promulgated by the Passport Office periodically have required denial of passport to \"revolutionary radicals.\" See Passport Office Instructions of May 4, 1921. A State Department memorandum of May 29, 1956, in summarizing the Department's passport policy, states that after the Russian Revolution \"passports were refused to American Communists who desired to go abroad for indoctrination, instruction, etc. This policy was continued until 1931 . . . .\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThese isolated instances of the assumption of authority to refuse passports to persons thought subversive were held insufficient to show that Congress in 1926 intended to grant the Secretary of State discretionary authority to deny passports to persons because of their political beliefs, Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 128. This case presents an even more attenuated showing of administrative practice, for there is revealed only one isolated instance of a peacetime area restriction and this closely connected with World War I. Clearly this single instance is insufficient to show \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n that Congress intended to authorize the Secretary to impose peacetime area restrictions.\n\nMoreover, just as the more numerous instances of restriction on travel because of political beliefs and associations in wartime were insufficient to show that Congress intended to grant the Secretary authority to curtail such travel in time of peace, see Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 128. so here the fact that area restrictions were imposed during World War I does not show that Congress intended to grant the Secretary authority to impose such restrictions in time of peace. In time of war and in the exercise of the war power, restrictions may be imposed that are neither permissible nor tolerable in time of peace. See Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 128; cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 579\n. But see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, \n372 \nU.S. 144\n. Thus even if the State Department's wartime practice should lead to the conclusion that area restrictions in time of war were sanctioned, it surely does not show that Congress wished to authorize similar curtailment of the right to travel in time of peace.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the Court intimates that Kent v. Dulles is distinguishable from the present case because in Kent v. Dulles passports were denied on the basis of the applicants' political beliefs, ante, at 13, I find little in the logic of that opinion to support such a distinction. The Court in Kent v. Dulles based its conclusions that the Executive does not have an inherent power to impose peacetime passport restrictions and that Congress did not delegate such authority to the Executive on the history of \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n passport restrictions and the constitutional basis of the right to travel. While the Court there mentions that it is dealing \"with beliefs, with associations, with ideological matters,\" 357 U.S. at 130, a reading of the opinion clearly reveals that its holding does not turn upon such factors. Moreover, the importance of travel to the gathering of information, an activity closely connected with the First Amendment and a right asserted here, seems to be a major reason for the Court's holding in Aptheker and Kent that the right to travel is afforded constitutional protection. Kent v. Dulles thus seems not only relevant, but controlling, in the case presented here.\n\n C. The Statute's Inapplicability to the Problem    of Area Restrictions.\n\n\n The Court's interpretation of the 1926 Passport Act not only overlooks the legislative history of the Act and departs from the letter and spirit of this Court's decisions in Kent v. Dulles, supra, and Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra, but it also implies that Congress resolved. through a sweeping grant of authority, the many substantial problems involved in curtailing a citizen's right to travel because of considerations of national policy. People travel abroad for numerous reasons of varying importance. Some travel for pleasure, others for business, still others for education. Foreign correspondents and lecturers must equip themselves with firsthand information. Scientists and scholars gain considerably from interchanges with colleagues in other nations. See Chafee, op. cit. supra, at 195.\n\nJust as there are different reasons for people wanting to travel, so there are different reasons advanced by the Government for its need to impose area restrictions. These reasons vary. The Government says restrictions are imposed sometimes because of political differences with countries, sometimes because of unsettled conditions. and sometimes, as in this case, as part of a program, undertaken \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n together with other nations, to isolate a hostile foreign country such as Cuba because of its attempts to promote the subversion of democratic nations. See Senate Hearings 63-69. The Department of State also has imposed different types of travel restrictions in different circumstances. All newsmen, for example, were prohibited from traveling to China, see Senate Hearings 67, but they have been allowed to visit Cuba. See Public Notice 179 (Jan. 16, 1961), 26 Fed. Reg. 492; Press Release No. 24, issued by the Secretary of State, Jan. 16, 1961. In view of the different types of need for travel restrictions, the various reasons for traveling abroad, the importance and constitutional underpinnings of the right to travel and the right of a citizen and a free press to gather information about foreign countries, it cannot be presumed that Congress, without focusing upon the complex problems involved, resolved them by adopting a broad and sweeping statute which, in the Court's view, confers unlimited discretion upon the Executive, and which makes no distinctions reconciling the rights of the citizen to travel with the Government's legitimate needs. I do not know how Congress would deal with this complex area were it to focus on the problems involved, or whether, for example, in light of our commitment to freedom of the press, Congress would consent under any circumstances to prohibiting newsmen from traveling to foreign countries. But, faced with a complete absence of legislative consideration of these complex issues, I would not presume that Congress, in 1926, issued a blanket authorization to the Executive to impose area restrictions and define their scope and duration, for the nature of the problem seems plainly to call for a more discriminately fashioned statute.\n\n    III. CONCLUSION.\n\n\n In my view it is clear that Congress did not mean the 1926 Act to authorize the Executive to impose area restrictions \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n in time of peace, and, with all deference, I disagree with the Court's holding that it did. I agree with the Court that Congress may authorize the imposition of travel restrictions consistent with constitutional guarantees, but I find it plain and evident that Congress has never considered and resolved the problem. After consideration Congress might determine that broad general authority should be delegated to the Secretary of State, or it might frame a narrower statute. I believe that here, as in other areas, appropriate delegation is constitutionally permissible where some standard for the application of delegated power is provided. See, e. g., Lichter v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 742, 785\n. However, in light of my conclusion that the 1926 Act did not deal with area restrictions I do not find it necessary to consider the question of whether the language of the 1926 Act might constitute an unconstitutionally broad delegation of power.\n\nIn view of the different types of need for area restrictions asserted by the Government, the various reasons for travel abroad, the importance and constitutional underpinnings of the right of citizens and a free press to gather information about foreign countries - considerations which Congress did not focus upon - I would not infer, as the Court does, that Congress resolved the complex problem of area restrictions, which necessarily involves reconciling the rights of the citizen to travel with the Government's legitimate needs, by the re-enactment of a statute that history shows was designed to centralize authority to issue passports in the Secretary of State so as to prevent abuses arising from their issuance by unauthorized persons. Since I conclude that the Executive does not possess inherent power to impose area restrictions in peacetime, and that Congress has not considered the issue and granted such authority to the Executive. I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Dept. of State, Summary of Passport Statistics Jan. 1965.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Very recently the President has requested citizens voluntarily and temporarily to limit their travel abroad because of balance of payments difficulties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See U.S. Dept. of State, The American Passport 10 (1898).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Except for the years 1918 to 1921 and since 1941 American law did not require a passport for travel abroad. Currently, however, 215 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 190, 8 U.S.C. 1185 (b) (1958 ed.), makes it unlawful, after the proclamation of a national emergency \"to depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States . . . [without] a valid passport.\" The Court expresses no views nor do I upon the validity or proper interpretation of this provision, which is currently involved in other litigation not now before us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The following changes have been made in the wording of this provision of the statute between 1856 and the present: When the statute was placed in the Revised Statutes of 1874, the words \"shall be authorized to\" were replaced by \"may.\" R. S. 4075. On June 14, 1902, the provision was amended to increase the list of those whom the Secretary could cause to grant, issue and verify passports in foreign countries by adding the words \"and by such chief or other executive officer of the insular possessions of the United States.\" 32 Stat. 386. When the provision was re-enacted in 1926, the list of those whom the Secretary could cause to grant, issue and verify passports \n\n[381 \nU.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n in foreign countries was modified by substituting for the words \"by such diplomatic or consular officers of the United States,\" the words \"by diplomatic representatives of the United States, and by such consul generals, consuls, or vice consuls when in charge, as the Secretary of State may designate,\" and the words \"such passports\" were substituted for the words \"any such passport.\" 44 Stat. 887.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Kent v. Dulles, supra, at 128, where the Court implies that regulation of travel based upon disloyalty to the country during wartime presents quite a different question from such regulation in time of peace.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Court also argues that State Department imposition of area restrictions after 1926 shows that the Act granted power to impose such restrictions, for a consistent administrative interpretation must be given weight by the courts. Ante, at 11. See Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294\n. With all deference, I do not find a consistent administrative interpretation of the 1926 Act. While area restrictions have been imposed by the Executive from time to time since 1926, see Senate Hearings 64-65, the Executive has also indicated doubts as to its authority to restrict passports. In 1958 the President formally asked Congress for \"clear statutory authority to prevent Americans from using passports for travel to areas where there is no means of protecting them, or where their presence would conflict with our foreign policy objectives.\" H. R. Doc. No. 417, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. In 1957 the Report of the Commission on Government Security expressly recommended that it be made unlawful \"for any citizen of the United States to travel to any country in which his passport is declared to be invalid.\" S. Doc. No. 64, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 475. Moreover, when the Department of State announced limitations on the use of passports for travel to Red China, the accompanying press release stated that the restrictions did not forbid American travel to the areas restricted. See Senate Hearings 40; Report of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Freedom to Travel 70 (1958). In any event I believe that the evidence set out above that Congress did not mean the 1926 Act to authorize the imposition of area restrictions is sufficiently strong so that it is not overcome by the fact that after 1926 the Department on occasion asserted that it had an inherent power to impose such restrictions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See the Report of the Commission on Government Security 470, 471 (1957).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Although the United States has severed its diplomatic ties with the Castro government, and, as the Court correctly points out, ante, at 14-15, justifiably regards the Castro regime as hostile to this country, the United States is not in a state of war with Cuba.
