States Supreme Court\nALBERTO v. NICOLAS(1929)\nNo. 364\nArgued: March 6, 1929Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry J. Richardson, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to bring here for review an order of ouster in quo warranto brought by Bonifacio Nicolas against Severino Alberto to test the right of Alberto to hold the office of justice of peace of the town of Angat, province of Bulacan, in those Islands. The issue is the legal right \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n of the Governor-General to transfer a justice of the peace from one municipality to another without the consent of the Philippine Senate.\n After issue made, the parties, through their counsel, signed a stipulation of facts, from which it appears that on February 9, 1920, the plaintiff was appointed a justice of the peace of Angat, Bulacan, by the Governor-General with the advice and consent of the Philippine Senate; that he qualified, took possession of, and exercised, the office on and since February 14, 1920, up to August 19, 1927, when he was forced to surrender its possession to the defendant. On February 28, 1918, the defendant was appointed justice of the peace of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, by the Governor-General, with the advice and consent of the Senate; he qualified for and exercised the office since then up to August 19, 1927, when, pursuant to an order tranferring him to the office of justice of the peace of Angat, Bulacan, he exercised, and has since exercised, the latter office. There was a proceeding by the municipal president of Angat against the plaintiff, which was investigated by the judge of first instance of Bulacan, resulting in a report which disclosed unsatisfactory conditions and political partisanship but with which the president of Angat was not content because the plaintiff was not removed. The matter was appealed to the Secretary of Justice. Thereafter, on July 2, 1927, the Governor-General transferred the plaintiff from Angat to San Jose del Monte, and also transferred the defendant to the municipality of Angat. There were protests by plaintiff against the transfer and applications by him for reconsideration; and finally through proceedings before the court of first instance of Bulacan the plaintiff yielded up his office under protest on August 19, 1927, and since that time the defendant has exercised the office of justice of the peace of Angat, excluding the plaintiff therefrom. \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court, after the hearing, rendered an opinion by a vote of six judges to three, granting against Alberto a judgment of ouster, to which an application for certiorari to this court has been duly made and granted (October 29, 1928).\n Our jurisdiction in this case is questioned. The act of February 13, 1925,  7, c. 229, 43 Stat. 940 (28 USCA  349), provides that a certiorari may be issued by this court to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in any case 'wherein the Constitution or any statute or treaty of the United States is involved.' The effect of the Philippine Organic Act of Congress, approved August 29, 1916, by section 21, c. 416; 39 Stat. 545, 552 (48 USCA  1111), is that an appointment of a justice of the peace by the Governor-General must be consented to by the Senate of the Islands. Section 206 of the Philippine Administrative Code of 1917, as amended by Act 2768, approved March 5, 1918, enacts a proviso that, 'in case the public interest requires it, a justice of the peace of one municipality may be transferred to another.' The point in question is whether that proviso is to be construed as impliedly requiring the consent of the Philippine Senate to the transfer, or whether it was intended to avoid that necessity.\n In reaching the conclusion that the proviso of section 206 as properly construed required the consent of the Senate, the Supreme preme Court used these words:\n'The body of the section sanctions the holding of office by justices of the peace during good behavior. The proviso qualifies this by providing 'that in case the public interest requires it, a justice of the peace of one municipality may be transferred to another.' At once it is noted that the law is silent as to the office or entity which may make the transfer. The law does not say may be transferred 'by the Governor-General.' The insertion of the words 'by the Philippine Senate' would be as justifiable. \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n The more reasonable inference-indeed, the only possible legal inference permissible without violating the Constitution-is that the justice of the peace may be transferred by the exercise of the appointing power, and the appointing power consists of the Governor- General acting in conjunction with the Philippine Senate.'\n\n In other words, the interpretation that the court gives to the amended law, with the proviso, depends clearly on what the court calls the Constitution, that is, on the Organic Act, and therefore, even if its construction of the proviso of section 206 could be sustained, it still involved the Organic Act. We have jurisdiction.\n In order to understand the scope of this case, we should point out that the Organic Act provides, by sections 6, 7, 8, and 12, that the laws then in force in the Philippines were to remain in effect, except as altered by the act itself, until altered, amended or repealed by the legislative authority provided, in the act, or by an act of Congress; that the legislative authority therein provided, had power. When not inconsistent with the act, to amend, alter, modify or repeal any law, civil or criminal, continued in force by the act as it might see fit; and that the general legislative powers in the Philippines, except as otherwise provided in the act, were vested in the Philippine Legislature, consisting of an Assembly and a Senate.\n Section 21 provided that the Governor-General of the Philippines should be the supreme executive power in the Philippines, and that he should, unless otherwise provided in the act, appoint, by and with the consent of the Senate, such officers as might then be appointed by the Covernor-General, or such as he was authorized by the act to appoint, or whom he might thereafter be authorized by law to appoint; that he should have general supervision and control of all the departments and bureaus of the government in the Philippine Islands as far as \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 144]\n\u00a0\n not inconsistent with the provisions of the act, and that he should be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of the Philippine Islands and of the United States operative within those Islands; that all executive functions of the government must be directly under the Governor- General, or within one of the executive departments under the supervision and control of the Governor-General. Springer v. Philippine Islands, \n277 \nU.S. 189\n, 48 S. Ct. 480.\n After the passage of the Organic Act of 1916, it became necessary to revise the Administrative Code, so as to make it conform to the Organic Act, and it is that Code of 1917, with such amendments as have been made by the Legislative, that is now the existing law.\n In the Administrative Code of 1916, Act No. 2657, approved February 24, 1916, effective July 1, 1916, provision was made for the appointment and distribution of the justices of the peace as follows:\n'Sec. 235. Appointment and distribution of justices of the peace.-One justice of the peace and one auxiliary justice of the peace shall be appointed by the Governor General for the city of Manila, and city of Baguio, and for each municipality, township, and municipal district in the Philippine Islands.'\n\n'Sec 238. Tenure of office.-A justice of the peace having the requisite legal qualifications shall hold office during good behavior unless his office be lawfully abolished or merged in the jurisdiction of some other justice.'\n\n Except for the elimination of the provision for justices of the peace in Manila, these sections were re-enacted without change in sections 203 and 206 of the Revised Code of 1917, which also required the consent of the Philippine Senate to the appointment of officers. Section 206 of the 1917 Code was amended by Act No. 2768, approved March 5, 1918, which added to it the proviso now in question in this suit, and its title was also correspondingly changed, so that the section now reads:\n\n\n[279 U.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 206. Tenure of office-Transfer from one municipality to another.- A justice of the peace having the requisite legal qualifications shall hold office during good behavior unless his office be lawfully abolished or merged in the jurisdiction of some other justice: Provided, that in case the public interest requires it, a justice of the peace of one municipality may be transferred to another.'\n Other pertinent provisions of the Revised Code, in force when respondent Nicolas was appointed a justice of the peace, and still in force, are:\n Section 220 and 221 provide for salaries of justices of the peace in municipalities of the first class, second class, third class and fourth class, in other places not now specially provided for by law, and in provincial capitals.\n Section 222 provides for payment of the salaries of justices of the peace out of insular funds.\n Section 228 provides that the judges of the courts of first instance shall at all times exercise a supervision over the justices of the peace within their respective districts, and shall keep themselves informed of the manner in which these justices perform their duties, and during the first five days of the fiscal year the justices shall forward to the judges of their respective districts a report concerning the business done in their courts for the pervious year.\n Section 229 provides that if at any time the judge of first instance has reason to believe that a justice of the peace is not performing his duties properly, or if complaints are made which, if true, would indicate that the justice in unfit for office, he shall make such investigation of the same as the circumstances may seem to him to warrant, and may, for good cause, repriman the justice, or may recommend to the Governor-General his removal from office, or his removal and disqualification from holding office and may suspend him from office pending action by the Governor- General. The Governor-General \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n may, upon such recommendation or on his own motion, remove from office any justice of the peace or auxiliary justice of the peace.\n Section 203, the first half of which has already been quoted, further provides:\n'Upon the recommendation of the department head, the territorial jurisdiction of any justice and auxiliary justice of the peace may be made to extend over any number of municipalities, townships, municipal districts, or other minor political divisions or places not included in the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace already appointed; and upon like recommendation of the department head, the Governor-General may combine the offices of justices of the peace for two or more such jurisdictions already established, and may appoint to the combined jurisdiction one justice of the peace and one auxiliary justice, at a salary not to exceed severty-five per centum of the sum of the salaries of the combined positions.'\n\n And, following this, section 204 provides:\n'When a new political division affecting the territorial jurisdiction of a justice of the peace is formed or the boundaries limiting the same are changed, the Governor-General, may, in the absence of special provision, designate which of the justices and auxiliary justices within the territory affected by the change shall continue in office; and the powers of any other therein shall cease.'\n\n It is to be observed that the Legislature of the Philippines made legislative provision for as close observation of the conduct of justices of the peace as is practicable. They are not like justices of the peace in this country, generally elected by the people. They are selected by the Governor-General, and occupy positions of considerable power in these local communities, and exercise a control in the remote districts that makes it of the highest importance that they should be closely under the discipline of the chief executive. They are judicial officers, it is true, but these \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 147]\n\u00a0\n provisions indicate how marked a difference there is and must be between the justices of the peace under our system and that of the Philippines. With respect to this matter we may take judicial notice that, while the justices of the peace are to be treated as an important force for the preservation of local order and the administration of police court justice, they are subject to restraint by the Governor-General to prevent the abuses of their offices by the ease with which such local official authority lends itself in the Islands to the creation of caciques or local bosses exercising oppressive control over ignorant neighborhoods. This is the reason why their conduct is not only to be closely inquired into by the courts of first instance, but also why the Governor-General is given absolute power of removal or suspension and the enlargement or restriction of their districts by merging them, and now, in this last amendment, by rearranging their jurisdictions by transfer in the public interest.\n The objection now is made that while, through the Governor-General, the districts under existing justices of the peace may be merged, combined, increased, or decreased, an existing justice of the peace may not be transferred from one district to another, unless there is a new appointment of a justice with a new consent by the Senate.\n This brings us to a consideration of the proper construction of the proviso of section 206 here in question. This proviso was the result of an amendment by section 1 of Act No. 2768 in February, 1918. The original bill was Senate Bill No. 163, providing that section 206 of the Administrative Code be amended by adding the proviso 'that a justice of the peace of one municipality may be transferred to another when the government deems it wise.' An amendment was offered in the Philippine Senate, adding thereto the words: 'Provided further that his appointment by virtue of the transfer be confirmed by the Senate.' With this amend \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 148]\n\u00a0\n ment the bill passed the Senate. When the bill come to the House, the House committee recommended that the amendment made in the Senate be dropped. It so passed the House and was then on February 8, 1918, submitted to the Senate, and the amendment of the House was accepted. A purpose on the part of the Legislature to eliminate from such a transfer the consent of the Senate could hardly be more clearly established.\n The majority of the Supreme Court seems to think otherwise. It is sufficient to say that its suggested implication that the consent of the Senate was to be retained, although express provision for it was expressly stricken out, is not convincing. Nor is the significance attached by the majority of the Supreme Court to the silence of the proviso as to the person intended to make the transfer at all impressive. Nor will the suggestion that the Philippine Senate alone might be intended to make the transfer suffice. The history of the legislation as well as the general trend of it with reference to the powers of the Governor-General in the discipline of justices of the peace, their suspension, their removal, the current extension of their jurisdiction by him pending their incumbency, all are convincing that, however invalid the exclusion of the Sentate from the consent to the transfer, the purpose of the Legislature was certainly intended to effect that very result.\n This brings us, therefore, to the final issue-whether the consent was necessary to the transfer, even though the Senate and the House, acting together as the Legislature, eleminate it by the proviso. It is to be borne in mind that we are dealing with the Philippine Legislature, which has full power to make legislative provision for the appointment of justices of the peace, to provide for their duties, for the payment of their salaries, for their removal, their suspension, their jurisdiction and the changes in their jurisdiction, and to vest in the Governor-General, \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 149]\n\u00a0\n as the executive, the exercise of the powers it thus creates or indeed to abolish justices of the peace and substitute some other system. To take a possible example: Suppose that the Philippine Legislature had created the office of justice of the peace, had provided that the Governor-General should appoint forty justices of the peace for certain described districts in the Philippines, and had directed that the Governor-General should designate for them their districts, but that he might change the designation originally fixed by him for their distribution as the public benefit required. It seems to us clear that this would be quite within the power of the Legislature, and that the Senate, by consenting to the appointment of each appointee, would be held legally to have confirmed his appointment, not only to act as justice of the peace under his first designation, but would have given him the right to continue to exercise his powers conferred by law in any other district to which he might be transferred, because the Senate would have had full notice as to the powers which he could enjoy, and must be held to have consented to his exercise of those broader powers without further consideration and revision. This is the same case. When the Senate confirmed Severino Alberto to be a justice of the peace for San Juan del Monte, section 206, with the proviso, was in force; and when the Senate confirmed him it confirmed him with the knowledge of the possibility declared in the law that his powers and his functions as a justice of the peace upon designation of the Governor-General might be performed and exercised in another jurisdiction, if the Governor-General should think it wise in the public interest in his regulation of the conduct of justices of the peace. There is no such necessary difference between the duties of a justice of the peace in one part of the Islands and those to be performed in another part as to make such enlargement or change of his jurisdiction already provided for in existing law unreasonably beyond the scope \n\n[279 U.S. 139, 150]\n\u00a0\n of the consent to the original appointment. Such an extension of his duties is of the same kind as those provided before the proviso was enacted in respect to the merging of districts, their enlargement, or their combination by uniting one district with another under the existing justice of the peace. See Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 301\n, 13 S. Ct. 361; Southern Pacific Co. v. Bartine (C. C.) 170 F. 725, 748.\n It is constantly to be borne in mind that this whole subject-matter in respect to the institution of justices of the peace as part of the government structure in the Philippines is wholly within the control of the Legislature. If what they provide results in greater control by the Governor-General than is wise, the Legislature may repeal the provisions tomorrow and substitute some other limitations.\n Some general observations were made by the Supreme Court with reference to the necessity of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, and expressions of opinion that this independence should be preserved strictly, as it should be with respect to judges of superior court jurisdiction. It has always been recognized that justices of the peace, even in our system, are of less importance in the judiciary and must be made to conform to greater regulation than the judges of higher courts. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 38 S., 19 S. Ct. 580. Justices of the peace are judicial officers, it is true, but they are much to be differentiated from judges of the courts of record. We do not think, therefore, that the case of Borromeo v. Mariano, 41 Phil. Islands, 322, with reference to the transfer and removal of a judge of the court of first instance, has application here.\n The judgment it reversed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANCIENT EGYPTIAN ARABIC ORDER OF NOBLES OF THE MYSTIC SHRINE V.(1929)\n\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 737, 738]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harold S. Davis, of Boston, Mass., James E. White and Samuel A. T. Watkins, both of Chicago, Ill., and Moorfield Storey, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. Claude Pollard, of Austin, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a controversy between two fraternal orders, called 'Nobles of the Mystic Shrine,' one having white and the other negro members. A short reference to the origin and history of these orders will conduce to an accurate appreciation of the controversy.\n From early times there have been two distinct Masonic fraternities in the United States, one confined to white men and the other to negroes. Each has had its local lodges, grand lodges, and Supreme Lodge, and also several component bodies, including Knights Templar and Scottish Rite consistories. Both have existed in the same territory and have had similar names, rituals, and emblems, and yet have been independent and without any inter- \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 739]\n\u00a0\n relation. The white fraternity's existence in this country reaches back to early colonial times. The negro fraternity was organized in Boston in 1784, and afterwards was extended to other sections.\n The orders called 'Nobles of the Mystic Shrine' are relatively modern, originated in the United States, and are outgrowths of the Masonic fraternities just described. They were founded by Masons, and their membership is restricted to Masons-white in one case and negro in the other-who have become Knights Templars or have received the thirty-second degree in a Scottish Rite consistory. The white Masons were the first to establish an order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. They organized one in New York in 1872 for fraternal and charitable purposes. The order grew rapidly, and soon came to have local lodges, called temples, in most of the states, and also to have a national governing body called its Imperial Council. The negro Masons imitatively organized a like order for like purposes in Chicago in 1893. It also grew, although not so rapidly as the white order, and came to have many local temples in other sections of the country and to have a national governing body called its Imperial Council. The constitution, emblems and regalia of the negro order, as also the titles given to the officers of its temples and council, were all adopted in imitation of those of the white order. Another feature imitatively copied was a purely fanciful calim, once put forth by the white order and afterwards discredited, to the effect that that order was an authorized extension of an ancient and illustrious order established centuries ago in Mohammedan countries.\n Each of the orders, after becoming well organized, made it a practice to hold periodic national meetings attended with public parades and other features tending to bring attention to the order and to advance its extension. And, aside from such activities, each publicly engaged in commendable charitable work. The white order, by reason \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 740]\n\u00a0\n of its greater membership and the larger resources of its members, was able to carry that work further than the negro order could, but the contributions and efforts of the latter in that field were both helpful and substantial.\n The white order always has been a voluntary unincorporated association. In 1895 the New York Legislature passed a special act purporting to incorporate it, but the proffered incorporation was rejected. In 1893 the negro order was incorporated under the laws of Illinois, but that incorporation was abandoned; and in 1901 the order was incorporated as a fraternal and charitable association under the Act of Congress of May 5, 1870, providing for the creation of corporations in the District of Columbia, c. 80,  3, 16 Stat. 98, 101.\n The name adopted by the white order is 'Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine for North America,' and that adopted by the negro order, and under which it was incorporated, is 'Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine of North and South America and its Jurisdictions.'\n Prior to 1918, both orders established local temples in the state of Texas-in some instances in the same cities. Among the temples of the white order were one in Dallas established in 1887, one in El Paso established in 1907, and one in Houston established in 1915. Among those of the negro order were one in Dallas established in 1894, one in El Paso established in 1902, and one in Houston established in 1917\n\n\n The present suit was begun in 1918 in a state court of Texas. Originally it was brought by members of the local temple of the white order in Houston against members of the local temple of the negro order in that city to enjoin the latter from using any imitation of the name, constitution, titles, emblems, and regalia of the former. But through the voluntary intervention of other parties and a voluntary enlargement of the original pleadings, all \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 741]\n\u00a0\n with the court's leave, the suit was broadened into one between the two national orders, wherein the white order sought an injunction against the negro order restraining and preventing the latter, its lodges, officers, and members, 'throughout the state of Texas and the entire United States,' from further using the name under which it was acting, from designating its local lodges as 'temples,' from designating its members as 'Nobles' or 'Shriners,' from giving the officers of its lodges and council the titles of like officers in the white order, from using a constitution, emblems, and regalia like those of the white order, and from organizing or instituting lodges in imitation of those of that order.\n The answer of the negro order may be summarized as denying that the white order had acquired any exclusive or superior right to use the name, constitution designations, titles, emblems, and regalia before mentioned or any of them; denying that the negro order's use of such name, constitution, designations, titles, emblems, and regalia was with any wrongful or fraudulent purpose, or was other than the exercise of a right belonging to that order as a lawfully constituted fraternal and charitable association; setting up the negro order's incorporation in 1901 under the Act of Congress of May 5, 1870, and asserting that, in virtue of that act and such incorporation, the order became entitled, if not theretofore entitled, to use the name which it had been and was still using, to adopt and have a constitution, to establish and have local lodges, to select and use appropriate emblems and regalia, and to do other things properly incident to the maintenance of a fraternal and charitable order; alleging that its acts and practices were all within its rights under that incorporation; asserting that there had been and was no competition between the two orders and that the white order drew its members wholly from the white Masonic fraternity while the negro order drew its members wholly from the \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 742]\n\u00a0\n negro Masonic fraternity; and setting up that the white order, by reason of its laches and its acquiescence in the acts and practices of the negro order, was without right to an injunction or other equitable relief.\n On a trial of the issues, the court made special findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and entered a decree awarding to the white order all of the relief sought. The findings of fact included one to the effect that the imitative acts and practices of the negro order constituted 'a fraudulent deception' injurious to the white order, and another to the effect that the white order had not acquiesced in those acts and practices and was not chargeable with laches in not taking earlier steps to stop them. The conclusions of law and the decree are copied in the margin. \n1\n The decree was affirmed by the Court of Civil Ap- \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 743]\n\u00a0\n peals, Burrell v. Michaux, 273 S. W. 874, and by the Supreme Court of the state, 286 S. W. 176. The negro order then petitioned this court for a review upon writ of certiorari, and the petition was granted. \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 744]\n\u00a0\n In the state appellate courts, the negro order relied on the Act of Congress of May 5, 1870, and its incorporation thereunder, just as it had done in the trial court, and also insisted that the decree against it was not in accord with the decision of this court in Creswill v. Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246\n, 32 S. Ct. 822, where like privileges asserted under that act of Congress by a fraternal and benevolent association incorporated thereunder were involved.\n The right thus specially set up in the state court is a federal right. Whether it was denied or not given due recognition by the challenged decree, as affirmed, is a question on which the defeated claimants are entitled to \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 745]\n\u00a0\n invoke the judgment of this court, as is done in their petition for certiorari. And it is our province to inquire, not only whether the right was denied in direct terms, but also whether it was denied in substance and effect by interposing a nonfederal ground of decision having no fair support. Creswill v. Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 258\n, 261 S., 32 S. Ct. 822; Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Ct. 419; Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 44 S. Ct. 13; Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 44 S. Ct. 247; New York Central R. R. Co. v. New York & Pennsylvania Co., \n271 \nU.S. 124, 126\n, 46 S. Ct. 447.\n The record and the opinions set forth therein make it apparent that the existence within the state of Texas of local lodges of each of the two orders was not contrary to any statute of the state. The state court put its decision upon principles of general law which it deemed appli- \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 746]\n\u00a0\n cable, and not upon any local regulations. It did not wholly refuse to recognize the right set up by the negro order in virtue of the incorporation under the act of Congress, but did hold that the white order had acquired a superior and exclusive right to use the name, constitution, emblems, and regalia in question by prior adoption and use; that the subsequent adoption and use by the negro order was in derogation of that right; that the white order, in the absence of acquiescence or laches on its part, was entitled to an injunction preventing further use by the negro order; and that there had been no such acquiescence or laches as would constitute a bar to that relief, inasmuch as the negro order had been proceeding with 'a fraudulent purpose of appropriating the benefits of the (white) order to themselves.'\n Whether the rules relating to the use of trade-marks and trade-names are applicable to controversies like this between fraternal orders has been the subject of varying decisions in other courts. Without now indicating any opinion on that question, we shall indulge the assumption that the state court was right in holding those rules applicable and shall pass to another matter turning on the facts of this case, and which, as resolved by the state court, resulted in the denial of the federal right set up by the negro order. That matter is whether there was acquiescence or laches on the part of the white order. The state court held there was neither. If there was either, the white order was without any right to object to the use which it was seeking to restrain, and the negro order was entitled to continue that use in virtue of its incorporation under the Act of Congress.\n An attentive examination of the record discloses, not only that the finding on the question of laches is without fair support in the evidence, but that the evidence conclusively refutes it. \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 747]\n\u00a0\n There is no evidence of a fraudulent intent on the part of the negro order, or of a purpose on its part to induce any one, whether Mason or non- Mason, to believe that it was the white order or that they were parts of the same fraternity. On the contrary, it is shown that the negro order always held itself out as entirely distinct from the white order and as open only to members of the negro Masonic fraternity. True, there was much imitation, but this is shown to have been in the nature of emulation rather than false pretense.\n The evidence discloses that the negro order promptly entered its constitution in the Congressional Library under an act of Congress providing for copyrights; that its members openly wore its insignia as indicative of its existence and their membership; and that at its yearly national meetings the members in large numbers marched in public parades wearing its regalia.\n It is further shown that the Imperial Potentate of the white order in his address at their national meeting in 1894 called attention to the existence of the negro order and to its use of names, titles, etc., like those of the white order. He also named Texas as one of the states in which the negro order had established lodges. The address was published and distributed among the lodges and members of the white order. At several subsequent meetings there was similar mention of the negro order and its activities.\n Thus it is established that from the beginning the white order had knowledge of the existence and imitative acts and practices of the negro order. In addition, the evidence indubitably shows that with such knowledge the white order silently stood by for many years while the negro order was continuing its imitative acts and practices and was establishing new lodges, enlarging its membership, acquiring real property in its corporate name, and investing substantial sums in the copied paraphernalia, regalia, \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 748]\n\u00a0\n and emblems. It also is shown by the uncontradicted testimony of several witnesses-one a life member of the white order-that a large proportion of the copied paraphernalia, regalia, emblems, and insignia used by the negro order, its lodges and members, was purchased from or through members of the white order, and that in one instance a lodge of that order, preparatory to moving to new quarters, sold the paraphernalia and regalia used in the old quarters to a lodge of the negro order in the same city.\n The effect on the negro order of the silence and apparent acquiescence of the white order is reflected in the fact that, when this suit was brought, the former had 76 local lodges, approximately 9,000 members, and real and personal property valued at approximately $600,000 which was held and used for fraternal and charitable purposes.\n The only evidence making against that already outlined consists of a showing that a suit was instituted in Georgia in 1914 by a local lodge of the white order against a local lodge of the negro order to restrain the latter from imitating the name, emblems, and regalia of the former, and that a similar suit was begun in Arkansas a few years later-one resulting in a decree for the plaintiffs and the other in a decree for the defendants. In instituting these suits, the plaintiff lodges undoubtedly manifested strong objections to the imitative acts of the defendant lodges. But the objections came too late to overcome or weaken the force of the conduct of the white order during the 30 years preceding the earlier of the two suits. After that period of inaction and seeming acquiescence, it was too late to resuscitate the original exclusive right for which the white order is now contending. Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., \n179 \nU.S. 19, 37\n, 21 S. Ct. 7.\n What we have said of the evidence demonstrates, as we think, not only that there was obvious and long-continued \n\n[279 U.S. 737, 749]\n\u00a0\n laches on the part of the white order, but also that the circumstances were such that its laches barred it from asserting an exclusive right, or seeking equitable relief, as against the negro order. Creswill v. Knights of Pythias, \n225 U.S. 246\n, 261-263, 32 S. Ct. 822; Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., \n179 U.S. 19\n, 35-37, 21 S. Ct. 7; Piatt v. Vattier, 9 Pet. 405, 416; Hayward v.

Ct. 476; Du Boulay v. Du Boulay, L. R. 2 P. C. 430, 446.\n As it is apparent that, had this view of the question of laches prevailed in the state court, the federal right set up by the negro order must have been sustained, the decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Conclusions of Law.\n I.

Walker, or Nashville, Tenn., of counsel), for Mrs. Elise Williams as amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are three suits brought in the circuit court of Garland county, Arkansas, against the Arlington Hotel Company, a corporation of Arkansas, in which the plaintiffs seek to recover for the losses they sustained, when guests of the hotel, in the destruction by fire of their personal property. The hotel was in Hot Springs National Park.\n The complaints averred that the United States in 1904 acquired from Arkansas exclusive jurisdiction over Hot Springs Park, and that under the common law, which was there in force (Pettit v. Thomas, 103 Ark. 593, 148 S. W. 501, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 122, Ann. Cas. 1914B 726), an innkeeper was an insurer of his guests' personal property against fire. In 1913, the Arkansas Legislature enacted a law (Acts Ark. 1913, p. 934) relieving innkeepers from liability to their guests \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n for loss by fire, unless it was due to negligence. The complainants contended that this act had no force in Hot Springs Park, as it was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, that the demurrers based thereon must be overruled, and that judgments should be entered for them. The defendant denied the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and insisted that the demurrers to the complaint were good and that the defendant was entitled to judgment. There were two hearings. The circuit court first sustained the demurrers. This ruling was reversed on appeal by the Arkansas Supreme Court. 170 Ark. 440, 280 S. W. 20. Answers were then filed. The three cases were consolidated and went to a jury, and in accord with the final ruling on the demurrers resulted in verdicts and judgments for the plaintiffs, which were affirmed by the Supreme Court. 176 Ark. 613, 4 S.W.(2d) 7.\n By section 3 of the Act of Congress of April 20, 1832 (chapter 70, 4 Stat. 505), while Arkansas was still a territory, it was provided 'that the hot springs in said territory, together with four sections of land including said springs, as near the center thereof as may be, shall be reserved for the future disposal of the United States, and shall not be entered, located, or appropriated, for any other purpose whatever.'\n Arkansas was admitted to statehood in 1836 (chapter 100, 5 Stat. 50), but there was then no reservation of exclusive jurisdiction by the United States over the territory reserved from sale by the Act of 1832\n\n\n By Act of Congress of March 3, 1877 (chapter 108, 19 Stat. 377), it was made the duty of United States commissioners, after an examination of the topography of the reservation, to lay it out into convenient squares, blocks, lots, avenues, streets, and alleys, the lines of which were to correspond with the existing boundary lines of the occupants of the reservation. \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 447]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 of the act provided:\n'That before making any subdivision of said lands, as described in the preceding section, it shall be the duty of said board of commissioners, under the direction and subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, to designate a tract of land included in one boundary, sufficient in extent to include, and which shall include all the hot or warm springs situated on the lands aforesaid, to embrace, as near as may be, what is known as Hot Springs Mountain, and the same is hereby reserved from sale, and shall remain under the charge of a superintendent, to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, however, that nothing in this section shall prevent the Secretary of the Interior from fixing a special tax on water taken from said springs, sufficient to pay for the protection and necessary improvement of the same.'\n\n The Army Appropriation Act of June 30, 1882 (chapter 254, 22 Stat. 121), provided:\n'That $100,000 be, and hereby is, appropriated for the erection of an Army and Navy Hospital at Hot Springs, Arkansas, which shall be erected by and under the direction of the Secretary of War, in accordance with plans and specifications to be prepared and submitted to the Secretary of War by the Surgeons General of the Army and Navy; which hospital, when in a condition to receive patients, shall be subject to such rules, regulations, and restrictions as shall be provided by the President of the United States: Provided further, that such hospital shall be erected on the government reservation at or near Hot Springs, Arkansas.'\n\n The hospital and accessories were completed about the year 1886. They originally covered 20 acres and have been enlarged from time to time since then. They are within the territory described in section 4 of the Act of \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 448]\n\u00a0\n March 3, 1877, supra, and within the territory over which Arkansas by Act of February 21, 1903 (Acts of Arkansas 1903, Act 30, p. 52), ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the United States. The language of the cession was as follows:\n'Section 1. That exclusive jurisdiction over that part of the Hot Springs Reservation known and described as a part of the Hot Springs Mountain, and whose limits are particularly described by the following boundary lines, ... all in township two south, range nineteen west, in the county of Garland, state of Arkansas, being a part of the permanent United States Hot Springs Reservation, is hereby ceded and granted to the United States of America to be exercised so long as the same shall remain the property of the United States: Provided, that this grant of jurisdiction shall not prevent the execution of any process of the state, civil or criminal, on any person who may be on such reservation or premises; provided, further, that the right to tax all structures and other property in private ownership on the Hot Springs Reservation accorded to the state by the Act of Congress approved March 3rd, 1901 (1891), is hereby reserved to the state of Arkansas.'\n\n By the Act of April 20, 1904 (chapter 1400, 33 Stat. 187), congress accepted this cession and directed that the land should be under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and all laws applicable to places under such sole and exclusive jurisdiction should have full force and effect therein:\n'Provided, that nothing in this act shall be so construed as to forbid the service within said boundaries of any civil or criminal process of any court having jurisdiction in the state of Arkansas; that all fugitives from justice taking refuge within said boundaries shall, on due application to the executive of said state, whose warrant may lawfully run within said territory for said purpose, be subject to the laws which apply to fugitives from justice found in the state of Arkansas.' Section 1 (16 USCA  372). \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 449]\n\u00a0\n The act further provided that it should not be so construed as to interfere with the right of the state to tax all structures and other property in private ownership within the coundaries described.\n\n Section 2 (16 USCA  372) provided that the cession should constitute a part of the Eastern United States Judicial District of Arkansas, and the District and Circuit Courts of the United States for the District should have jurisdiction of all offenses committed within the boundaries.\n The Arlington Hotel was constructed upon one acre of this tract thus subsequently ceded to the United States and accepted by it, and the hotel was operated for more than 50 years under lease from the United States until its destruction by fire on April 5, 1923.\n The territory included in the cession forms only a small part of the original reservation by the United States from settlement under the land laws. It includes the springs and is about 1,800 feet long and 4,000 feet wide. There is also a larger Hot Springs reservation of over 900 acres, owned by the United States, but under the jurisdiction of Arkansas, and reserved from sale by the government for parks. The hospital buildings are about 1,000 feet from the site of the Arlington Hotel. By Act of Congress of March 4, 1921 (chapter 161, 41 Stat. 1407), the ceded tract was given the name of the Hot Springs National Park.\n The contention of the defendant is that the cession was invalid, and that no jurisdiction was thereby conferred on the United States for the reason that the only power the United States has to receive exclusive jurisdiction of land within a state is to be found in the words of article 1,  8, clause 17, of the Federal Constitution, as follows: 'to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings.' \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 450]\n\u00a0\n The leading case on the subject is Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, \n114 \nU.S. 525\n, 5 S. Ct. 995. The question there was whether a railroad running into the military reservation of Ft. Leavenworth was subject to taxation by the state of Kansas. The United States had had exclusive jurisdiction over the land in question from 1803 by the cession of France until the admission of Kansas into the Union. For many years before such admission the land had been reserved from sale by the United States for military purposes and occupied as a military post. Until the admission of Kansas of course the governmental jurisdiction of the United States was complete. But when Kansas came into the Union in 1861 on an equal footing with the original states, the previous military reservation was not excepted from the succeeding jurisdiction of the new state. The Attorney General recommended a state cession of jurisdiction, but it was not given until February, 1875, when the Kansas Legislature enacted:\n'That exclusive jurisdiction be, and the same is hereby ceded to the United States over and within all the territory owned by the United States, and included within the limits of the United States military reservation known as the Fort Leavenworth Reservation in said state, as declared from time to time by the President of the United States, saving, however, to the said state the right to serve civil or criminal process within said reservation, in suits or prosecutions for or on account of rights acquired, obligations incurred, or crimes committed in said state, but outside of said cession and reservation; and saving further to said state the right to tax railroad, bridge, and other corporations, their franchises and property, on said reservation.' Laws of Kansas 1875, p. 95, c. 66.\n\n The last words seemed to save fully the right of the state to tax the railway. But as the Constitution provided that Congress should have power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all places purchased by the consent \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 451]\n\u00a0\n of the Legislature of the state in which the same should be for the erection of forts, etc., the railroad company contended that no right to tax a railroad on the reservation could be retained by the state and that the saving clause was void.\n In answering this claim, the court pointed out that the United States, without the consent of a state, might purchase or condemn for its own use state land for a national purpose, and that, without any consent or cession by he state, such jurisdiction would attach as was needed to enable the United States to use it for the purpose for which it had been purchased. The court held that in such a case, when the purpose ceased, the jurisdiction of the federal government ceased. But the court further held that when a formal cession was made by the state to the United States, after the original purchase of the ownership of the land had been made, the state and the government of the United States could frame the cession and acceptance of governmental jurisdiction, so as to divide the jurisdiction between the two as the two parties might determine, provided only they saved enough jurisdiction for the United Stated to enable it to carry out the purpose of the acquisition of jurisdiction. The court therefore held that a saving clause in the language of the cession requiring that the railroad should pay taxes was not invalid, but was in accord with the power of both parties and might be enforced. This decided the point in the case.\n Mr. Justice Field, in elaborating the opinion, said that if the act of cession of exclusive jurisdiction adopted subsequently to the purchase of the land was followed by a failure of the United States to continue to use the land for any purpose for which it was purchased, the exclusive jurisdiction would lapse. This statement that, after the formal cession by the state of exclusive jurisdiction had been accepted by the United States, there was \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 452]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless a reverter of the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States though conveyed in the formal cession without limitation, is said by counsel for appellees not to have been necessary for the decision.\n In Benson v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 325\n, 13 S. Ct. 60, Benson was indicted in a federal court for murder committed in the Ft. Leavenworth Military Reservation within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and the first question was one of jurisdiction. It was contended that the evidence showed that the murder was committed on a particular part of the reservation which was used solely for farming purposes, but the court held that in matters of this kind the courts followed the action of the political department of the government; that the entire tract had been legally reserved for military purposes (United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 527), and that the character and purpose of its occupation having been officially and legally established by that branch of the government which had control over such matters, it was not open to the courts on question of jurisdiction to inquire what might be the actual uses to which any portion of the reservation was temporarily put. There was therefore jurisdiction, and the objection was overruled.\n In Palmer v. Barrett, \n162 \nU.S. 399\n, 16 S. Ct. 837, the United States acquired title to navy yard lands in the state of New York, the record not disclosing how. In an appropriation act Congress empowered the Secretary of War to sell and convey part of these to any purchaser, provided that they should not be sold at less price than they cost the government, and provided that prior to the sale of the lands exclusive jurisdiction should be ceded to the United States of all the remaining lands connected with the Navy Yard belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction was ceded by the state to the United States, but the act of cession contained the proviso that the United States could 'retain such use and jurisdiction as long as the prem- \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 453]\n\u00a0\n ises described shall be used for the purposes for which jurisdiction is ceded, and no longer.' The land in question in the case was not to be used by the United States for a navy yard or naval hospital, but was a part of the vacant land adjoining the Navy Yard which had been leased by the United States to the city of Brooklyn for market purposes. A direct consideration was received by the United States for the lease, since it provided that a supply of water for the purpose of the Navy Yard at reduced rates would be furnished by the city to the United States during the use by the former of lands covered by the lease. This court said:\n'In the absence of any proof to the contrary, it is to be considered that the lease was valid, and that both parties to it received the benefits stipulated in the contract. This being true, the case then presents the very contingency contemplated by the act of cession, that is, the exclusion from the jurisdiction of the United States of such portion of the ceded land not used for the governmental purposes of the United States therein specified. Assuming, without deciding, that, if the cession of jurisdiction to the United States had been free from condition or limitation, the land should be treated and considered as within the sole jurisdiction of the United States, it is clear that under the circumstances here existing, in view of the reservation made by the state of New York in the act ceding jurisdiction, the exclusive authority of the United States over the land covered by the lease was at least suspended whilst the lease remained in force.'\n\n It is apparent that the court intended to leave open the question whether, had the cession of jurisdiction been complete and without limitation, the United States would have retained its exclusive jurisdiction.\n Counsel for the plaintiffs in the present case insist that the United States has the constitutional authority to maintain exclusive jurisdiction over the tract here in ques- \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 454]\n\u00a0\n tion as a national park, and that as the government undoubtedly may use its control over all land within its exclusive jurisdiction to provide national parks, it may, where land is ceded by a state to the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government, treat land thus ceded by the state for such a purpose as it would treat national public land which had never come within the jurisdiction of the state; that as by virtue of article 4 of the Constitution, section 3, Congress has power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, it may treat land ceded to it by a state for the purposes of making a national park exactly as it would treat land which had always been within its exclusive jurisdiction and subject to its disposition for park purposes. This issue may in the future become a subject of constitutional controversy, because some twenty or more parks have been created by Congress, in a number of which exclusive jurisdiction over the land has been conferred by act of cession of the state.\n We do not find it necessary, however, now to examine this question. We think that the history of this Hot Springs National Park, as shown by the legislation leading to its establishment and circumstances which the court may judicially notice, is such that the small tract whose jurisdiction is here in question may be brought within the principle of the Lowe Case and other cases already cited.\n The Hot Springs are mentioned as remarkable by Thomas Jefferson in a message to Congress on February 19, 1806, in which he transmitted a report containing a description of them. Messages, Reports, etc., 1st Sess. 6th Cong. 1806, pp. 202, 344. Their known value for remedial purposes and the appreciation of that value by Congress were shown in the act of 1832, already cited by which the land surrounding them was reserved for the future disposal of the United States. The purpose was evidently to make use of them for national public needs.\n The analysis of the 44 springs indicated that \n\n[278 U.S. 439, 455]\n\u00a0\n these waters were of a special excellence with respect to diseases likely to be treated in a military hospital. Therefore it was that in 1882 an appropriation of $100,000 was made for the construction of an adequate hospital under the War Department. That hospital has been enlarged by appropriations from time to time since its original establishment. It was certainly a wise prevision which with the consent of the state brought within exclusive national jurisdiction the hospital buildings and accessories and all the 44 springs from which the healing waters came, in order to secure to the government their complete police protection, preservation, and control. This justified acquisition of the springs and hospital for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States under clause 17, section 8, article 1, of the Constitution. Nor is the constitutional basis for acquisition any less effective because the springs thus kept safely available for the federal purpose do in the abundance of their flow also supply water sufficient to furnish aid to the indigent and to those of the public of the United States who are able to pay for hotel accommodation on the little park surrounding the hospital and the springs. Benson v. United States, supra, and Williams v. Arlington Hotel Co. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 669.\n The cases relied on by the defendant are clearly distinguishable. Williams v. Arlington Hotel Co. (D. C.) 15 F.(2d) 412, was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals, as above. In Crook, Horner & Co. v. Old Point Comfort Hotel Co. (C. C.) 54 F. 604, there was an express reverter clause in the act of cession, which limited the use of the land to defensive purposes. Renner v. Bennett, 21 Ohio St. 431, and State v. Board of Commissioners, 153 Ind. 302, 54 N. E. 809, were cases where Congress had receded jurisdiction to the state. In La Duke v. Melin, 45 N. D. 349, 177 N. W. 673, there had been complete abandonment of a military reservation, which by act of Congress had been opened to homesteaders.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T & S F RY. CO. v. U S(1929)\nNo. 466\nArgued: April 11, 1929Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 768, 770]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. S. Outlaw and Elmer Westlake, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. D. W. Knowlton, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Frank H. Towner, of Chicago, Ill., for Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for northern Illinois, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 USCA  47), to enjoin and annul an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission entered July 6, 1927. That order directed the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and two other railroads to cancel proposed tariffs increasing the respective grain rates from numerous country points in Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska to Kansas City, Mo., and Wichita, Kan. Grain and Grain Products from Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska to Gulf Ports for Export, 129 I. C. C. 261. Those three carriers are the plaintiffs. Besides the United States and the Commission, the Kansas City Southern and certain other carriers, which compete with the plaintiffs for the grain export traffic from Kansas City to Gulf ports, are the defendants. The District Court, three judges sitting, denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. 33 F.(2d) 345. The case is here on direct appeal from the final decree. We are of opinion that it should be affirmed.\n The legal question presented is not dependent upon the fact that the tariffs challenged are those of three inde- \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 771]\n\u00a0\n pendent railroads; nor upon the fact that the rates are different for wheat than for some other grain; nor upon the fact that the tariff of each railroad includes differing rates from numerous country points in each of the three states; nor upon the fact that some of the rates from those points are for transportation to Kansas City, and some to Wichita; nor upon the fact that there are several railroads which, as competitors of the plaintiffs for traffic from those cities to several Gulf ports, are affected by the rates challenged. The statement of the facts may therefore be simplified by limiting it to a single rate of one of the plaintiff carriers for wheat to Kansas City, and showing the effect of that increased rate on one of that carrier's competitors for traffic from that market to a single Gulf port.\n The Santa Fe has a line direct from Dodge City, Kan., to the Gulf, via which its through rate on wheat for export is 47 cents per 100 pounds. It has also a line from Dodge City, via Kansas City, to the Gulf, on which its through rate, prior to 1924, was 51 cents, being the sum (or sombination) of the local rate from Dodge City to Kansas City (20.5 cents) and the standard proportional rate from Kansas City to the Gulf (30.5 cents).1 Usually, the volume of grain in storage at Kansas City is large, as it is an important primary grain market. The Kansas City Southern has no line from Dodge City to Kansas City. \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 772]\n\u00a0\n But it has a line from Kansas City to the Gulf, and its standard proportional rate also is 30.5 cents per 100 pounds. Prior to 1924 the Southern was in a position to compete on equal terms with the Santa Fe for the transportation to the Gulf of the grain from Dodge City on storage in Kansas City. In that year, the Santa Fe reduced its through rate from Dodge City to the Gulf via Kansas City to 47 cents. Thereby the Santa Fe 's net proportional rate from Kansas City to the Gulf was reduced 4 cents; that is, from 30.5 cents to 26.5 cents. For, under a practice prevailing at primary grain markets, known as the through rates with transit privilege, one who reships grain on the same railroad which had brought it into the market is entitled to reship on what is called the balance of the through rate. That is, a discount is allowed equal to the difference between the through rate from the point of its origin to the destination ultimately selected and the sum of the standard inbound and outbound rates.\n Thus the Southern was disabled from competing with the Santa Fe for the transportation from Kansas City to the Gulf of grain in storage at Kansas City which had come from Dodge City. For the Santa Fe refused to establish a similar through route via the Southern from Kansas City, and the Commission did not order it. Compare St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136\n, 38 S. Ct. 49. The Southern undertook to help itself. It filed a tariff with what is called a varying proportional rate, by lowering to 26.5 its own rate from Kansas City to the Gulf on such grain as had come to Kansas City from Dodge City. \n2\n The Santa Fe protested to the Com- \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 773]\n\u00a0\n mission against the Southern's varying proportional rate; but the Commission refused to suspend it. \n3\n Then the Santa Fe , in order to exclude the Southern, filed the tariff here in question, imposing the 4-cent addition to its Kansas City rate on any Dodge City grain that should later be reshipped over the Southern's line. It is this conditional addition of 4 cents to the Dodge City-Kansas City rate which the Commission ordered canceled.\n The order followed extensive hearings before the Commission, had after suspension of the tariffs pursuant to paragraph 7 of section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15(7). Since the proposed tariff involved an increase in the rate, the burden of justifying the increase before the Commission was imposed upon the carrier by paragraph 7 of section 15, if applicable. Moreover, to make an additional charge for having brought merchandise into a city, if it should afterwards be shipped out, is on its face unreasonable. And it is discriminatory to make that additional charge only \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 774]\n\u00a0\n if the outbound shipment is over one of several possible railroads. The Santa Fe made no attempt to justify the increase. It contended that the general rules of law concerning reasonableness of rates are not applicable, and that the Commission lacked power to order the rate canceled, because by so doing it compelled the Santa Fe to participate in a through route and rate, and thereby shorthaul itself, in disregard of the limitations imposed by paragraph 4 of section 15 upon the Commission's power to establish through routes. Compare United States v. Missouri Pacific R. R., \n278 \nU.S. 269\n, 49 S. Ct. 133, 73 L. Ed. -.\n The Santa Fe , regarding the grain in storage at Kansas City as tonnage which, although temporarily held in abeyance, is in the course of a through movement and, as such, is to be held on its lines, makes this argument: At the time that the canceled tariff was filed, the Santa Fe had a through route on its own lines from Dodge City via Kansas City to the Gulf, and there existed no through route from Dodge City to the Gulf via the Southern from Kansas City. The Santa Fe was therefore legally entitled to carry to the Gulf at the through rate all Dodge City grain stored at Kansas City, which had been brought in by it. The Southern's varying proportional rate on Dodge City grain enabled the Southern to secure some of this grain. The Santa Fe 's proposed varying rate was essential to prevent that invasion of its right not to be short-hauled on Dodge City grain. By ordering its proposed tariff canceled, the Commission made possible a through route via the Southern which compelled the Santa Fe to short haul itself. As the Commission was prohibited by paragraph 4 of section 15 from establishing a through route via the Southern, which would short-haul the Santa Fe , Congress must have intended to deny to it also the power to cancel as unreasonable a tariff which was essential to the preservation of the Santa Fe 's long haul. \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 775]\n\u00a0\n A supplemetal argument is made by the Santa Fe to overcome the finding of the Commission that at the time when the tariff here in question was filed, there already existed (without any order by the Commission) a through route for grain over the Santa Fe from Dodge City to Kansas City and thence to the Gulf via the Southern. Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 136, 139\n, 38 S. Ct. 49; Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 666\n, 47 S. Ct. 222. The supplemental argument is this: Since the Commission could not have ordered this through route via the Southern, it could not prevent the Santa Fe 's withdrawing from the same. \n4\n Its proposed tariff was in effect a withdrawal; for, as the bill alleges, the rates were 'published, not for the purpose of facilitating movement via the routes in connection with which they were published, but were published by plaintiffs to preclude and prevent movement via such routes.' We have no occasion to consider the issue of fact whether there was in existence, when the Santa Fe filed its proposed tariff, a through route from Dodge City via the Southern from Kansas City; nor need we consider the issue of law whether, if there was such a route in existence, the Commission would have been powerless, by reason of paragraph 4 of section 15, to prevent the Santa Fe 's withdrawal \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 776]\n\u00a0\n from it. For we are of opinion that, although the Santa Fe brought the grain into Kansas City, there is nothing in the situation which precluded the Commission from canceling the Santa Fe 's proposed tariff as being unreasonable.\n First. In ordering cancellation of the proposed tariff the Commission exercised only its function of determining the reasonableness of rates. It made a rate order to which the matter or routing was merely an incident. The Santa Fe calls the proposed rate, by which it undertook to add 4 cents to the Dodge City-Kansas City rate, if the grain should be reshipped on the Southern, proportional. To call it proportional is misleading. \n5\n But, if it were truly a part of a through rate, the fact would be without legal significance. The Commission's power to declare rates unreasonable applies alike to all rates, be they joint, local, or proportional. The Commission may, and in controversies involving through rates often does, deal with one factor only of the combination of rates which make up the through rate, and that factor may be a proportional rate. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The broad power to pass on the reasonableness of rates conferred upon the Commission in 1887 has not been in terms limited by any amendatory act. On the other hand, there has been much legislation designed to make the power more effective. \n7\n The special power to establish \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 777]\n\u00a0\n through routes and joint rates was not conferred until 1906. Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  4, 34 Stat. 584. There is not, in that act as amended ( see United States v. American Ry. Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 430\n, 44 S. Ct. 560, note 2), or in any decision of this court construing it,8 or in any of the decisions of the Commission applying it, to which attention has been called,9 the slightest basis for the suggestion that, in conferring the restricted power to establish through routes, Congress intended to limit the theretofore unrestricted power of the Commission to pass upon the reasonableness of rates. Compare Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318, 323\n, 43 S. Ct. 583.\n Second. The contention that the Santa Fe 's canceled tariff was legally part of a through rate is also unsound. The argument rests upon a fiction-the fiction of a through rate with transit privilege. As applied here, the fiction is inconsistent with every fact of legal significance. When grain is shipped from a country point to a primary market, its ultimate disposition is rarely known. Who the owner of the grain will be when it reaches the primary market is uncertain. It may be sold en route before arrival there. While stored there, it may be resold several times. Some of it may be consumed in local flour mills. Most of that stored in local elevators will probably be shipped out. But until the grain is shipped out it will not be known to what place, or even in what direc- \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 778]\n\u00a0\n tion, or by what railroad, it will be carried. Southern Kansas Grain Ass'n v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 139 I. C. C. 641, 666. The treatment of substantially all grain coming from the country point is this: The bill of lading is for a shipment from the country point to the primary market. There is nothing in any of the papers connected with that transportation to indicate that the grain has a destination beyond the primary market. Upon arrival there, the owner requires delivery to be made at such elevator or other place as he selects. The freight charges are paid; the amount being the full local rate for transportation from the country point to the primary market. \n10\n The car is then released; and the movement-called inbound-ends.\n The practice by which grain shipped to a primary market is given, when shipped out, the benefit of the low rate which would normally have applied if the grain had actually been shipped from the country point through to its ultimate destination, antedates the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act. Transit Act, 24 I. C. C. 340, 348. The benefit attaching to grain shipped into the primary market is commonly so broad that it is transferable, not only to another owner of the same grain, but to like grain coming from the same country point. Thus the owner of any grain in Kansas City can get the benefit of the proportional rate out for Dodge City grain by making proof that he had brought from there into the market, within the period of 12 months, an equivalent quantity of like grain. This he may do, although it appears that the grain which he brought in was actually consumed \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 779]\n\u00a0\n in Kansas City. \n11\n Alleged Unlawful Rates and Practices in the Transportation of Grain and Grain Products, 7 I. C. C. 240, 247; In re Substitution of Tonnage at Transit Points, 18 I. C. C. 280; Transit Case, 24 I. C. C. 340.12 The practice prevails often, even where the haul to the primary market is out of line; that is, is not on the direct route from the point of origin to the point which ultimately becomes the destination of the grain.\n When the outbound shipment from Kansas City is made, the grain goes forward on a new bill of lading at the balance of the through rate. Obviously this practice cannot convert the independent shipment of grain from Kansas City to the Gulf via the Southern into a through movement from Dodge City to the Gulf. The two transportation services are not only entirely distinct, but they are often rendered in respect to wholly different merchandise. This convenient fiction is employed as a justifica- \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 780]\n\u00a0\n tion for the discrimination involved in giving rates lower than those ordinarily applicable to the service outbound. It is, of course, true that a carload of grain might be shipped from Dodge City to the Gulf as a through shipment, although under the transit privilege it is to break bulk at Kansas City, and the grain is not only to be stored there, but is to be treated or even converted into flour, before it proceeds on its journey to the Gulf. See Central R. R. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 247\n, 42 S. Ct. 80. Compare Texas & New Orleans R. R. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111\n, 33 S. Ct. 229; Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern R. R. v. Settle, \n260 \nU.S. 166\n, 43 S. Ct. 28; Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, \n279 \nU.S. 95\n, 49 S. Ct. 292, 73 L. Ed. -. But the grain with which the carriers are here concerned is not that so shipped from Dodge City to the Gulf. It is grain whose only destination, when shipped from Dodge City, was Kansas City. Such reshipment under the transit privilege is also entirely unlike the through shipment effected under the reconsignment or diversion privilege. See Reconsignment Case, 47 I. C. C. 590; Wood v. New York, Philadelphia & Norfolk R. R., 53 I. C. C. 183, 185; Carolina Portland Cement Co. v. Director General, 83 I. C. C. 388, 391.\n The grain, while in storage at Kansas City, is, in every sense, free grain. When delivered to elevators in Kansas City the Santa Fe 's charges for the carriage to Kansas City were fully paid. Its legal interest therein ended then. If the consignee or his successor in title should at any time thereafter conclude to ship elsewhere grain which he had brought into Kansas City, he was at liberty to select not only the destination, but the carrier by which it should be transported. And every railroad serving Kansas City had like liberty to compete for the traffic. There is no rule of law or practice which gives to a carrier the right to recapture traffic which it originated. Compare United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 523\n, 44 S. Ct. 189; United States v. American Ry. Express Co., 265 U. S. \n\n[279 U.S. 768, 781]\n\u00a0\n 425, 44 S. Ct. 560. Moreover, here the competition is not for transportation of the identical merchandise.\n Third. In this court there is a faint contention that the evidence before the Commission did not support the finding of unreasonableness. It was not made either before the Commission or the District Court and is clearly unfounded. See Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 47 S. Ct. 222; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 580\n, 47 S. Ct. 727. There is also a suggestion that the Commission should have suspended and ordered canceled the Southern's varying proportional rate. Its action in that respect is not subject to review in this proceeding.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A through rate is ordinarily lower than the combination of the local rates. When a through rate is made by combination of rates for intermediate distances, the rate for the later link in the shipment is, when lower than the local, spoken of as a proportional rate. See Hocking Valley R. Co. v. Lackawanna Coal & Lumber Co. (C. C. A.) 224 F. 930, 931; also, Railroad Commissioners of Kansas v. A., T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 22 I. C. C. 407; Swift & Co. v.

C. 368. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This varying proportional rate was less advantageous to the Southern than if a joint rate had been established by agreement with the Santa Fe . For, in acting alone, the Southern was obliged to absorb the whole of the 4-cent reduction; whereas, if the Santa Fe had joined with the Southern in establishing a through route and joint rate, the 4-cent reduction would presumably have been divided between the two carriers. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Varying proportional rates had been approved in Export Rates on Grain, 31 I. C. C. 616. The occasion for such rates and their operation are described in Southern Kansas Grain Association v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 139 I. C. C. 641, 653. 'The method of publication may be briefly explained by the statement that proportional rates are provided from Kansas City in varying amounts, depending upon the point of origin of the grain, which, when added to the local rates into Kansas City, are equal to the specific rates published by the lines which originate the grain. If these varying proportionals or balances were not maintained, the lines which serve Kansas City, but not the grain fields, would be compelled to apply the flat proportional rate of 30.5 cents from that market to the Gulf ports. That flat proportional exceeds the balances maintained by other lines, and therefore would attract little, if any, traffic. By providing these varying proportionals, the lines serving Kansas City have placed themselves on a competitive basis for the outbound movement of grain stored at that point.'

The proof that the shipper brought grain into the market entitling him to the reduction is made by presentation of what is called 'expense bills.' This substitution has by some carriers been extended to grain coming from other country points with rates equally favorable to the carrier. The validity of that practice has at times been questioned.

Davis, the administrator of his estate, brought this action against the Railroad Company in a common pleas court of South Carolina. The declaration alleged that the injury was caused by the negligence of the Railroad Company in failing to provide Richards a safe place in which to work. At the conclusion of the evidence the Railroad Company moved for a directed verdict. This was denied. The jury found for the administrator; and the judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 147 S. E. 834.\n It is unquestioned that the case is controlled by the Federal Employers' Liability Act,1 under which it was prosecuted. Hence, if it appears from the record that under the applicable principles of law as interpreted by the Federal courts, the evidence was not sufficient in kind or amount to warrant a finding that the negligence of the Railroad Company was the cause of the death, the judgment must be reversed. Gulf, etc., R. R. v. Wells, \n275 \nU.S. 455, 457\n, 48 S. Ct. 151; and cases cited.\n Richards was injured while on a steam shovel standing by the side of the railroad track that was being operated \n\n[279 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n by an independent contractor employed by the Railroad Company to fill in trestles on its lines. With this steam shovel the contractor excavated dirt from the railroad right of way and loaded it upon a train of dump cars, which was hauled to the trestles, where the dirt was deposited. The contractor furnished and operated the steam shovel, and also furnished the train of cars. The Railroad Company furnished the locomotive and train crew 'for the operation of the contractor's train while on the railroad tracks,' and hauled the train of cars to and from the trestles.\n Richards was employed by the Railroad Company as a member of the train crew. He was the flagman, and his duty was to put out flags and protect the train from collisions.\n In excavating and loading the dirt the steam shovel was stationed at a convenient distance on the side of the railroad track. The accessible dirt was excavated and loaded on the train of cars standing on the track. As each car was loaded the train was moved to get the loaded car out of the way and bring the next car into position for loading. For this it was necessary to signal the engineer to move the train. This was sometimes done by the shovel operator by the use of a whistle, and sometimes by the contractor's crew of laborers who were used 'to spot cars,' that is, watch the loading and signal to the engineer. One of these laborers, called a 'spotter,' was used for this particular purpose. The evidence shows, however, that the cars were frequently spotted by members of the train crew. This appears to have been entirely voluntary on their part. The contractor had never requested that they be required to do this, and the conductor of the train, who was in sole charge of the crew, had never directed them to spot the cars. The conductor also sometimes voluntarily spotted cars, and he had seen other members of the crew thus engaged; but, understanding \n\n[279 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n that, like himself, they were doing this voluntarily, did not stop them from doing this work when they chose.\n The main platform of the steam shovel was occupied by a 'shovel house' covering the engine and boiler. By the side of this was a running board extending to the front corner post of the shovel house. In front of the shovel house was a crane, having a revolving boom about thirty feet long, to which a dipper stick and scoop was attached. This scooped up the dirt, and by a circular movement of the boom was brought into position for loading the dirt on the cars. When the shovel was stationed in the position occupied on the day of the accident, at a considerable distance from the track, this required a 'full swing' of the boom. Between the shovel house and the crane there was an upright steel frame which prevented the boom from striking the shovel house. But attached to the side of the boom several feet from its base was an iron ladder, which would pass above the steel frame, and when the boom made a full swing the lower part of the ladder would come within four inches of the upper part of the corner post of the shovel house. In front of the running board and at the side of the steel frame the upper end of a 'jack-arm,' planted in the ground to steady the shovel, projected above the platform. This was not only so small as to afford an insecure footing, but it was so high and so located that if any one standing on it did not move out of the way when the boom made a full swing he would necessarily be struck by the iron ladder and crushed against the corner post of the shovel house.\n While it does not appear that any specific place had ever been assigned for the spotter, the uncontradicted evidence shows that there were at least four safe places in which he could stand without danger of being struck by the revolving boom: 1. On the running board by the side of the shovel house, this being the position usually taken; 2, on the top of a loaded car, this being the posi- \n\n[279 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n tion frequently taken; 3, inside of the shovel house, from which he could signal the engineer through an open window; and 4, on the ground, on the opposite side of the track from the shovel.\n While a brakeman stated that he had sometimes stood on the 'jack-bar' to spot cars when it was very hot-it being protected from the sun at certain hours of the day-he added that when he had done this, realizing the danger, he had watched the boom 'very, very carefully;' and it did not appear that he had ever stood there when the shovel was stationed in a position requiring the boom to make a full swing. Neither the conductor nor the contractor's manager had ever seen any one standing on the jack- arm while spotting. And the shovel operator, who had once seen Richards on the jack-arm at a time when the shovel was not running, had told him that it was a dangerous place and 'to never get caught there or he would get killed.'\n There was also evidence that if a railroad caboose had been attached to the end of the train a spotter could with safety have signalled the engineer from the windows of the cupola; but it appeared that he could not have efficiently spotted the cars from this position as the roof would have prevented him from seeing when they had been loaded.\n On the day of the accident Richards, without any order from the conductor, voluntarily took the place of a brakeman who had been engaged in spotting the cars. He first mounted on the running board by the side of the shovel house in the position which the brakeman had occupied. Shortly thereafter, for some unexplained reason-possibly to get away from the heat of the sun-he left this position of safety and got on the jack-arm; and while standing there was struck by the iron ladder when the boom swung into position for loading a car, and received the injuries which resulted in his death. That this was the manner \n\n[279 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n of his death is demonstrated by the undisputed physical facts, and is not controverted.\n We pass without determination the question whether the case was properly submitted to the jury to determine whether Richards at the time of the accident was engaged within the scope of his employment by the Railroad Company or was merely aiding the contractor as a volunteer. However this may be it is clear that, even if the Railroad Company then owed him any duty in this respect, there was no substantial evidence that there was any negligence upon its part in failing to furnish a safe place in which to work. The evidence is undisputed that there were several places in which he could have stood in spotting cars, all of which were reasonably safe and well adapted to the performance of the work, and in which he could not have been struck by the swinging boom. And the inevitable conclusion from all the evidence is that he voluntarily abandoned the safe position on the running board which he at first assumed and placed himself in a position of extreme danger on the 'jack-arm,' a place not furnished for the performance of this work and ill adapted thereto, and one of obvious danger in which he would inevitably be struck if the boom made a full swing unless he moved out of its path; and thereby through his own negligence, as the sole and direct cause of the accident, brought on his own death. Under these circumstances there is plainly no ground upon which the liability of the Railroad Company may be predicated. Compare Gt. Northern Ry. v. Wiles, \n240 \nU.S. 444, 448\n, 36 S. Ct. 406; Southern Ry. v. Gray, \n241 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 36 S. Ct. 558; Frese v. C. B. & Q. R. R., \n263 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 44 S. Ct. 1; Davis v. Kennedy, \n266 \nU.S. 147, 148\n, 45 S.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Davis, \n279 \nU.S. 34, 35\n, 49 S. Ct. 210 (73 L. Ed. -), and cases cited.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 787, 789]\n\u00a0\n Driggers had been employed by the Railroad Company for about five years, and for about six months had been a member of a switching crew. He was injured by stepping off the footboard of the switch engine while it was in motion and striking the engine of a local passenger train that was passing along an adjacent track.\n The scene of the accident was about three miles north of Charleston, within the yard limits, at a point where the Railroad Company has parallel double tracks, running north and south; the eastern being the northbound main line; and the western, the southbound main line. These lines are about 12 feet apart measured from center to center, with a clearance of 7 feet 8 1\/2 inches from rail to rail. The tracks are practically straight, and for a distance of about 2,000 feet to the north there is no obstruction to the view along the tracks. Leading from the northbound main line there is a spur track-called the Etiwan Lead-running in a northeasterly course, on a northerly curve, to a coal yard. The switch for this spur track is controlled by a lever on the east side of the main line. In leaving the main line and proceeding along the spur track for about three car lengths, that is about 120 feet, the view to the north along the main line tracks was unobstructed; but beyond this distance there was shrubbery and a billboard on the north side of the track which obstructed the view to the north. This spur track was used by the switching crew every day, sometimes more than once. On the day of the accident-which was clear and bright-the switch engine left Charleston and went up the northbound main line for the purpose of transferring some cars on the Etiwan Lead to a connection point with the Southern Railway that was some distance to the north. To do this it was necessary to go on the spur track, cut out a car, return to the northbound main line with the cars to be transferred, and shove them up that line to the connection point where the cars were to be delivered. \n\n[279 U.S. 787, 790]\n\u00a0\n On approaching the Etiwan Lead the conductor of the switching crew, after telling Driggers-who was the brakeman-to cut out a car, got down and opened the switch for the spur track. He then left the switch open,1 and walked across the north and south lines and adjoining double tracks of the Southern Railway, to a point about 15 or 20 feet west of the Southern Railway tracks, to look for a train.\n Meanwhile the switch engine went on the spur track, and after doing the necessary switching work, returned with the attached cars to the main line, moving at about six miles an hour, upgrade. The engine was in front- facing the switch. Driggers was standing on the righthand footboard in front of the engine. In going over the last portion of the spur track, where the vision to the north was unobstructed, he was facing nearly south, and could not see to the northward without looking back. He was expecting that after the switching train had gone on the northbound line the cars would be shoved back up that line to the connection point. But as the switch had been left open it would not have to be turned until the cars had passed down the main line beyond it, when it would have to be closed so that the train might pass back up the line.\n Just as the switch engine reached the northbound main line, proceeding southwardly down that line, the conductor, who had heard the whistle of a passenger train on the southbound main line and saw the approaching train, tried to call the attention of Driggers-who was looking at him at the time-to the train, pointed to it and told him to stay on the footboard. The exhaust on the switch engine prevented him from hearing what the conductor said. The signal which the conductor gave to show him \n\n[279 U.S. 787, 791]\n\u00a0\n that the passenger train was coming was the same signal which would tell him that the switching train was to back up the northbound main line. The only answer that Driggers gave was a nod of the head, indicating that he understood that the switching train was to be shoved back up that line. Thereupon, despite the noise from the exhaust of the switch engine, without looking back to see whether any train was approaching, and without having received any signal to dismount from the switch engine for any purpose whatever, and while the switch engine was in motion entering upon the southbound line, Driggers stepped off the right end of the footboard in the space between the northbound and southbound lines and swung or was thrown into the pilot sill of the engine of the passenger train on the southbound line, which was passing at that moment, and was instantly crushed and killed.\n The undisputed evidence shows that Driggers had no duty which required him to dismount from the switch engine at that time, but was supposed to remain on the engine, although it was optional for him to get off and throw the switch.\n On the other hand, the undisputed evidence shows that the passenger train, which was a few minutes behind time, and was running from 35 to at least 50 miles an hour, had a clear and unobstructed right of way on the southbound line. The engineer was on the lookout ahead, had blown signals at a point about 2,000 feet to the north, and again before reaching the scene of the accident; and the automatic bell on the engine, which he had set in motion, was ringing continuously up to the time of the accident. There was no obstruction whatever on the line ahead. Although the engineer saw the switch engine about to enter in a southerly direction on the northbound main line, there was nothing to indicate that any member of its crew would attempt to dismount between the two lines; and Driggers suddenly struck the side of the engine behind \n\n[279 U.S. 787, 792]\n\u00a0\n the pilot, in a position where he was not and could not have been seen by the engineer, and when it was impossible to stop the train.\n Under these circumstances, it is clear that Driggers, by his own negligence, as the sole and direct cause of the accident, brought on his own death, and that there is no ground upon which the liability of the Railroad Company may be predicated. Compare Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Davis, supra, page 39 of 279 U. S. (49 S. Ct. 210, 73 L.

Ct. 520. The \n\n[279 U.S. 781, 783]\n\u00a0\n appellants and appellees are the same here as they were on that appeal. The former are called the east side roads, and the appellee carriers are called the west side roads. The western termini of the appellants are at East St. Louis, and the eastern termini of the appellee carriers are at St. Louis. For many years the east side roads and the west side roads have exchanged traffic by means of the facilities of the Terminal Railroad Association. United States v. Terminal R. Ass'n, \n224 \nU.S. 383\n, 32 S. Ct. 507; Ex parte United States, \n226 \nU.S. 420\n, 33 S. Ct. 170; United States v. Terminal R. Ass'n, \n236 \nU.S. 194\n, 35 S. Ct. 408; Terminal R. R. Ass'n v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 17\n, 45 S. Ct. 5.\n The west side roads, in order to meet the competition of other rail carriers west of the river whose lines reached East St. Louis, made the same rates to both cities, and absorbed and bore the cost of transferring all freight across the river. On most of the traffic the east side roads made the same rates to both cities; but, on through traffic moving on combination rates through both points, their rates applied only to East St. Louis.\n After the decision of this court in Terminal R. R. Ass'n v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 17\n, 45 S. Ct. 5, the west side roads made complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission and secured its order requiring the east side roads to absorb the charges for transfer across the river on all west-bound through traffic moving on combination rates which were the same on St. Louis as on East St. Louis. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 113 I. C. C. 681. The east side roads brought this suit against the United States to set aside the order; the Commission and west side roads intervened. The court, consisting of three judges, dismissed the suit for want of equity. This court reversed the decree, and by its mandate directed that such further proceedings be had in the case, in conformity with the opinion and decree, as according to right and justice and the laws of the United States ought to be had.\n The mandate having been filed in the District Court, the appellants applied for a decree in conformity with it. \n\n[279 U.S. 781, 784]\n\u00a0\n They averred that, by reason of the erroneous dismissal of the suit, they had been compelled, up to the time our decree of reversal went into effect, to comply with the order of the Commission from its effective date, December 11, 1926, and had paid the transfer charges covered by the order. They prayed that the decree require the west side roads severally to restore to the respective east side roads the amounts which, because of the erroneous decree of dismissal, they had borne and paid, and that the case be referred to a master to ascertain the amounts.\n After hearing, the District Court, as before consisting of three judges, vacated its earlier decree and set aside the order of the Commission. The court found that appellants had complied with the order of the Commission as alleged, retained jurisdiction of the case, and later entered its final decree denying appellants' application for restitution and for reference to a master. This appeal was taken from such denial.\n The west side roads move to dismiss on the ground that the part of the decree complained of is not reviewable here on this appeal.\n The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 219,1 provides that no decree setting aside any order of the Commission shall be granted by any District Court unless the case shall be heard and determined by three judges. And the act gives aggrieved parties the right to appeal to this court from a final decree in any suit brought to set aside such orders. There is no question as to the \n\n[279 U.S. 781, 785]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of this court on the first appeal or as to the validity of its mandate. The present controversy concerns the construction and effect to be given to the mandate.\n Appellants' application for restitution was in effect an equity proceeding resulting in a final decree. Perkins v. Fourniquet, 14 How. 328, 330. When a lower federal court refuses to give effect to or misconstrues our mandate, its action may be controlled by this court, either upon a new appeal or by writ of mandamus. In re Potts, \n166 \nU.S. 263, 265\n, 17 S. Ct. 520; In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., \n160 \nU.S. 247, 255\n, 16 S. Ct. 291, and cases cited. It is well understood that this court has power to do all that is necessary to give effect of its judgments. The act authorizes this appeal.\n Moreover the proceeding below out of which the denial of restitution arose is incidental to and in effect a part of the main suit. Under the act a court of three judges was required for the entry of the decree on the mandate. Ex parte United States, supra, 424 (33 S. Ct. 170); Ex parte Metropolitan Water Co., \n220 \nU.S. 539, 544\n, 31 S. Ct. 600. The jurisdiction of the court so constituted necessarily includes power to make all orders required to carry on such suits and to enforce the rights and obligations of the parties that arise in the litigation. This appeal rests on the same foundation as did the first. Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 142\n, 39 S. Ct. 237.\n The east side roads are entitled to restitution. The order should have been set aside in the first instance. As a result of the erroneous refusal of the court, the burden of the transfer charges in question was shifted from the \n\n[279 U.S. 781, 786]\n\u00a0\n west side roads to the east side roads and was by them borne until the order was set aside on the reversal of the decree dismissing the bill. All payments made by appellants in compliance with the invalid order inured to the benefit of the west side roads just as if made directly to them.\n The right to recover what one has lost by the enforcement of a judgment subsequently reversed is well established. And, while the subject of the controversy and the parties are before the court, it has jurisdiction to enforce restitution and so far as possible to correct what has been wrongfully done. Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 \nU.S. 216, 219\n, 11 S. Ct. 523; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., supra, 145 (39 S. Ct. 237); Ex parte Lincoln Gas Co., \n256 \nU.S. 512, 516\n, 41 S. Ct. 558. When the erroneous decree was reversed and the invalid order was set aside, the law raised an obligation against each of the west side roads to make restitution of the payments made by the east side roads in compliance with the order. And thereupon each of the east side roads became entitled to have the amounts so paid by it together with interest thereon from the dates of such payments at the rate established by the law of the state in which such sums were paid.\n Before the reversal of the erroneous decree, there was transferred across the river a very great number of shipments covered by the order. The transfer charge on each constitutes a claim in favor of an east side road and against a west side road. If each claim is treated as a separate cause of action enforceable only at law, the number of suits and the burden of maintaining them would be so enormous that the relegation of the east side roads to that remedy would be a virtual denial of justice. It was the duty of the court to retain jurisdiction of the case, enter a decree that appellants are entitled to restitution, \n\n[279 U.S. 781, 787]\n\u00a0\n and refer the case to a master as prayed in appellants' motion. Ex parte Lincoln Gas Co., supra, 517 (41 S. Ct. 558).\n The lower court entered its decree dismissing the suit and, after reversal here, denied restitution without opinion, statement of reasons, or citation of authority. The questions were important, and the amounts involved were large. The judges should have given the reasons on which they rested their decisions. Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 222; Lawrence v. St. L.-S. F. R. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 588, 596\n, 47 S. Ct. 720; Arkansas Commission v. Chicago, etc., R.

CUNNINGHAM(1929)\nNo. 647\nArgued: April 23, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 597, 599]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George W. Wickersham, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 597, 604]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ruby R. Vale, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 597, 609]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions here presented for determination grow out of an inquiry instituted by the United States Senate in respect of the validity of the election of a United States Senator from Pennsylvania in November, 1926. The inquiry began before the election, immediately after the conclusion of the primaries, by the adoption of a resolution appointing a special committee to investigate expenditures, promises, etc., made to influence the nomination of any person as a candidate or promote the election of any person as a member of the Senate at the general election to be held in November, 1926\n\n\n After the Pennsylvania primaries, Cunningham was subpoenaed and appeared before this committee. Among other things, he testified that he was a member of an organization which supported William. S. Vare for Senator at the primary election; that he had given to the chairman of the organization $50,000 in two installments of $25,000 each prior to the holding of the primaries. He had been clerk of a court for 21 years and was then receiving a salary of $8,000 a year. He paid the money to the chairman in cash, but refused to say where he obtained it, except that he had not drawn it from a bank. He would not say how long the money had been in his possession; said he had never inherited any, but declined to answer whether he had made money in speculation. In short, he declined to give any information in respect of the sources of the money, insisting that it was his own, and the question where he had obtained it was a personal matter. He further said that he had learned the trick from a former Senator of 'saving money and putting it away and keeping it under cover'; that this Senator 'was a past master in not letting his right hand know what his left hand done, \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 610]\n\u00a0\n and he dealt absolutely in cash. The 'long green' was the issue.'\n Mr. Vare was nominated and elected at the succeeding November election. The special committee thereafter submitted a partial report in respect of Cunningham's refusal to testify. In January, 1927, Vare's election having been contested by William B. Wilson upon the ground of fraud and unlawful practices in connection with the nomination and election, the Senate adopted a resolution further authorizing the special committee to take possession of ballot boxes, tally sheets, etc., and to preserve evidence in respect of the charges made by Wilson. In February, 1927, Cunningham was recalled, and, questions previously put to him having been repeated, he again refused to give the information called for, as he had done at the first hearing.\n At the opening of Congress in December, 1927, the Senate adopted an additional resolution, reciting among other things, that there were numerous instances of fraud and corruption in behalf of Vare's candidacy, and that there had been expended in his behalf at the primary election a sum exceeding $785,000. Expenditure of such a large sum of money was declared to be contrary to sound public policy, and the special committee was directed to inquire into the claim of Vare to a seat in the Senate, to take evidence in respect thereto, and report to the Senate; in the meantime, it was resolved, Vare should be denied a seat in the Senate. By a subsequent resolution, the committee on privileges and elections was directed to hear and determine the contest between Vare and Wilson.\n The special committee, in March, 1928, reported its proceedings, including testimony given by Cunningham, recited his refusal to give information in response to questions, as hereinbefore set forth, and recommended that he be adjudged in contempt of the committee and of the Senate. The Senate, however, did not adopt the recom- \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 611]\n\u00a0\n mendation of the committee, but, instead, passed a resolution reciting Cunningham's contumacy and instructing the President to issue his warrant commanding the sergeant-at-arms or his deputy to take the body of Cunningham into custody, and to bring him before the bar of the Senate, 'then and there or elsewhere, as it may direct, to answer such questions pertinent to the matter under inquiry as the Senate, through its said committee, or the President of the Senate, may propound, and to keep the said Thomas W. Cunningham in custody to await further order of the Senate.' The warrant was issued and executed, and thereupon Cunningham brought a habeas corpus proceeding in the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n In his petition for the writ of habeas corpus, Cunningham averred that he was arrested under the warrant by reason of an alleged contempt, and that, by reason of his refusal to disclose his private and individual affairs to the special committee, the Senate had illegally and without authority adjudged him to be in contempt and had issued its warrant accordingly. A return was made to the writ, denying that the Senate had adjudged Cunningham in contempt and, in substance, averring that the warrant by which he was held simply required that he be brought to the bar of the Senate to answer questions pertaining to the matter under inquiry, etc.\n The District Court, to which the return was made, after a hearing and consideration of written briefs and oral arguments, entered an order discharging the writ and remanding Cunningham to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms. A written opinion was handed down by Judge Dickinson, sustaining the power of the Senate to compel the attendance of witnesses under the circumstances above set forth, and holding that the Senate had not proceeded against Cunningham for a contempt, but by its resolution had required his arrest and production at the bar of the \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 612]\n\u00a0\n Senate, simply to answer questions pertinent to the matter under inquiry. United States ex rel. Cunningham v. Barry, 25 F.(2d) 733.\n Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, holding that the arrest was in reality one for contempt, but, if it should be regarded as an arrest to procure Cunningham's attendance as a witness, it was void, because a subpoena to attend at the bar of the Senate had not previously been served upon him, and that this was a necessary prerequisite to the issue of an attachment. Treating the proceeding as one for contempt, that court held that the information sought to be elicited, and which Cunningham refused to give, was not pertinent to the inquiry authorized to be made by the committee, and that Cunningham was justified in declining to answer the questions in respect thereof. Circuit Judge Woolley dissented, substantially adopting the view of the District Court. 29 F.(2d) 817.\n The correct interpretation of the Senate's action is that given by the District Judge and by Judge Woolley. It is true the special committee, in its report to the Senate, recited Cunningham's contumacy and recommended that he be adjudged in contempt, but the resolution passed by the Senate makes it entirely plain that this recommendation of the committee was not followed. The Senate resolution, after a recital of Cunningham's refusal to answer certain questions, directs that he be attached and brought before the bar of the Senate, not to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, but 'to answer such questions pertinent to the matter under inquiry as the Senate through its said committee or the President of the Senate may propound. ...' We must accept this unequivocal language as expressing the purpose of the Senate to elicit testimony in response to questions to be propounded at the bar of the Senate, and the question whether the information sought to be elicited \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 613]\n\u00a0\n from Cunningham by the committee was pertinent to the inquiry which the committee had been directed to make may be put aside as immaterial.\n It results that the following are the sole questions here for determination: (1) Whether the Senate was engaged in an inquiry which it had constitutional power to make; (2) if so, whether that body had power to bring Cuningham to its bar as a witness by means of a warrant of arrest; and (3) whether, as a necessary prerequisite to the issue of such warrant of arrest, a subpoena should first have been served and disobeyed.\n First. Generally, the Senate is a legislative body, exercising in connection with the House only the power to make laws. But it has had conferred upon it by the Constitution certain powers, which are not legislative, but judicial, in character. Among these is the power to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members. Article 1,  5, cl. 1. 'That power carries with it authority to take such steps as may be appropriate and necessary to secure information upon which to decide concerning elections.' Reed v. County Commissioners, \n277 \nU.S. 376, 388\n, 48 S. Ct. 531. Exercise of the power necessarily involves the ascertainment of facts, the attendance of witnesses, the examination of such witnesses, with the power to compel them to answer pertinent questions, to determine the facts and apply the appropriate rules of law, and, finally, to render a judgment which is beyond the authority of any other tribunal to review. In exercising this power, the Senate may, of course, devolve upon a committee of its members the authority to investigate and report; and this is the general, if not the uniform, practice. When evidence is taken by a committee, the pertinency of questions propounded must be determined by reference to the scope of the authority vested in the committee by the Senate. But undoubtedly the Senate, if it so de- \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 614]\n\u00a0\n termine, may in whole or in part dispense with the services of a committee and itself take testimony, and, after conferring authority upon its committee, the Senate, for any reason satisfactory to it and at any stage of the proceeding, may resume charge of the inquiry and conduct it to a conclusion, or to such extent as it may see fit. In that event, the limitations put upon the committee obviously do not control the Senate; but that body may deal with the matter, without regard to these limitations, subject only to the restraints imposed by or found in the implications of the Constitution. We cannot assume, in advance of Cunningham's interrogation at the bar of the Senate, that these restraints will not faithfully be observed. It sufficiently appears from the foregoing that the inquiry in which the Senate was engaged, and in respect of which it required the arrest and production of Cunningham, was within its constitutional authority.\n It is said, however, that the power conferred upon the Senate is to Judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its 'members,' and, since the Senate had refused to admit Vare to a seat in the Senate, or permit him to take the oath of office, that he was not a member. It is enough to say of this that upon the face of the returns he had been elected, and had received a certificate from the Governor of the state to that effect. Upon these returns and with this certificate, he presented himself to the Senate, claiming all the rights of membership. Thereby the jurisdiction of the Senate to determine the rightfulness of the claim was invoked and its power to adjudicate such right immediately attached by virtue of section 5 of article 1 of the Constitution. Whether, pending this adjudication, the credentials should be accepted, the oath administered, and the full right accorded to participate in the business of the Senate, was a matter within the discretion of the Senate. This has been the practical construction of the \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 615]\n\u00a0\n power by both houses of Congress;1 and we perceive no reason why we should reach a different conclusion. When a candidate is elected to either house, he of course is elected a member of the body; and when that body determines, upon presentation of his credentials, without first giving him his seat, that the election is void, there would seem to be no real substance in a claim that the election of a 'member' has not been adjudged. To hold otherwise would be to interpret the word 'member' with a strictness in no way required by the obvious purpose of the constitutional provision, or necessary to its effective enforcement in accordance with such purpose, which, so far as the present case is concerned, was to vest the Senate with authority to exclude persons asserting membership, who either had not been elected or, what amounts to the same thing, had been elected by resort to fraud, bribery, corruption, or other sinister methods having the effect of vitiating the election.\n Nor is there merit in the suggestion that the effect of the refusal of the Senate to seat Vare pending investigation was to deprive the state of its equal representation in the Senate. The equal representation clause is found in article 5, which authorizes and regulates amendments to the Constitution, 'provided, ... that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.' This constitutes a limitation upon the power \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 616]\n\u00a0\n of amendment, and has nothing to do with a situation such as the one here presented. The temporary deprivation of equal representation which results from the refusal of the Senate to seat a member pending inquiry as to his election or qualifications is the necessary consequence of the exercise of a constitutional power, and no more deprives the state of its 'equal suffrage' in the constitutional sense than would a vote of the Senate vacating the seat of a sitting member or a vote of expulsion.\n Second. In exercising the power to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members, the Senate acts as a judicial tribunal, and the authority to require the attendance of witnesses is a necessary incident of the power to adjudge, in no wise inferior under like circumstances to that exercised by a court of justice. That this includes the power in some cases to issue a warrant of arrest to compel such attendance, as was done here, does not admit of doubt. McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 160\n, 180 S., 47 S. Ct. 319, 50 A. L. R. 1. That case dealt with the power of the Senate thus to compel a witness to appear to give testimony necessary to enable that body efficiently to exercise a legislative function; but the principle is equally, if not a fortiori, applicable where the Senate is exercising a judicial function.\n Third. The real question is not whether the Senate had power to issue the warrant of arrest, but whether it could do so under the circumstances disclosed by the record. The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is that, as a necessary prerequisite to the issue of a warrant of arrest, a subpoena first should have been issued, served, and disobeyed. And undoubtedly the courts recognize this as the practice generally to be followed. But undoubtedly, also, a court has power in the exercise of a sound discretion to issue a warrant of arrest without a previous subpoena, when there is good reason to believe that otherwise the witness will not be forthcoming. A statute of the United \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 617]\n\u00a0\n States (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  659 (28 USCA  659)) provides that any federal judge, on application of the district attorney, and being satisfied by proof that any person is a competent and necessary witness in a criminal proceeding in which the United States is a party or interested, may have such person brought before him by a warrant of arrest, to give recognizance, and that such person may be confined until removed for the purpose of giving his testimony, or until he gives the recognizance required by said judge. The constitutionality of this statute apparently has never been doubted. Similar statutes exist in many of the states and have been enforced without question.\n United States v. Lloyd, 4 Blatchf. 427, Fed. Cas. No. 15,614, was a case arising under the federal statute. The validity of the statute was not doubted, although the witness was held under peculiar conditions of severity, because of which the court allowed him to be discharged upon his own recognizance in the sum of $1,000.\n In State of Minnesota ex rel. v. Grace, 18 Minn. 398 (Gil. 359), a similar statute was upheld and applied in the case of a material witness where it was claimed that there was good reason to believe that he would leave the state before the trial and not return to be present at the time of such trial. The court, using the words of Lord Ellenborough in Benett v. Watson, 3 Maule & Selwyn, 1, said (page 402): 'The law intends that the witness shall be forthcoming at all events, and it is a lenient mode which it provides to permit him to go at large upon his own recognizance. However this is only one mode of accomplishing the end, which is his due appearance.' The witness, however, was discharged because of an entire absence of proof of any intention on his part not to appear and testify.\n The comment of the court in Crosby v. Potts, 8 Ga. App. 463, 468, 69 S. E. 582, 584, is peculiarly apposite:\n'It is a hardship upon one whose only connection with a case is that he happens to know some material fact in \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 618]\n\u00a0\n relation thereto that he should be taken into control by the court and held in the custody of the jailer unless he gives bond (which, from poverty, he may be unable to give), conditioned that he will appear and testify; but the exigencies of particular instances do often require just such stringent methods in order to compel the performance of the duty of the witness's appearing and testifying. There are many cases in which an ordinary subpoena would prove inadequate to secure the presence of the witness at the trial. The danger of punishment for contempt on account of a refusal to appear is sometimes too slight to deter the witness from absenting himself; especially is this true where there are but few ties to hold the witness in the jurisdiction where the trial is to be held, and there are reasons why he desires not to testify; for when once he has crossed the state line, he is beyond the grasp of any of the court's processes to bring him to the trial or to punish him for his refusal to answer to a subpoena. We conclude, therefore, that since the law manifestly intends that the courts shall have adequate power to compel the performance of the respective duties falling on those connected in any wise with the case, it may, where the exigencies so require, cause a witness to be held in custody, and in jail if need be, unless he gives reasonable bail for his appearance at the trial.'\n\n See, also, Ex parte Sheppard, 43 Tex. Cr. R. 372, 66 S. W. 304; Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence,  3622.\n The rule is stated by Wharton, 1 Law of Evidence,  385, that where suspicions exist that a witness may disappear, or be spiriated away, before trial, in criminal cases, and when allowed by statute in civil cases, he may be held to bail to appear at the trial and may be committed on failure to furnish it, and that such imprisonment does not violate the sanctions of the federal or state Constitutions.\n The validity of acts of Congress authorizing courts to exercise the power in question thus seems to be established. \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 619]\n\u00a0\n The Senate, having sole authority under the Constitution to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its members, may exercise in its own right the incidental power of compelling the attendance of witnesses without the aid of a statute. Compare Reed v. County Commissioners, supra, page 388 of 277 U. S. (48 S. Ct. 531). The following appears from the report of the committee to the Senate upon which the action here complained of was taken. 'A subpoena was issued for his appearance early in June. A diligent search failed to locate him. Finally Representative Golder of the Fourth District of Pennsylvania communicated with the committee, stating that Cunningham would accept service. His whereabouts was disclosed and he was served.' Upon examination by the committee, he repeatedly refused to answer questions which the committee deemed relevant and of great importance, not upon the ground that the answers would tend to incriminate him, but that they involved personal matters. These questions have already been recited, and it is impossible for us to say that the information sought and refused would not reflect light upon the validity of Vare's election.\n It is not necessary to determine whether the information sought was pertinent to the inquiry before the committee, the scope of which was fixed by the provisions of the Senate resolution. But it might well have been pertinent in an inquiry conducted by the Senate itself, exercising the full, original, and unqualified power conferred by the Constitution. If the Senate thought so, and, from the facts before it reasonably believing that this or other important evidence otherwise might be lost, issued its warrant of arrest, it is not for the court to say that in doing so the Senate abused its discretion. The presumption in favor of regularity, which applies to the proceedings of courts, cannot be denied to the proceedings of the houses of Congress, when acting upon matters within their constitutional authority. It fairly may be assumed that the Senate will deal with the witness in accordance \n\n[279 U.S. 597, 620]\n\u00a0\n with well-settled rules and discharge him from custody upon proper assurance, by recognizance or otherwise, that he will appear for interrogation when required. This is all he could properly demand of a court under similar circumstances.\n Here the question under consideration concerns the exercise by the Senate of an indubitable power; and if judicial interference can be successfully invoked, i can only be upon a clear showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of the power as will constitute a denial of due process of law. That condition we are unable to find in the present case.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Among the typical cases in the House, where that body refused to seat members in advance of investigation, although presenting credentials unimpeachable in form, was that of Roberts, in the Fifty-Sixth Congress, where it was so decided after full debate by a vote of 268 to 50.

Ellery Edwards, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles S. Rosenschein, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1927, the respondents brought an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in which they obtained a judgment that the defendant, the petitioner, was trustee ex maleficio for Oppenheimer of an invention and letters patent issued to the defendant; that the defendant deliver to the plaintiffs an assignment of the letters patent and give up instruments similar to the invention; that he be enjoined from using, manufacturing, selling, etc., such instruments, and from transferring any rights under the patent, and that he pay costs. The judg- \n\n[279 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n ment was based on the facts alleged and found that Oppenheimer having made the invention in question employed Becher as a machinist to construct the invented machine and improvements made by Oppenheimer from time to time, and that Becher agreed to keep secret and confidential the information thus obtained and not to use it for the benefit of himself or of any other than Oppenheimer. It was found further, that while engaged in making instruments for Oppenheimer and after having learned from him all the facts, Becher without the knowledge of the plaintiffs and in violation of his agreement and of the confidential relation existing, applied for and obtained a patent of which Oppenheimer knew nothing until after it had been issued, and while Becher was still making for him the Oppenheimer machine.\n The judgment was entered on July 5, 1928, and at about the same time the present suit was brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which the parties are reversed. Becher sets up his patent, alleges infringement of it and prays an injunction. He also states the earlier proceedings in the State Court, and, although not in very distinct terms, seems to deny the jurisdiction of that Court inasmuch as the allegations of Oppenheimer if sustained, as they were, would show the Becher patent to be invalid; a question, it is said, for the Patent Office and the Court of the United States alone. An injunction was asked restraining the defendants from further prosecuting their suit in the State Court. A preliminary injunction was denied by the District Court and on appeal the decree was affirmed, and the appellant's counsel consenting if the Court decided that the State Court had jurisdiction, the bill was dismissed. 29 F.(2d) 31.\n It is not denied that the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States is exclusive in the case of suits arising under the patent laws, but it was held below that the \n\n[279 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n suit in the State Court did not arise under those laws. It is plain that that suit had for its cause of action the breach of a contract or wrongful disregard of confidential relations, both matters independent of the patent law, and that the subject matter of Oppenheimer's claim was an undisclosed invention which did not need a patent to protect it from disclosure by breach of trust. Irving Iron Works v. Kerlow Steel Flooring Co., 96 N. J. Eq. 702, 126 A. 291; Du Pont de Nemours Powder Co. v. Masland, \n244 \nU.S. 100\n, 37 S. Ct. 575. Oppenheimer's right was independent of and prior to any arising out of the patent law, and it seems a strange suggestion that the assertion of that right can be removed from the cognizance of the tribunals established to protect it by its opponent going into the patent office for a later title. It is said that to establish Oppenheimer's claim is to invalidate Becher's patent. But, even if mistakenly, the attempt was not to invalidate that patent but to get an assignment of it, and an assignment was decreed. Suits against one who has received a patent of land to make him a trustee for the plaintiff on the ground of some paramount equity are well known. Again, even if the logical conclusion from the establishing of Oppenheimer's claim is that Becher's patent is void, that is not the effect of the judgment. Establishing a fact and giving a specific effect to it by judgment are quite distinct. A judgment in rem binds all the world, but the facts on which it necessarily proceeds are not established against all the world, Manson v. Williams, \n213 \nU.S. 453, 455\n, 29 S. Ct. 519, and conversely establishing the facts is not equivalent to a judgment in rem.\n That decrees validating or invalidating patents belong to the Courts of the United States does not give sacrosanctity to facts that may be conclusive upon the question in issue. A fact is not prevented from being proved in any case in which it is material, by the suggestion that \n\n[279 U.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n if it is true an important patent is void-and although there is language here and there that seems to suggest it we can see no ground for giving less effect to proof of such a fact than to any other. A party may go into a suit estopped as to a vital fact by a covenant. We see no sufficient reason for denying that he may be equally estopped by a judgment. See Pratt v.

The 1926 amendment to the Constitution and the statutes of that state lay upon such carriers a tax of 5 per cent. of their gross receipts in lieu of all other taxes, while other freight carriers, common and private, by motor vehicles, are subjected to different and, it is alleged, less burdensome taxation. Const. Cal. art. 13,  15; Act March 5, 1927, chapter 19, Stats. Cal. 1927\n\n\n By this proceeding, instituted July 21, 1928, appellants ask that the constitutional amendment and that statute \n\n[280 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n which undertake to lay such tax upon them be declared discriminatory and in conflict with section 1, of the Fourteenth Amendment; also that an injunction issue against the state controller forbidding him from attempting to enforce payment.\n Upon motion, without written opinion, the District Court-three judges sitting-dismissed the bill. The cause is here by direct appeal, and the only matter for our determination is the validity of the challenged classification.\n The power of a state in respect of classification has often been declared by opinions here. We are unable to say that there was no reasonable basis for the one under consideration; the court below reached the proper result, and its decree must be affirmed.\n Appellants voluntarily assumed the position of common carriers operating between fixed termini and enjoy all consequent benefits. That a marked distinction exists between common and private carriers by auto vehicles appears from Frost v. Railroad Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457, and Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105. Sufficient reasons for placing common carriers, operating as appellants do, in a special class, are pointed out by Raymond v. Holm, 165 Minn. 215, 206 N. W. 166 (Dec. 4, 1925); State v.

Michigan Public Utilities Commission (D. C.) 294 F. 703. Their use of the highways probably will be regular and frequent, and therefore unusually destructive therto; also it will expose the public to dangers exceeding those consequent upon the occasional movements of other carriers.\n Although relied upon by counsel and said to be almost identical with the case at bar, Quaker City Cab Co. v.

UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 31\nArgued: November 20, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nathan A. Smyth, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Botany Worsted Mills, a New Jersey corporation engaged in the manufacture of woolen and worsted fabrics, made a return of its net income for the taxable year 1917 under the Revenue Act of 19161 and the War Revenue Act of 1917. 2 By section 12(a) of the Revenue Act it was provided that in ascertaining the net income of a corporation organized in the United States, there should be deducted from its gross income all 'the ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties.' Under this provision the Mills deducted amounts aggregating $1,565,739.39 paid as compensation to the members of its board of directors, in addition to salaries of $9,000 each. It paid an income tax computed in accordance with this return. Thereafter, in 1920, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an additional income tax against it. Of this, $450,994.06 was attributable to his disallowance of $783,656.06 of the deduction claimed as compensation paid to the directors, on the ground that the total amount paid as compensation was unreasonable and the remainder of the deduction as allowed represented fair and reasonable compensation. The Mills after paying the additional tax filed a claim for refund of this $450,994.06. The claim was disallowed; and the Mills thereafter, in September, 1924, by a petition in the Court of Claims sought to recover this sum from the United States, with \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n interest-alleging that the disallowance of part of the compensation paid the directors was illegal. \n3\n After a hearing on the merits the court, upon its findings of fact, dismissed the petition upon the ground that the additional tax was imposed under an agreement of settlement which prevented a recovery. 63 Ct. Cl. 405. And this writ of certiorari was granted.\n The first question presented is whether the Mills is precluded from recovering the amount claimed by reason of a settlement.\n Section 3229 of the Revised Statutes4 provides that: 'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, may compromise any civil or criminal case arising under the internal-revenue laws instead of commencing suit thereon; and with the advice and consent of the said Secretary and the recommendation of the Attorney-General, he may compromise any such case after a suit thereon has been commenced. Whenever a compromise is made in any case there shall be placed on file in the office of the Commissioner the opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue, ... with his reasons therefor, with a statement of \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n the amount of tax assessed, ... and the amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Government did not claim that there had been a compromise under this statute, but contended in the Court of Claims that, irrespective thereof, an agreement of settlement had been entered into between the Mills and the Commissioner under which the Mills had accepted the partial disallowance as to the compensation paid the directors, and had also received concessions as to other disputed items the benefit of which it still enjoyed, and was therefore estopped from seeking a recovery.\n As to this matter the findings of fact show that after the Mills had paid the amount of the tax shown by its original return an investigation of its books disclosed to the Commissioner the necessity of making an additional assessment, to be determined by the settlement of questions relating to the compensation (or, as it was termed, bonus) paid to the directors, depreciation charged off on its books, and reserves charged to expenses. After much correspondence and numerous conferences extending over several months between the attorney and assistant treasurer of the Mills and the chief of the special audit section of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and others of his official associates, a compromise was agreed to as to all the differences, by which the amount to be allowed as reasonable compensation to the directors and as depreciation were agreed upon, and the claim as to reserves was allowed. Thereupon the Mills prepared and filed an amended return based upon the figures agreed upon in the conferences, with documentary evidence which it had \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n agreed to furnish; and the additional assessment was made in accordance with this return. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The court, in sustaining the Government's contention, said: 'With the payment of the tax under the circumstances surrounding this case the agreement, which is mentioned in the record as a 'gentleman's agreement,' became in legal effect an executed contract of settlement;' and that, as the Mills was seeking to recover on account of the particular item which it regarded as unfavorable to its interests, and at the same time hold to the advantage derived from the settlement of other items in dispute involved in the same general settlement, it should not be allowed a recovery.\n The Mills contends that the Commissioner had not been given, at the time in question, any authority, either in express terms or by implication, to compromise tax cases except as provided in section 3229; that this statute in granting such authority under specific limitations as to the method to be pursued, negatived his authority to effect a valid and binding agreement in any other way; that as the Government could not have been estopped by the unauthorized transactions of its officials, the Mills likewise could not be estopped thereby; and further, that the findings are insufficient to establish an estoppel.\n The Government does not here challenge any of these contentions. In the brief for the United States filed in this Court the Solicitor General states that the question whether such an informal adjustment of taxes as was made in this case is binding on the taxpayer, is submitted for decision in deference to the opinion of the Court of Claims and the importance of the question-but no argument is made in support of the Government's previous contention that the Mills was estopped from questioning \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n the settlement. And, on the contrary, it is stated that-'Before and since the date of the alleged settlement in this case Congress has evidently proceeded on the theory that no adjustment of a tax controversy between representatives of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and a taxpayer is binding unless made with the formalities and with the approval of the officials prescribed by statute. The authority of officers of the United States to compromise claims on behalf of or against the United States is strictly limited. ... The statutes which authorize conclusive agreements and settlements to be made in particular ways and with the approval of designated officers raise the inference that adjustments or settlements made in other ways are not binding.' And further, that 'No ground for the United States to claim estoppel is disclosed in the findings.'\n Independently of these concessions, we are of the opinion that the informal settlement made in this case did not constitute a binding agreement. Section 3229 authorizes the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compromise tax claims before suit, with the advice and consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, and requires that an opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue setting forth the compromise be filed in the Commissioner's office. Here the attempted settlement was made by subordinate officials in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. And although it may have been ratified by the Commissioner in making the additional assessment based thereon, it does not appear that it was assented to by the Secretary, or that the opinion of the Solicitor was filed in the Commissioner's office.\n We think that Congress intended by the statute to prescribe the exclusive method by which tax cases could be compromised, requiring therefor the concurrence of the Commissioner and the Secretary, and prescribing the formality with which, as a matter of public concern, it should be attested in the files of the Commissioner's office; \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n and did not intend to intrust the final settlement of such matters to the informal action of subordinate officials in the Bureau. When a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes the negative of any other mode. Raleigh & G. Railroad Co. v. Reid, 13 Wall. 269, 270; Scott v. Ford, 52 Or. 288, 296, 97 P. 99.\n It is plain that no compromise is authorized by this statute which is not assented to by the Secretary of the Treasury. Leach v. Nichols (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 275, 277. For this reason, if for no other, the informal agreement made in this case did not constitute a settlement which in itself was binding upon the Government or the Mills. And, without determining whether such an agreement, though not binding in itself, may when executed become, under some circumstances, binding on the parties by estoppel, it suffices to say that here the findings disclose no adequate ground for any claim of estoppel by the United States.\n We therefore conclude that the Mills was not precluded by the settlement from recovering any portion of the tax to which it may otherwise have been entitled.\n This brings us to the question whether on the findings of fact the Mills is entitled to recover the portion of the additional tax attributable to the disallowance of $783,656.06 of the amount paid to the directors which it had claimed as a deduction. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Under section 12(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 the Mills was not entitled to this deduction unless the amount paid constituted a part of its 'ordinary and necessary expenses' in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties. And in this suit the burden of establish- \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n ing that fact rested upon it, in order to show that it was entitled to the deduction which the Commissioner had disallowed, and that the additional tax was to that extent illegally assessed. The Court of Claims, however, made no finding that the amount disallowed by the Commissioner constituted a part of the ordinary and necessary expenses of the Mills. The findings are silent as to this ultimate fact-essential to a recovery by the Mills- and only show certain circumstantial facts relating to the payment made to the board of directors.\n Where the Court of Claims does not make a finding upon the ultimate question of fact upon which the rights of the parties depend, but merely makes findings as to subsidiary circumstantial facts which bear upon it, such findings will not support a judgment unless the circumstantial facts as found are such that the ultimate fact follows from them as a necessary inference and may be held to result as a conclusion of law. See United States v. Pugh, \n99 U.S. 265\n, 269; Winton v. Amos, \n255 \nU.S. 373, 395\n, 41 S. Ct. 342.\n The findings show that for many years it has been the practice of many corporations engaged in the woolen manufacturing business to base the compensation of the directors and executive officers upon a percentage of profits. Upon the organization of the Mills in 1890 the stockholders adopted a by-law providing that at the close of the business year the net profits should be distributed by paying a dividend of 6 per cent. to stockholders and applying the balance remaining as follows: (a) Placing 5 per cent. in a reserve fund; (b) paying 25 per cent. 'as a bonus to the board of directors;' and (c) paying 70 per cent. as additional dividend to the stockholders. The stockholders amended this by-law in 1903 by increasing the bonus of the board of directors to 40 per cent.; in 1905, by providing, instead of a 'bonus,' that 'compensation' \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n equal to 40 per cent. should be 'paid to the board of directors for their services'; and in 1908, by reducing such compensation to 32 per cent. ( that is, 30.08 per cent. of the net profits). This by-law remained in force until after the taxable year 1917; and during the entire period 'compensation' was paid to the directors in accordance therewith. From the outset the determination of the total amount of profits and of the aggregate amount payable to the board of directors was made by the board itself; and it likewise determined the basis of the apportionment among the several directors of the aggregate amount payable to the board as a whole. No contract was made with any director as to what his compensation should be other than such as was implied from his election ans service as a member of the board in accordance with the by-law and the customary practices of the company, which each knew. At all times each director also held a position as an executive officer or manager of a department of the Mills.\n The gross assets of the Mills increased from.$1,114,149.63 in 1890 to $ 28,893,777.12 in 1917; and its net assets, including reserves, from $37, 136.35 to $10,999,862.48. Its net income increased from $784,334.44 in 1910 to $7,953,512.80 in 1917; and the amount paid the directors in pursuance of the by-law, increased, with some fluctuations, from $268,444. 19 in 1910, to $400,935.18 in 1915, $693,617.16 in 1916, and $1,565,739.39 in 1917.8 In 1917 there were ten members of the board, so that if the total amount had been apportioned ratably, each would have received $156, 573.93. And in that year each member of the board, in addition to the part of the aggregate in fact apportioned to him individually, also received a salary of $9,000. \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 292]\n\u00a0\n The findings do not show the nature or extent of the services rendered by the board of directors or its individual members, either as directors, executive officers or department managers-the amounts apportioned and paid to each director-the basis of apportionment, whether the nature and extent of their individual services, the amount of their stockholdings, or otherwise-the value of their services-or the reasonableness of the purported compensation.\n We do not find it necessary to determine here whether the amounts paid by a corporation to its officers as compensation for their services cannot be allowed as 'ordinary and necessary expenses' within the meaning of section 12(a), merely because, and to the extent that, as compensation, they are unreasonable in amount. \n9\n However this may be, it is clear that extraordinary, unusual and extravagant amounts paid by a corporation to its officers in the guise and form of compensation for their services, but having no substantial relation to the measure of their services and being utterly disproportioned to their value, are not in reality payment for services, and cannot be regarded as 'ordinary and necessary expenses' within the meaning of the section; and that such amounts do not become part of the 'ordinary and necessary expenses' merely because the payments are made in accordance with an agreement between the corporation and its officers. Even if binding upon the parties, such an agreement does not change the character of the purported compensation or constitute it, as against the Government, an ordinary and necessary expense. Compare 20 Treas. Dec., Int. Rev., 330; Jacobs & Davies v. Anderson (C. C. A.) 228 F. 505, 506; \n\n[278 U.S. 282, 293]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Philadelphia Knitting Mills Co. (C. C. A.) 273 F. 657, 658; and Becker Bros. v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 3, 6.\n In the light of this principle it is clear that the findings do not show, as a matter of necessary inference resulting as a conclusion of law, that the amount paid the directors in excess of the $782,083.33 allowed by the Commissioner, 10 constituted part of the ordinary and necessary expenses of the Mills. On the contrary, as this amount so greatly exceeded the amounts which, as a matter of common knowledge, are usually paid to directors for their attendance at meetings of the board and the discharge of their customary duties, and was much greater than the amounts that had been paid in prior years,11 and as there is no showing as to the amounts paid the individual directors, in addition to the salaries of $9,000 which each received-presumably for his services as an executive officer or department manager-or as to the nature, extent or value of their services, the findings raise a strong inference that the unusual and extraordinary amount paid to the directors was not in fact compensation for their services, but merely a distribution of a fixed percentage of the net profits that had no relation to the services rendered.\n Therefore, as the Mills has not sustained the burden of showing that the amount disallowed by the Commissioner was in fact part of its ordinary and necessary expenses, the judgment must, for this reason, be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES agrees with the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 39 Stat. 756, c. 463. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 40 Stat. 300, c. 63. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 3226 of the Revised Statutes had been previously amended by section 1318 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 314, c. 136 (26 USCA  156), so as to provide that no suit or proceeding should be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected until a claim for refund or credit had been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and further amended by section 1014(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, c. 234 (26 USCA  156), so as to provide that such suit or proceeding might be maintained, whether or not such tax had been paid under protest or duress.

MCCAUGHN(1929)\nNo. 27\nArgued: October 31, 1929Decided: November 25, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ira Jewell Williams, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Bromley.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 124, 130]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for mCcaughn.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 124, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case, pending in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that court has certified to this questions of law concerning which it asks instructions for the proper disposition of the cause. Judicial Code,  239, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925,  1 (28 USCA  346).\n Bromley, a resident of the United States, brought the present suit in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania (26 F.(2d) 380) to recover a tax alleged to have been illegally exacted, upon gifts made by him after the effective date of section 319 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 253, 313), \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 135]\n\u00a0\n as amended by section 324(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, (44 Stat. 9, 86 ( 26 USCA  1131 note)). This section imposes a graduated tax 'upon the transfer by a resident by gift' during the calendar year 'of any property wherever situated. ...' In computing the amount of the gift subject to the tax, section 321 (26 USCA  1133 note), in the case of a resident, exempts gifts aggregating $50,000, gifts to any one person which do not exceed $500, and certain gifts for religious, charitable, educational, scientific, and like purposes. The questions certified are:\n\n 1. \nAre the provisions of sections 319-324 of the Revenue Act of 1924, as amended by section 324 of the Revenue Act of 1926, when applied to transfers of property by gift inter vivos, made after the effective dates of the cited Revenue Acts and not made in contemplation of death, invalid, because they violate (a) the third clause of section 2 and (b) the fourth clause of section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution in that the tax they impose is a direct tax and has not been apportioned?\n\n 2. \nAre the cited provisions, when applied to transfers of property made in like circumstances, invalid because they violate (a) the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and (b) the first clause of section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution in that they impose a tax which is graduated and subject to exemptions and therefore lacks uniformity, and also deprive a person of his property without due process of law?\n\n 1. \nThe first question was mooted by counsel, but not decided in Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105, and Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353. The general power to 'lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises' conferred by article 1,  8, of the Constitution, and required by that section to be uniform throughout the United States, is limited by section 2 of the same article, which requires 'direct' taxes to be apportioned, and section 9, which provides that 'no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census' directed by the Constitution \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 136]\n\u00a0\n to be taken. As the present tax is not apportioned, it is forbidden, if direct.\n The meaning of the phrase 'direct taxes' and the historical background of the constitutional requirement for their apportionment have been so often and exhaustively considered by this court, Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S. Ct. 912; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 515\n, 19 S. Ct. 522, that no useful purpose would be served by renewing the discussion here. Whatever may be the precise line which sets off direct taxes from others, we need not now determine. While taxes levied upon or collected from persons because of their general ownership of property may be taken to be direct, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Turst Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S. Ct. 912, this court has consistently held, almost from the foundation of the government, that a tax imposed upon a particular use of property or the exercise of a single power over property incidental to ownership, is an excise which neet not be apportioned, and it is enough for present purposes that this tax is of the latter class. Hylton v. United States, supra; cf. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533; Thomas v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 24 S. Ct. 305; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Nicol v. Ames, supra; Patton v. Brady, \n184 \nU.S. 608\n, 22 S. Ct. 493; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Scholey v. Rew, 23 Wall. 331; Knowlton v. Moore, supra. See, also, Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Spreckels Sugar Refining Co. v. McClain, \n192 \nU.S. 397\n, 24 S. Ct. 376; Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399\n, 34 S. Ct. 136; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co ., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 183\n, 38 S. Ct. 467; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 36 S. Ct. 278.\n It is a tax laid only upon the exercise of a single one of those powers incident to ownership, the power to give the property owned to another. Under this statute all the other rights and powers which collectively constitute \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 137]\n\u00a0\n property or ownership may be fully enjoyed free of the tax. So far as the constitutional power to tax is concerned, it would be difficult to state any intelligible distinction, founded either in reason or upon practical considerations of weight, between a tax upon the exercise of the power to give property inter vivos and the disposition of it by legacy, upheld in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, the succession tax in Scholey v. Rew, supra, the tax upon the manufacture and sale of colored oleomargarine in McCray v. United States, supra, the tax upon sales of grain upon an exchange in Nicol v. Ames, supra, the tax upon sales of shares of stock in Thomas v. United States, supra, the tax upon the use of foreign built yachts in Billings v. United States, supra, the tax upon the use of carriages in Hylton v. United States, supra; compare Veazie Bank v. Fenno, supra, 545 of 8 Wall.; Thomas v. United States, supra, 370 of 192 U. S ., 24 S. Ct. 305.\n It is true that in each of these cases the tax was imposed upon the exercise of one of the numerous rights of property, but each is clearly distinguishable from a tax which falls upon the owner merely because he is owner, regardless of the use of disposition made of his property. See Billings v. United States, supra; cf. Pierce v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 290\n, 34 S. Ct. 427. The persistence of this distinction and the justification for it rest upon the historic fact that taxes of this type were not understood to be direct taxes when the Constitution was adopted and, as well, upon the reluctance of this court to enlarge by construction, limitations upon the sovereign power of taxation by article 1,  8, so vital to the maintenance of the national government. Nicol v. Ames, supra, 514, 515 of 173 U. S., 19, S. Ct. 522.\n It is said that, since property is the sum of all the rights and powers incident to ownership, 173 U. S., 19 S. Ct. 522. of any of them is upheld, the distinction between direct and other classes of taxes may be wiped out, since the property itself may likewise be taxed by resort to the expedient of levying numerous taxes upon its \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 138]\n\u00a0\n uses; that one of the uses of property is to keep it, and that a tax upon the possession or keeping of property is no different from a tax on the property itself. Even if we assume that a tax levied upon all the uses to which property may be put, or upon the exercise of a single power indispensable to the enjoyment of all others over it, would be in effect a tax upon property, see Dawson v. Kentucky Distilling & Warehouse Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288\n, 41 S. Ct. 272, and hence a direct tax requiring apportionment, that is not the case before us.\n The power to give cannot be said to be a more important incident of property than the power to use, the exercise of which was taxed in Billings v. United States, and, even though differences in degree may be carried to a point where they produce distinctions in kind, the present levy falls so far short of taxing generally the uses of property that it cannot be likened to the taxes on property itself which have been recognized as direct. It falls, rather, into that category of imposts or excises which, since they apply only to a limited exercise of property rights, have been deemed to be indirect and so valid, although not apportioned.\n\n 2. \nThe uniformity of taxation throughout the United States enjoined by article 1,  8, is geographic, not intrinsic. A graduated tax, on legacies, granting exemptions, Knowlton v. Moore, supra, or on incomes, Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, does not violate this clause of the Constitution, nor are such taxes infringements on the Fifth Amendment. Knowlton v. Moore, supra, page 109, of 178 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 747; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., supra, pages 24, 25 of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713. Graduated taxes on inheritances or successions, with provisions for exemptions, have so often been upheld as not violating either the due process or the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454, as to leave little ground for supposing that taxation by Congress embracing these \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 139]\n\u00a0\n features, and otherwise valid, could be deemed a denial of the due process clause of the Fifth. See Van Oster v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 465, 468\n, 47 S. Ct. 133\n\n\n It is suggested that the schemes of graduation and exemption in the present statute, by which the tax levied upon donors of the same total amounts may be affected by the size of the gifts to individual donees, are so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive the taxpayer of property without due process. But similar features of state death taxes have been held not to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment since they bear such a relation to the subject of the tax as not to 'preclude the assumption that the Legislature, in enacting the taxing statute, did not act arbitrarily or without the exercise of judgment or discretion which rightfully belong to it.' Stebbins v. Riley, supra, page 145 of 268 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 427, 44 A. L. R. 1454. No more can they be a basis for holding that the graduation and exemption features of the present statute violate the Fifth Amendment.\n The answer to both questions is, No.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n In the convention which framed the Constitution, Mr. King, on one occasion asked what was the precise meaning of 'direct taxation,' and Mr. Madison informs us that no one answered. That Mr. Madison took the pains to record the incident indicates that it challenged attention but that no one was able to formulate a definition. And though we understand generally what is a direct tax and what taxes have been declared to be direct, we are still as incapable of formulating an exact definition as were those who wrote the taxation clauses into the Constitution. Since the Pollock Case, however, we know that a tax on property, whether real or personal, or upon the income derived therefrom, is direct; and that to levy a tax by reason of ownership of property is to \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 140]\n\u00a0\n tax the property. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 294\n, 41 S. Ct. 272.\n The right to give away one's property is as fundamental as the right to sell it or, indeed, to possess it. To give away property is not to exercise a separate element or incident of ownership, like the use of a carriage, but completely to sever the donor's relation to the property and leave in him no element or incident of ownership whatsoever. Reasonably it cannot be doubted that the power to dispose of property according to the will of the owner is a property right. If a tax upon the sale of property, irrespective of special circumstances, is a direct tax, it is clear that a tax upon the gift of property, irrespective of special circumstances, is, likewise, direct. In my opinion, both are direct because they are in substance and effect not excise taxes but taxes upon property. By repeated decisions of this court it has become aximatic that it is the substance and not the form that controls in such matters.\n Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, involved the validity of a state statute which exacted a license fee of $50 of importers of foreign goods and other persons selling the same by wholesale, bale, or package, etc. The act was held void as imposing a duty on imports. It was argued that the tax was not upon the article but upon the person; that the state had the power to tax occupations, and this was nothing more. To this Chief Justice Marshall replied (page 444 of 12 Wheat.) in words that have been repeatedly approved in subsequent decisions of this court:\n'It is impossible to conceal from ourselves, that this is varying the form, without varying the substance. It is treating a prohibition, which is general, as if it were confined to a particular mode of doing the forbidden thing. All must perceive, that a tax on the sale of an article, imported only for sale, is a tax on the article itself.' \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 141]\n\u00a0\n In Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n, it was held that a tax on the amount of sales made by an auctioneer was a tax upon the goods sold, and, where these goods were imported in the orginal package and sold for the importer, the law authorizing the tax was void.\n\n Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509\n, 19 S. Ct. 522, it not to the contrary of these cases, but in complete accord with them. There it was held that a tax levied upon a sale of property effected at a board of trade or exchange was an excise laid upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility afforded by boards of trade or exchanges for the transaction of the business and not upon the property or the sale thereof, which, it was conceded, would be a direct tax and void without apportionment. Brief quotations from the opinion will make the distinction clear. Referring to the cases which had been cited against the tax, including Brown v. Maryland, supra, and the Pollock Case, it was said that all these cases involved the question whether the taxes assailed were in effect taxes upon property and (page 519 of 173 U. S., 19 S. Ct. 526): 'If this tax is not on the property, or on the sale thereof, then these cases do not apply.' At page 520 of 173 U. S., 19 S. Ct. 527, answering the contention that the tax was one on the property sold, it was said: It is not laid upon the property at all, nor upon the profits of the sale thereof, nor upon the sale itself, considered separate and apart from the place and the circumstances of the sale.' And finally, at page 521 of 173 U. S., 19 S. Ct. 527, the court said in words that admit of no mistake: 'A tax upon the privilege of selling property at the exchange, and of thus using the facilities there offered in accomplishing the sale, differs radically from a tax upon every sale made in any place. The latter tax is really and practically upon property. It takes no notice of any kind of privilege or facility, and the fact of a sale is alone regarded.'\n To me it seems plain that a tax imposed upon an ordinary gift, to be measured by the value of the property \n\n[280 U.S. 124, 142]\n\u00a0\n given and without regard to any qualifying circumstances, is a tax by indirection upon the property, as much, for example, as a tax upon the mere possession by the owner of a farm, measured by the value of the land possessed, would be a tax on the land. To call either of them an excise is to sacrifice substance to a mere form of words. I think, therefore, the first question certified, without stopping to consider the second, should be answered in the affirmative.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARSON PETROLEUM CO. v. VIAL(1929)\nNo. 306\nArgued: February 28, 1929Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George M. Burditt and John K. Murphy, both of Chicago, Ill., and William E. Leahy, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry P. Sneed, of New Orleans, La., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a petition by the Carson Petroleum Company, a corporation of Delaware, to enjoin Leon C. Vial, sheriff and tax collector of the parish of St. Charles, La., R. A. De Broca, assessor for the parish, and the Louisiana Tax Commission, from laying and levying against it an alleged illegal assessment of duties on a quantity of oil in storage tanks at St. Rose in the parish. They were ad valorem duties levied on all the property of the petitioner subject to taxation. The taxation was objected to because it was deemed an interference with interstate and foreign commerce.\n The District Court granted the injunction on the ground that the oil was in transit from another state to a foreign country and was halted only temporarily at St. Rose and had no situs in the parish or state. The Supreme Court of Louisiana reversed the decree and ordered that the tax be collected with the penalties imposed by law. \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n 166 La. 378, 117 So. 432. There is no dispute about the facts. We avail ourselves of the statement made by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which is a clear and fair presentation of the case:\n'The Petroleum Import & Export Corporation is a subsidiary of the Carson Petroleum Company, and owns and operates the system of tanks and pumping equipment for receiving the contents of the railroad tank cars of oil into the tanks owned by the Petroleum Import & Export Corporation and afterwards loading it into ships for export. The Port of New Orleans has no facility or equipment for assembling or receiving from railroad tank cars cargoes of oil and loading it aboard ships for export. The tanks and equipment at St. Rose, a few miles above New Orleans, were constructed for that purpose. No oil is sold at St. Rose except what is exported. The only business conducted there is the unloading of oil from railroad tank cars into the storage tanks and the loading of the oil from the storage tanks aboard the tankers for shipment to England, France, and other foreign ports. The oil is bought by the Carson Petroleum Company from the refiners in the Mid-Continent Field, comprising Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, and is shipped to St. Rose, La., in railroad tank cars consigned to the Carson Petroleum Company. The shipments are not on through bills of lading, but on an export rate, which is lower than the domestic rate. The oil is a higher grade of gasoline than is used in this country generally, and is made especially for export, because the automobiles in England, France and other foreign countries require a higher grade of gasoline than that which is used in this country. The Carson Petroleum Company takes orders for cargoes of oil from the foreign buyers, who charter the vessels to transport the oil from St. Rose to the foreign ports. The company always has orders on hand in excess of the quantity of oil at St. Rose, and buys the oil in the Mid-Continent Field for the pur- \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n pose of filling orders already received from the foreign buyers. The oil in each railroad tank car, however, is not segregated or assigned or destined to any particular cargo or shipment abroad, but is pumped into the large storage tanks, having the capacity of many tank cars, and is held in the tanks until a ship arrives, or until a sufficient quantity of oil is accumulated to make up a cargo. A ship carries from two to three million gallons; hence it takes 300 to 500 railroad tank cars, or 10 to 16 trains of tank cars, to make up a cargo of oil. The buyers are allowed a ten per cent. leeway on the quantity of oil bought for each shipment; which, as we understand, means that, if the capacity of the ship is either more or less than the quantity of oil contracted for, the buyer can demand a delivery of the ship's capacity, at the contract price of the oil per gallon, provided the quantity shall be not more than ten per cent. above or below the quantity contracted for. A delivery of the oil thus sold is made by loading the oil aboard the ship chartered by the buyer. Until the oil is thus loaded aboard a ship it belongs to the Carson Petroleum Company and is insured in the name of the company, loss payable to the company. There are times when an accumulation of oil in the tanks is awaiting the arrival of a ship, and at other times a ship is awaiting the accumulation of a sufficient quantity of oil to make up a cargo. In order to save demurrage on ships, which amounts to $1,500 or $2,000 per day on a ship, the Carson Company endeavors to have a sufficient quantity of oil on hand at St. Rose to fill each order promptly on arrival of the ship. On account of the demurrage charges on tank cars, as well as on steamships, it would be impracticable to carry on the export oil business by any other method than by storing the oil in large storage tanks as the train loads of oil arrive, and shipping from the accumulation when the ships arrive. The oil is shipped from the storage tanks in the same condition in which it was received from the tank \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n cars, without being treated in any way. The oil is never kept on hand at St. Rose any longer than is necessary. The quantity on hand is always awaiting either the arrival of a ship or the accumulation of a sufficient quantity to load a ship.'\n\n The oil company asserts that the interstate and foreign shipment of the oil, from the refineries in the Mid-Continent Field, into and across the state, and across the sea to the foreign ports, is a continuous interstate and foreign shipment, notwithstanding the stoppage and storage of the oil at St. Rose where it had to await either the arrival of a ship or the accumulation of a sufficient quantity of oil to load a ship. On the other hand, the state authorities claim that there were two separate shipments-the one which ended when the tank cars arrived and were unloaded at St. Rose, and the foreign shipment, which began when the oil was loaded aboard ship for a foreign port. Hence they contend that while the oil was stored in the tanks at St. Rose, under the protection of the state and local government, it was subject to state and local taxation, even though intended and prepared for exportation.\n The crucial question to be settled in determining whether personal property or merchandise moving in interstate commerce is subject to local taxation is that of its continuity of transit. The leading case is that of Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S. Ct. 475, in which Mr. Justice Bradley for this court laid down the principles that should be applied. It was a case of floating logs. There were two lots, one where the logs were cut in Maine, and were floated down the Androscoggin on their way to Lewiston, Mr., but after starting on the trip were detained for a season in New Hampshire by low water. It was held that they were free from local taxation in New Hampshire because they had begun the interstate trip and the cause of detention was to be found in the necessities of the passage and trip back to Maine, which was held to be continuous. \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n This ruling which was by the state court of New Hampshire was approved by this court. But in respect to the other lot, this court found that the logs were gathered in New Hampshire in what the court termed an 'entrepot,' looking to ultimate transportation to another state, but that when taxed they had not started on their final and continuous journey, and hence were not in interstate commerce and were taxable.\n In Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S. Ct. 146, 25 A. L. R. 1195, logs gathered on the West river in Vermont for a destination in New Hampshire were held not taxable in Vermont, though detained for a considerable time by a boom at Brattleboro to await subsidence of high water in the Connecticut river. It was held that as the interruption was only to promote the safe or convenient transit, the continuity of the interstate trip was not broken, as shown in State v. Engle, 34 N. J. Law, 425; State v. Carrigan, 39 N. J. Law, 35, and in Kelley v. Rhoads, \n188 \nU.S. 1\n, 23 S. Ct. 259, where sheep driven 500 miles from Utah to Nebraska, traveling 9 miles a day, were held immune from taxation in Wyoming, where they stopped and grazed on their way.\n In Hughes Bros. Timber Co. v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 469\n, 47 S. Ct. 170, pursuant to a contract of sale, logs cut were gathered on the Swamp river in Minnesota by the vendors and were floated by river to Lake Superior, there loaded onto the vendee's vessels and transported to their destination in Michigan. This court said, page 475 (47 S. Ct. 172):\n'The conclusion in cases like this must be determined from the various circumstances. Mere intention by the owner ultimately to send the logs out of the state does not put them in interstate commerce, nor does preparatory gathering, for that purpose, at a depot. It must appear that the movement for another state has actually begun and is going on. Solution is easy when the shipment has been delivered to a carrier for a destination in another \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n state. It is much more difficult when the owner retains complete control of the transportation and can change his mind and divert the delivery from the intended interstate destination, as in the Champlain Company Case. The character of the shipment in such a case depends upon all the evidential circumstances looking to what the owner has done in the preparation for the journey and in carrying it out. The mere power of the owner to divert the shipment already started does not take it out of interstate commerce, if the other facts show that the journey has already begun in good faith and temporary interruption of the passage is reasonable and in furtherance of the intended transportation, as in the Champlain Case. Here the case is even stronger in that the owner and initiator of the journey could not by his contract divert the logs after they had started from Swamp river without a breach of contract made by him with his vendee, who, by the agreement of sale, divided with him the responsibility for the continuous interstate transportation.'\n\n The principle of continuity of journey is shown in Railroad Commission of Ohio v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101\n, 32 S. Ct. 653, where coal from the Ohio mines intended for transportation on the lakes and stored for some weeks or months on docks in Cleveland for delivery beyond the lakes was held to be subject to interstate rates. So in Western Oil Co. v. Lipscomb, \n244 \nU.S. 346\n, 37 S. Ct. 623, in which, speaking of the effect of billing and rebilling in causing a break in the trip, it was said, page 349 (37 S. Ct. 624):\n'Ordinarily the question whether particular commerce is interstate or intrastate is determined by what is actually done and not by any mere billing or plurality of carriers, and where commodities are in fact destined from one state to another a rebilling or reshipment en route does not of itself break the continuity of the movement or require that any part be classified differently from the re- \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n mainder. As this court often has said, it is the essential character of the commerce, not the accident of local or through bills of lading, that is decisive.'\n\n An instance of interruption of railroad transportation is Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S. Ct. 299. Bacon, the owner of the grain, and the taxpayer, had bought it in the South and had secured the right from the railroads transporting it to remove it from their custody to his private grain elevator in Illinois where for his own purpose he proceeded to inspect, weigh, clean, clip, dry, sack, grade, or mix it, and had power under his contract with the carriers either to change its ownership, consignee, or destination, or to restore the grain, after the processes mentioned, to the carriers to be delivered at the destination in another state according to his original intention. The question was whether the removal of the grain to his private elevator interrupted the continuity of the transportation and made the grain subject to local taxation there. It was held that it did; that the grain was locally dealt with in the interest of the owner while it was in his custody and was subject to his complete disposition for a collateral business purpose of his own.\n Another case is that of General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S. Ct. 475. The company conducted a large oil business in Memphis, where it gathered from the North much oil and maintained an establishment for its distribution. It had tanks of various sizes, from which the oil was put in barrels or other small vessels to be sold locally or in other states, or to fill orders already received from customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. For years the company had unloaded its oil from its tank cars on arrival into large stationary tanks indiscriminately, and had sold and distributed it as required in its business. After a time, in order to escape the local inspection tax, part of the oil was deposited in a stationary tank No. 1 \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 105]\n\u00a0\n marked 'Oil already sold in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi,' while the local oil and that yet to be sold was kept in other tanks. The oil in No. 1 was divided according to the orders already received into barrels and larger containers, to be forwarded by rail to customers in the three states named. It was contended that oil of tank No. 1 was on a continuous trip through Memphis from sources in the North to the ascertained customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and was not taxable at Memphis. It was held that the doings of the company in thus separating the oil after it reached Memphis into various amounts in different containers was itself a local business in Memphis, and that the delivery into Memphis of the oil and its subsequent shipment made two separate interstate shipments and permitted local taxation on the oil while it awaited the second shipment. The court seemed to regard the redistribution of the oil at Memphis as a rest interrupting the journey, and the Memphis yard for the tanks as an assembling entrepot like that described by Mr. Justice Bradley in Coe v. Errol.\n The court was divided and there was very vigorous dissent. The case has caused discussion, and it must be admitted that it is a close one and might easily have been decided the other way. The result was probably affected by the impression created by the original situation and the somewhat artificial rearrangement of tanks in a large entrepot for redistribution of oil to avoid previous taxability.\n We do not think in deciding the case at bar that we should give the Crain Case the force claimed for it by the court below and by counsel for the state. Since its decision this court had had to consider several cases where there was transshipment of the commodity from local carriage in a state to a ship at an export port and conveyance thence to a foreign destination. There has been a liberal \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 106]\n\u00a0\n construction of what is continuity of the journey, in cases where the court finds from the circumstances that export trade has been actually intended and carried through.\n In Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 31 S. Ct. 279, cotton oil cake and meal destined for export was bought by the intending exporter in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. It was shipped to him on bills of lading and waybills showing the point of origin in those states and the destination at Galveston. The purchases were made for export, there being no consumption of the products at Galveston. His sales to foreign countries were sometimes for immediate and sometimes for future delivery, irrespective of whether he had the product on hand at Galveston. At times he had it on hand. At other times orders must be filled from cake or meal to be purchased in the interior or then in transit to him. When the cake reached Galveston, it was ground into meal and sacked by the exporter, and for the meal thus ground and such meal as had been bought in ground form he took out ships' bills of lading made to his order. The court said, page 526 (31 S. Ct. 288):\n'The manufacture or concentration on the wharves of the Terminal Company are but incidents, under the circumstances presented by the record, in the transshipment of the products in export trade and their regulation is within the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. To hold otherwise would be to disregard, as the Commission said, the substance of things and make evasions of the act of Congress quite easy. It makes no difference, therefore, that the shipments of the products were not made on through bills of lading or whether their initial point was Galveston or some other place in Texas. They were all destined for export and by their delivery to the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway they must be considered as having been delivered to a carrier for transportation to their foreign destination, the \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 107]\n\u00a0\n Terminal Company being a part of the railway for such purpose. The case, therefore, comes under Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n (6 S. Ct. 475), where it is said that goods are in interstate, and necessarily as well in foreign, commerce when they have 'actually started in the course of transportation to another state, or delivered to a carrier for transportation.\"\n\n In Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111\n, 33 S. Ct. 229, the question was whether the rates charged on shipments of lumber on local bills of lading from one point in Texas to another, but destined for export, were intrastate or foreign commerce. The exporter purchased the lumber from other mills in Texas with which to supply its sales in part. It did not know when any particular car of lumber left the starting point into which ship or to what particular destination the contents of the car would ultimately go, or on which sale it would be applied; this not being found out until its agent inspected the invoice mailed to and received by him after shipment. The lumber remained after arrival at the shipping port in the slips or on the dock until a ship chartered by the exporter arrived, when the exporter selected the lumber suited for that cargo and shipped it to its destination. There was no local market for lumber at the port of shipment, the population of which did not exceed 50, and the exporter had never done any local business at that point. This court held that the shipments to the point of shipment from other points of Texas were in interstate and foreign commerce and should pay rates accordingly. The court said, page 126 (33 S. Ct. 234):\n'The determining circumstance is that the shipment of the lumber to Sabine was but a step in its transportation to its real and ultimate destination in foreign countries. In other words, the essential character of the commerce, not its mere accidents, should determine. It was to supply the demand of foreign countries that the lumber was purchased, manufactured and shipped, and to give \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 108]\n\u00a0\n it a various character by the steps in its transportation would be extremely artificial. Once admit the principle and means will be afforded of evading the national control of foreign commerce from points in the interior of a state. There must be transshipment at the seaboard, and if that may be made the point of ultimate destination by the device of separate bills of lading the commerce will be given local character, though it be essentially foreign.'\n\n Again this court said, page 130 (33 S. Ct. 236):\n'And the shipment was not an isolated one but typical of many others, which constituted a commerce amounting in the year 1905 to 14,667,670 feet of lumber and in the year 1906, 39,554,000 feet. Nor was there a break, in the sense of the Interstate Commerce law and the cited cases, in the continuity of the transportation of the lumber to foreign countries by the delay and its transshipment at Sabine. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n (25 S. Ct. 276). Nor, as we have seen, did the absence of a definite foreign destination alter the character of the shipments.'\n\n See also Railroad Commission v. Texas & Pacific Ry., \n229 \nU.S. 336\n, 33 S. Ct. 837; Spaulding & Bros. v. Edwards, \n262 \nU.S. 66, 70\n, 43 S. Ct. 485.\n We do not think the Sabine Tram Case can be distinguished from the one before us. It has been suggested that in the present case there was a failure to fix the exact point of destination abroad before shipment and that this prevents the continuity required in a continuous exportation. But there was the same indefiniteness on this point in the Sabine Tram Case. Then, it is said, there was no separation of the various shipments of oil from the interior points to the tanks and thence to ships at the port of shipment. But in the Sabine Tram Case cars of lumber were sent to the transshipment point without regard to the filling of one order or another. In both cases the delay in transshipment was due to nothing but the failure of the arrival of the subject to be shipped at the same \n\n[279 U.S. 95, 109]\n\u00a0\n time as the arrival of the ships at the port of transshipment. The use of the tanks at the point of transshipment cannot be distinguished from the storing of the lumber on the docks or in the slips between them till the vessel to carry it should be ready. The quickness of transshipment in both cases was the chief object each exporter plainly sought. In both cases the selection of the point of shipment and the equipment at that point were solely for the speedy and continuous export of the product abroad and for no other purpose. No lumber or oil was sold there but that to be exported. There was no possibility of any other business there. Whatever hesitation might be prompted in deciding this case, if the Crain Case stood alone, the effect of the decisions of this court since is such as to make it inapplicable to the case before us.\n The judgment is reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SANFORD are in favor of affirming the judgment on the authority of General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S. Ct. 475. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL NEW ENGLAND RY. CO. v. BOSTON & A. R. CO.(1929)\nNo. 532\nArgued: April 19, 1929Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John L. Hall, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Lowell A. Mayberry, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is an interstate rail carrier having a branch line, a portion of which formerly extended a distance of 1.87 miles from Feeding Hills to Agawam Junction, Mass., where it connected with the line of respondent. In order to secure an entrance to Springfield, Mass., petitioner, on October 25, 1899, entered into a contract which provided that until August 30, 1940, it should have the right to operate a limited number of trains per day over the line of respondent from Agawam Junction to Springfield, for which it agreed to pay the sum of \n\n[279 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n $15,000 annually. In 1921, purporting to act under a certificate of public necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, petitioner abandoned this section of its branch line, notified respondent that it would no longer meet its obligations under the contract, and proceeded to sever the connection between their lines.\n This suit was brought by the New York Central Railroad, lessee of the present respondent, in the superior court for Suffolk county, Massachusetts, to recover from petitioner the annual payments due under the contract and a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff. Exceptions to rulings on the trial in the superior court were overruled by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on condition that the present respondent be substituted as plaintiff. 162 N. E. 324. The superior court entered judgment for respondent in accordance with the rescript of the higher court. The judgment of the superior court was thus, under local practice, a final decision of the highest court of the state in which the decision could be had and the writ of certiorari, granted January 2, 1929 ( \n278 \nU.S. 596\n, 49 S. Ct. 176, 73 L. Ed. -), was properly directed to that court. see DaviS v. l. l. Cohen & Co., \n268 \nU.S. 638, 639\n, 45 S. Ct. 633, Myers v. International Trust Co., \n273 \nU.S. 380, 381\n, 47 S. Ct. 372.\n Petitioner offered several defenses to the suit in the state court, only two of which involve federal questions, and which alone may be considered here.\n\n 1. \nIn June, 1921, petitioner made application to the Interstate Commerce Commission, as required by section 1, paragraph 18, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 474 (49 USCA  1(18), 'for a certificate of public convenience and necessity ... permitting the abandonment of operation of its line between Feeding Hills ... and Agawam Junction, ...' on the grounds that it could not be operated, except at a large annual loss, and other available transportation facilities had rendered its continuance unnecessary. The Commis- \n\n[279 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n sion issued its certificate accordingly, authorizing petitioner to abandon the designated section of its branch line.\n It is contended by petitioner that the effect of the order was to relieve it from making any further annual payments under its contract. It is said that the provisions of the Transportation Act conferring broad powers on the Interstate Commerce Commission, and designed to secure to interstate carriers an adequate return and the segregation from surplus earnings of a revolving fund for their benefit, see Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472, taken in conjunction with its authority to permit the abandonment by a carrier of a part of its line, evidence a purpose to grant to the Commission power to relieve the carrier from the further performance of obligations already incurred which are incidental to the operation of the abandoned section. From this it is concluded that, as the abandonment of the branch line by which alone petitioner could reach the tracks of respondent, made it impossible for petitioner to exercise its trackage rights over the lines of respondent, the order permitting the abandonment must be taken to have relieved petitioner from its obligation to make further payments which served but to reduce its revenues and so to burden its other commerce.\n Respondent argues, with persuasive force, that the purpose of  1, paragraphs 18, 19, 20 of the Transportation Act, was merely to protect the public from ill-advised or improper abandonment of its line by an interstate carrier, Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452, and that it conferred no authority upon the Commission to relieve a carrier of its contractual obligations either past or prospective, with respect to an abandoned line. But we need not pass on this contention. It suffices, for present purposes, that the certificate and the accompanying report of the Commission did not purport to exercise such a power. \n\n[279 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n The former certified only that present and future public convenience and necessity permitted the abandonment of the designated section of petitioner's branch line and that petitioner was authorized to abandon it. No reference was made in it to the present or any other contractual obligation of petitioner, and respondent, whose rights were vitally affected by the order, if petitioner's contention is to be supported, was not notified of the proceeding before the Commission nor a party to it.\n The report mentioned the fact that petitioner's trains entered Springfield over the tracks of the Boston & Albany, for which privilege it paid $15,000 annually, and included a finding that the operating loss for the abandoned section for the year 1920 was $38,832.58. But even though it be possible to spell out of this finding as to revenue the conclusion that the net loss included the annual rental of $15,000, the findings did not so state, nor was the trackage agreement otherwise mentioned. The omission from the certificate of any reference to the contract thus brought to the attention of the Commission, plainly evidences an absence of intention to deal with it. Even if the broad purposes ascribed to the act be assumed, it is not to be supposed that the Commission intended to do more than was stated in its order or to deprive respondent of income to which it was entitled under its contract for the purpose of lightening the financial burden of petitioner, both of whom were interstate carriers, without giving respondent an opportunity to be heard and without dealing with the question specifically.\n To the suggestion of petitioner that, by force of the statute, the permission to abandon its line necessarily operated to cancel its obligation, regardless of the intention of the Commission, we need only say that the statute contains no such provision nor any language suggesting it. We need not decide whether such may be the effect of a proper order of the Commission on contracts previously \n\n[279 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n entered into by the carrier and not expressly mentioned in the order, where the contract and the order necessarily conflict. See Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 42 S. Ct. 239. Cf. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. But without such a conflict, there could be no justification for holding that the order would also operate sub silentio to release a carrier from a contract merely because it had ceased to be of value through compliance with the order. This is especially the case where the other party to the contract is another common carrier with whose financial condition the Commission is equally concerned.\n\n 2. \nPetitioner also challenged the jurisdiction of the state court. As the suit is upon contract and does not assail the order of the Commission, it is not one to 'enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend' an order of the Commission of which the federal district courts are given exclusive jurisdiction under section 208 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  46). Hence the state court retained its jurisdiction to give 'remedies now existing at common law,' preserved by section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  22), Pennsylvania R. R. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 \nU.S. 121\n, 35 S. Ct. 484, Pennsylvania R. R. v. Sonman Coal Co., \n242 \nU.S. 120\n, 37 S. Ct. 46, and subject to the power of revision by this court it could construe the order of the Commission, Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285\n, 42 S. Ct. 477.\n In Lambert Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 377\n, 42 S. Ct. 349; Venner v. Michigan Central R. R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 127\n, 46 S. Ct. 444; North Dakota v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 485\n, 42 S. Ct. 170; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Public Util. Comm., \n245 \nU.S. 493\n, 38 S. Ct. 170, relied upon by petitioner, affirmative relief was prayed directing either that the order be set aside, or that the carrier do or refrain from doing acts in a manner inconsistent with the order of the Commission directing or permitting certain administrative acts to be per- \n\n[279 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n formed, relief which, it was held, would operate practically to set aside the order of the Commission. Here respondent does not ask that the order be set aside or that it be regarded as illegal and void; it insists only that the order did not purport to deal with the contract between the carriers, and so cannot have the effect, attributed to it by petitioner, of annulling the contract. The question is merely one of the legal effect of the order. Neither party contests its validity or asks that the carrier be compelled to do anything inconsistent with its terms.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHASE NAT. BANK v. UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 77\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 327, 328]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dallas S. Townsend, of New York City, and Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for Chase Nat. Bank of City of New York.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 327, 332]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here from the Court of Claims, under section 288, title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  288), 43 Stat. 939, on certified questions of law concerning which instructions are desired for the proper disposition of the cause. The facts certified are:\n On September 13, 1922, after the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1921, Herbert W. Brown procured three insurance policies on his life aggregating $200,000, each naming his wife as beneficiary. Each policy re- \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 333]\n\u00a0\n served to the insured the right to change the beneficiary. All premiums on the policies were paid by the insured. On April 10, 1924, he died testate, leaving the plaintiff below his executor and an estate subject to the estate tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227. The tax as assessed by the commissioner included $9,146.76 imposed by reason of the inclusion in the estate of the proceeds of the three insurance policies, less $40,000 exemption authorized by the statute. The executor paid the tax and upon denial of a claim for refund brought the present suit in the Court of Claims to recover the tax as illegally assessed.\n The questions certified are:\n Question I: Whether the tax imposed by the final clause of section 402(f), Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 278, on life insurance policies payable in terms to beneficiaries 'other than the decedent or his estate' is a direct tax on property and void because not apportioned.\n Question II: Whether the $9,146.76 tax imposed bears such an unreasonable relation to the subject-matter of the tax as to render it void.\n Similar questions were mooted by counsel, but not decided, in Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238, 251\n, 45 S. Ct. 487.\n Section 401 of the Revenue Act of 1921 imposes a tax upon 'the transfer of the net estate of every decedent' dying after the passage of the act, and section 402 provides: 'That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, ... tangible or intangible. ... (f) To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 334]\n\u00a0\n upon his own life.' By section 406 the executor is required to pay the tax but if so paid he is given by section 408 the right to recover from the beneficiaries a part of the tax and by section 409 they are made personally liable for a share of it if not so paid.\n In the present case there is no question of the construction of the statute. The tax is plainly imposed by the explicit language of sections 401 and 402(f) if those sections are constitutionally applied. Plaintiff challenges the validity of the tax on the ground that it is not an excise or privilege tax but a direct tax on property, the insurance policies or their proceeds, and so is invalid because not apportioned as required by article 1,  2, 9, of the federal Constitution, and that in any case the measure of the tax and the methods of securing its payment are so arbitrary and capricious as to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The statute in terms taxes transfers. Like provisions in earlier acts have been generally upheld as imposing a tax on the privilege of transferring the property of a decedent at death, measured by the value of the interest transferred or which ceases at death. Cf. Y. M. C. A. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 44 S. Ct. 291; Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 62\n, 44 S. Ct. 293; New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 349\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660; Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081\n\n\n It is true, as emphasized by plaintiff, that the interest of the beneficiaries in the insurance policies effected by decedent 'vested' in them before his death and that the proceeds of the policies came to the beneficiaries, not directly from the decedent, but from the insurer. But until the moment of death the decedent retained a legal interest in the policies which gave him the power of disposition of them and their proceeds as completely as if he were himself the beneficiary of them. The precise question presented is whether the termination at death of that power and the consequent passing to the designated beneficiaries of all rights under the policies freed of the \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 335]\n\u00a0\n possibility of its exercise may be the legitimate subject of a transfer tax, as is true of the termination by death of any of the other legal incidents of property through which its use or economic enjoyment may be controlled.\n A power in the decedent to surrender and cancel the policies, to pledge them as security for loans and the power to dispose of them and their proceeds for his own benefit during his life which subjects them to the control of a bankruptcy court for the benefit of his creditors, Cohen v. Samuels, \n245 \nU.S. 50\n, 38 S. Ct. 36 (see Burlingham v. Crouse, \n228 \nU.S. 459\n, 33 S. Ct. 564, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 148), and which may, under local law applicable to the parties here, subject them in part to the payment of his debts, Domestic Relations Law, N. Y. (chapter 14, Consol. Laws),  52; Kittel v. Domeyer, 175 N. Y. 205, 67 N. E. 433; Guardian Trust Co. v. Straus, 139 App. Div. 884, 123 N. Y. S. 852, affirmed 201 N. Y. 564, 95 N. E. 1129, is by no means the least substantial of the legal incidents of ownership, and its termination at his death so as to free the beneficiaries of the policy from the possibility of its exercise would seem to be no less a transfer within the reach of the taxing power than a transfer effected in other ways through death.\n In Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, a tax had been imposed by state statute on the succession to a remainder interest which had vested under a trust created before the enactment of the taxing act. It was objected that the tax was void as retroactive and hence in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution under the ruling in Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, later applied in Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353. But by the provisions of the trust indenture a power of disposition of the remainder had been reserved to the settlor to be exercised by him at any time during his life, with the concurrence of one trustee, and we held that the freeing of the remainder of the possibility of the exercise of that power, through its termination by the death of the settlor, effected a transfer which was the appropriate subject of a \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 336]\n\u00a0\n succession tax and that the tax was not retroactive since the termination of the power which was prerequisite to the complete succession did not occur until after the enactment of the statute. The court said (page 271 of 276 U. S. (48 S. Ct. 227)):\n'So long as the privilege of succession has not been fully exercised it may be reached by the tax. See Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 U.S. 543\n ( 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215); Orr v. Gilman, \n183 U.S. 278\n (22 S. Ct. 213); Chanler v. Kelsey (\n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550) supra; Moffitt v. Kelly (\n218 \nU.S. 400\n, 31 S. Ct. 79, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1179) supra; Nickel v. Cole (\n256 \nU.S. 222\n, 41 S. Ct. 467) supra. And in determining whether it has been so exercised technical distinctions between vested remainders and other interests are of little avail, for the shifting of the economic benefits and burdens of property, which is the subject of a succession tax, may even in the case of a vested remainder be restricted or suspended by other legal devices. A power of appointment reserved by the donor leaves the transfer, as to him, incomplete and subject to tax. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 U.S. 625\n (36 S. Ct. 473). The beneficiary's acquisition of the property is equally incomplete whether the power be reserved to the donor or another.'\n\n That, it is true, was said of a succession tax, and we are here concerned with a transfer tax. The distinction was there important for it was at least doubtful whether upon the death of the settlor there was any such termination, as to him, of a power of control over the remainder such as would have been subject to a tax levied exclusively on transfers, since the power was not vested in him alone, but in him and another. See Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 73 L. Ed. - decided this day. But we think that the rule applied in Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra, to a succession tax is equally applicable to a transfer tax where, as here, the power of disposition is reserved exclusively to the transferor for his own benefit. Such an outstanding power residing exclusively in a donor to recall a gift after it is made is a limitation on the gift which makes it incomplete as to the donor as well as to the \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 337]\n\u00a0\n donee,and we think that the termination of such a power at death may also be the appropriate subject of a tax upon transfers.\n But the plaintiff says that the tax here must be deemed to be a tax on property because the beneficiaries' interests in the policies were not transferred to them from the decedent, but from the insurer, and hence there was nothing to which a transfer or privilege tax could apply. Obviously, the word 'transfer' in the statute, or the privilege which may constitutionally be taxed, cannot be taken in such a restricted sense as to refer only to the passing of particular items of property directly from the decedent to the transferee. It must, we think, at least include the transfer of property procured through expenditures by the decedent with the purpose, effected at his death, of having it pass to another. Section 402(c) taxes transfers made in contemplation of death. It would not, we assume, be seriously argued that its provisions could be evaded by the purchase by a decedent from a third person of property, a savings bank book for example, and its delivery by the seller directly to the intended beneficiary on the purchaser's death, or that the measure of the tax would be the cost and not the value or proceeds at the time of death. It is of some significance also that by the local law applicable to the insurer and the insured in this case, a beneficiary's rights in the policy and its proceeds are deemed to be the proceeds of the premiums expended by the insured and as such recoverable in full by one having an equitable claim attaching to the premiums. Holmes v. Gilman, 138 N. Y. 369, 34 N. E. 205, 20 L. R. A. 566, 34 Am. St. Rep. 463.\n The plaintiff points to no requirement, constitutional or statutory, that the termination of the power of disposition of property by death whereby the transfer of property is completed, which we have said is here the subject of the tax, must be preceded by a transfer directly from the decedent to the recipient of his bounty, of the property \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 338]\n\u00a0\n subject to the power. And we see no necessity to debate the question whether the policies themselves were so transferred, for we think the power to tax the privilege of transfer at death cannot be controlled by the mere choice of the formalities which may attend the donor's bestowal of benefits on another at death, or of the particular methods by which his purpose is effected, so long as he retains control over those benefits with power to direct their future enjoyment until his death. Termination of the power of control at the time of death inures to the benefit of him who owns the property subject to the power and thus brings about, at death, the completion of that shifting of the economic benefits of property which is the real subject of the tax, just as effectively as would its exercise, which latter may be subjected to a privilege tax, Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550. 'To make a distinction between a general power and a limitation in fee is to grasp at a shadow while the substance escapes.' Sugden, Powers (8th Ed.) 396; see Gray, Perpetuities ( 3d Ed. 1915)  526(b). And the nonexercise of the power may be as much a disposition of property testamentary in nature as would be its exercise at death, Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473; cf. United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315, 327\n, 46 S. Ct. 148; Cohen v. Samuels, supra.\n The objection urged by plaintiff under the second question, that the statutory method of fixing the tax and securing its payment infringes the Fifth Amendment, need not detain us. It is said that both the tax on those who share in the decedent's estate and that paid by the beneficiaries is larger than it otherwise would be if the proceeds of the insurance has not been included in the decedent's gross estate. But the increase in the tax to both is a consequence of including the amount of the policies in the gross estate in determining the net which is made the measure of the graduated transfer tax. The objection amounts to no more than saying that if the transfer of \n\n[278 U.S. 327, 339]\n\u00a0\n the policies or their proceeds be taxed, they should not be included with the other property of the estate in determining the rate of the tax. As it is the termination of the power of disposition of the policies by decedent at death which operates as an effective transfer and is subjected to the tax, there can be no objection to measuring the tax or fixing its rate by including in the gross estate the value of the policies at the time of death, together with all the other interests of decedent transferred at his death. Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454. The inclusion in the gross estate of gifts made in contemplation of death under section 402(c) has a like effect.\n Other objections to the operation of the statute are not discussed either because they are not of weight or are not presented by the certified facts.\n The questions propounded by the Court of Claims in form suggest that the tax is one imposed by the statute upon the policies. This we have shown is not the case. It is the transfer, which is a concomitant of the criteria laid down by the statute for imposing the tax, which is the subject of the tax. The tax is not on the policies, but we answer the questions as if inquiring about the true subject of the tax.\n Both questions are answered, No.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v. MIHAS(1929)\nNo. 21\nArgued: October 24, 1929Decided: November 25, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David H. Leake, of Richmond, Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joseph D. Ryan, of Chicago, Ill., and John P. Bramhall, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Paragraph 120, c. 110, Cahill's Revised Statutes of Illinois 1927, provides that, except in cases where an appeal or writ of error will lie under the Constitution from the state Appellate Courts to the Supreme Court, the judgments of the former shall be final, except (1) in certain cases where, in the opinion of the Appellate Court judges, ques- \n\n[280 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n tions of importance are involved, such judges may grant appeals to the Supreme Court on petition, in which case the grounds for granting such appeals shall be certified, and (2) the Supreme Court may require such cases made final in the Appellate Courts to be certified for review and determination with the same effect as though carried up by appeal or writ of error. Application was made to the state Supreme Court for a writ to review the judgment of the Appellate Court in this case, and was denied. The jurisdiction of this court in granting the petition for a writ of certiorari is now attacked on the ground that petitioner did not exhaust its remedies under state law, because it failed also to apply to the Appellate Court for a certificate of importance and an appeal, as provided in subdivision (1) above. In Minneapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Rock, \n279 \nU.S. 410\n, 49 S. Ct. 363, we had under consideration the same question, and held that the denial of an application for certiorari by the state Supreme Court was in effect an affirmative of the judgment, and that it would be unreasonable to require an application to the Appellate Court for a certificate of importance and appeal when the Supreme Court and thus approved the judgment. This court therefore has jurisdiction; and we proceed to consider the merits.\n The respondent brought an action in the superior court of Cook county to recover damages for a personal injury suffered while engaged as an employee of petitioner in interstate commerce. That court, at the conclusion of the evidence, denied a motion for a directed verdict in favor of petitioner. Upon a verdict of the jury, judgment was rendered for respondent, which the Appellate Court, on appeal, affirmed. Mihas v. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co., 249 Ill. App. 446.\n Petitioner seeks to reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court on the ground, among others, that there was no proof of negligence and the motion for a directed verdict should have been sustained.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n Mihas was employed by the railway company to care for switch lights and lamps along the right of way, and had been thus employed for about four years prior to the injury. He had lived all that time near the switch tracks in the yards at Peru, Ind. He was thoroughly familiar with the switching operations and with the fact that they were carried on every day, usually between the hours of 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning. In doing his work, he used a small speeder car, which was kept on the opposite side of the tracks from where he lived; and it was necessary for him to cross these tracks to get the car. About 10 minutes before 7 o'clock on the morning of the accident, as he came from his house, he saw two men with a truck going away from a coal car which they had been unloading. He testified that he looked to one side and the other, but did not see or hear any train or cars approaching. Proceeding directly from his house, on his way across the tracks to get the speeder car, he attempted to climb over a coal car standing with a number of others on a switch track. While in the act of doing so, a string of nine cars was forcibly propelled by means of a flying switch against the standing cars with such violence that Mihas was thrown between two cars and severely injured. The cars being switched moved at the rate of four or five miles per hour, which was not an unusual speed for that kind of an operation. Those engaged in the movement had no knowledge of Mihas' position or of his movements. One of the standing cars contained coal, and shortly prior to the switching operation the two men seen by Mihas had been engaged in unloading the coal into a truck, but at the time of the impact they had driven off and were some distance away from the standing cars. There was evidence to the effect that it was customary for trainmen personally to notify persons engaged in unloading cars before making a switching operation likely to affect them; but that such notice was exclusively for \n\n[280 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n men so engaged. Mihas testified that he knew of this practice. He heard no notice given to the men on the occasion in question; but whether he crossed the cars relying upon that fact the testimony does not make clear, although it is assumed in the briefs and arguments, and we assume that he did. He could have crossed in a roundabout way without climbing over the cars, and his selection of the latter method was for his own convenience. Mihas testified that his foreman knew about his having to cross the tracks and had never told him not to cross between the cars; but there is no evidence that the foreman or any agent or employee of the company had knowledge that Mihas ever crossed by climbing over standing cars.\n The negligence complained of is that, in making the flying switch, the standing cars were struck with great and unnecessary force; that it was the established custom of the railway company to give due notice and warning to all persons in or about such cars before moving or shunting other cars against the standing cars; and that such notice or warning was not given upon the occasion in question. The evidence, however, is that the notification or warning was exclusively for persons, not employees, engaged in unloading cars. There was no custom or duty of that kind in respect of employees engaged on or about the tracks. If there was a violation of duty, therefore, on the part of the railway company, it was not of a duty owing to Mihas; and the rule is well established that it is not sufficient for a complainant to show that he has been injured by the failure of another to perform a duty or obligation unless that duty or obligation was one owing to the complaint. In Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Nixon, \n271 \nU.S. 218\n, 46 S. Ct. 495, the facts were that a section foreman whose employment obliged him to go over and examine the track was on a tour of inspection. For that purpose \n\n[280 U.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n he used a velocipede fitted to the rails. He was overtaken by a train and killed. The negligence charged was that the engineer and foreman of the train were not on the lookout; and the proof was to that effect. It was held that that duty was one which the railroad company might owe to others but not toward the class of employees to which the deceased belonged; and a recovery for his death was reversed. In O'Donnell v. Providence & Worcester Railroad Co., 6 R. I. 211, it was held that a statute giving a right of action to one injured by the neglect of the railroad company to ring the locomotive bell before making a highway crossing was designed exclusively for the benefit of persons crossing the highway, and one injured while walking along the track not at a crossing could not recover under the statute. The court said (page 214 of 6 R. I.):\n'If the defendants have violated any duty owing from them to the plaintiff, and by means or in consequence of that violation the plaintiff has suffered injury, he has a right to compensation and damages at the hands of the defendants for such injury. In the language of the books, an action lies against him who neglects to do that which by law he ought to do, (1 Vent. 265; 1 Salk. 335,) and that, whether the duty be one existing at common law, or be one imposed by statute. In order, however, to a recovery, it is not sufficient that some duty or obligation should have been neglected by the defendants, but it must have been a neglect of some duty or obligation to him who claims damages for the neglect. In 1 Comyns's Digest, Action upon Statute, F, it is said, 'In every case where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of the wrong done to him contrary to said law,' confining the remedy to such things as are enacted for the benefit of the person suing.' \n\n[280 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n See, also, Pheasant v. Director General of Railroads (C. C. A.) 285 F. 342, 344; Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Swann's Adm'x, 160 Ky. 458, 469, 169 S. W. 886, L. R. A. 1915C, 27.\n\n There is nothing in the record to show that employees engaged in the switching operation knew or had reason to believe that Mihas was in any position of danger. In the absence of such knowledge or ground for belief, they were not required to warn him of the impending switching operation or take other steps to protect him. Toledo, St. L. & W. R. R. v. Allen, \n276 \nU.S. 165, 173\n, 48 S. Ct. 215.\n The evidence failing to show negligence on the part of the company, the motion for a directed verdict in favor of the petitioner should have been granted.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v. STAPLETON(1929)\nNo. 133\nArgued: April 9, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. LeWright Browning, of Ashland, Ky., for petitioner.\n Mr. George B. Martin, of Catlettsburg, Ky., for respondent. \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff is a citizen of Kentucky, and at the time of the suit was between 15 and 16 years of age. Marion Stapleton was his father and guardian. The Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company is a railway corporation of Virginia, doing an interstate commerce business in Kentucky. The plaintiff and his father were employed by the defendant as section hands, and were engaged in maintaining the railroad and the roadbed for interstate commerce. The plaintiff was directed by his father, who was his foreman, to get water for his companions. In returning with the water, he passed between or under the cars of a train standing on a switch track. The train moved unexpectedly while he was under the cars; he was run over and sustained permanent injury. The evidence showed that the boy was large and well developed, and had been working as a section hand and water carrier for nine months previously.\n The law of Kentucky in force at the time of the accident was section 331a9, Carroll's Kentucky Statutes 1922, as follows:\n'Child under sixteen; where not to work.-No child under the age of sixteen years shall be employed, permitted or suffered (1) to sew or assist in sewing belts in any capacity whatever; (2) nor to adjust any belt to any machinery; ... (6) nor to work upon any railroad whether steam, electric or hydraulic; (7) nor to operate or assist in operating any passenger or freight elevator. ...'\n\n Section 331a16 of the same statute provided:\n'Whoever employs or suffers or permits a child under sixteen years of age to work, and any parent, guardian or any adult person under whose care or control a child under such age is, who suffers or permits such child to work, in violation of any of the provisions of this act shall be \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 589]\n\u00a0\n punished for the first offense by a fine of not less than fifteen dollars nor more than fifty dollars; for a second offense by a fine of not less than fifteen dollars and not more than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; for a third or any subsequent offense by a fine of not less than two hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for not less than thirty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. ... '\n\n Suit was brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (45 USCA  51-59). The case was tried to a jury and resulted in a verdict of $17,500. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 223 Ky. 154, 3 S.W. (2d) 209. The case comes here on certiorari, and the error chiefly pressed is the giving of charge No. 3, as follows:\n'The court instructs the jury that if they believe and find from the evidence that the defendant Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company employed the plaintiff to work for it as a section hand at a time when he was under 16 years of age, and if they further believe and find from the evidence that the plaintiff while working for it as a section hand in the course of said employment, was injured at a time when he was under the age of 16 years, then the law is for the plaintiff, and the jury will so find. Unless they so believe they will find for the defendant.'\n\n The language of the Federal Employers' Liability Act shows unmistackably that the basis of recovery is negligence and that without such negligence no right of action is given under this act. New York Central R. R. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147, 150\n, 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; Erie R. R. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 170, 172\n, 37 S. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662. The question squarely presented here is whether the employment by an interstate carrier in Kentucky in the business of interstate commerce of a worker under the age of 16 years is by reason of the state statute guilty of \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 590]\n\u00a0\n negligence justifying a recovery under the federal act for injuries received during such employment. Instruction No. 3 as given above dispenses with any burden on the part of the plaintiff to show that his injury was due to his age.\n This court, in the case of Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 474\n, 46 S. Ct. 564, 565 (70 L. Ed. 1041), said:\n'By the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Congress took possession of the field of employers' liability to employees in interstate transportation by rail, and all state laws upon that subject were superseded. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 55 (32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44). Seaboard Air Line ( Ry.) v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 501 (34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475). The rights and obligations of the petitioner depend upon that Act and applicable principles of common law as interpreted by the federal courts. The employer is liable for injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence specified in the Act; and proof of such negligence is essential to recovery. The kind or amount of evidence required to establish it is not subject to the control of the several states. This court will examine the record, and if it is found that as a matter of law, the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a finding that the carrier's negligence was a cause of the death, judgment against the carrier will be reversed.'\n\n In St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern R. Co. v. Hesterly, \n228 \nU.S. 702\n, 33 S. Ct. 703, it was held that the federal act saves a right of action to relatives for pecuniary loss sustained by the death of the one wrongfully injured, but does not permit a recovery for pain and suffering of the decedent, although in suits under the state law such a recovery may be had. See also Michigan Central R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 \nU.S. 59\n, 33 S. Ct. 192.\n In Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, this court held that a state statute as to assumption of risk does not apply to a suit for an injury under the Federal \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 591]\n\u00a0\n Employers' Liability Act, but only the common law on that subject as interpreted by the federal courts.\n In New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139, Winfield was a section laborer in interstate commerce. He was tamping a cross-tie and a pebble rebounded and hit his eye. He applied for compensation under a Workmen's Compensation Act of the state. It was held that, as his injury was not due to negligence on part of the railroad and did occur in interstate commerce, the Federal Employers' Liability Act excluded recovery for it.\n In North Carolina R. R. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248\n, 34 S. Ct. 305, the action was brought in a state court of North Carolina to recover damages for the negligent killing of a locomotive fireman of the Southern Railway Company, lessee of the defendant. Under the law of the state, the North Carolina Railroad, as lessor of the Southern Railway Company, was held responsible for all acts of negligence occurring in the conduct of business upon the lessor's road, and its liability was extended to employees of the lessee, injured through the negligence of the latter. The state Supreme Court held that the Federal Employers' Liability Act did not apply. This court, reversing that court, held that the Federal Employers' Liability Act did apply to the case, and that the case should be submitted to the jury on the issue whether the fireman was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of death.\n New Orleans & Northeastern R. Co. v. Harris, \n247 \nU.S. 367\n, 38 S. Ct. 535, was a suit for damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. It was there sought to apply a Mississippi statute making it prima facie proof of negligence that an injury was done by a locomotive engine. It was held that the state statute was inapplicable. See, also, New Orleans & N. E. R. Co. v. Scarlet, \n249 \nU.S. 528\n, 39 S. Ct. 369; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Mullins, \n249 \nU.S. 531\n, 39 S. Ct. 368; Central Vermont R. Co. v.

Ct. 729\n\n\n The exclusive operation of the Federal Employers' Liability Act within the field of rights and duties as between an interstate commerce common carrier and its employees has been illustrated in opinions of this court applying that act by quotation of the words of Mr. Justice Story in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617 (10 L. Ed. 1060), used in another association:\n'If this be so, then it would seem, upon just principles of construction, that the legislation of Congress, if constitutional, must supersede all state legislation upon the same subject; and by necessary implication prohibit it. For, if Congress have a constitutional power to regulate a particular subject, and they do actually regulate it in a given manner, and in a certain form, it cannot be that the state legislatures have a right to interfere, and, as it were, by way of complement to the legislation of Congress, to prescribe additional regulations, and what they may deem auxiliary provisions for the same purpose. In such a case, the legislation of Congress, in what it does prescribe, manifestly indicates, that it does not intend that there shall be any farther legislation to act upon the subject-matter. Its silence as to what it does not do is as expressive of what its intention is as the direct provisions made by it. This doctrine was fully recognized by this court in the case of Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 21, 22 (5 L. Ed. 19), where it was expressly held that, where Congress have exercised a power over a particular subject given them by the Constitution, it is not competent for state legislation to add to the provisions of Congress upon that subject; for that the will of Congress upon the whole subject is as clearly established by what it had not declared, as by what it has expressed.'\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 587, 593]\n\u00a0\n We come then to the specific question whether the violation of a statute of a state prohibiting the employment of workmen under a certain age and providing for punishment of such employment should be held to be negligence in a suit brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. That the state has power to forbid such employment and to punish the forbidden employment when occurring in intrastate commerce, and also has like power in respect of interstate commerce so long as Congress does not legislate on the subject, goes without saying. But it is a different question whether such a state act can be made to bear the construction that a violation of it constitutes negligence per se or negligence at all under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The Kentucky act, as we have set it out above, is a criminal act and imposes a graduated system of penalties. There is nothing to indicate that it was intended to apply to the subject of negligence as between common carriers and their employees. It is true that in Kentucky and in a number of other states it is held that a violation of this or a similar state act is negligence per se, and such a construction of the act by a state court is binding and is to be respected in every case in which the state law is to be enforced.

But, when the field of the relations between an interstate carrier and its interstate employees is the subject of consideration, it becomes a federal question and is to be decided exclusively as such.\n We have not found any case in which this question has been presented to the federal courts, but there are three or four well-reasoned cases in state courts, wherein this exact point is considered and decided. \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 594]\n\u00a0\n In the case of Smithson v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 174 Cal. 148, 162 P. 111, an action was brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act by an employee against an interstate carrier. The California law provided that no minor under the age of 18 years should be employed between 10 o'clock in the evening and 5 o'clock in the morning, and the trial court charged that, if the jury believed from the evidence that the employment or permission to work at night hours contributed to his injuries, the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. This was held to be error because of the exclusive provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.\n In Petranek v. Minneapolis, St. Paul & S. S. M. R. Co., 240 Mich. 655, 216 N. W. 467, where an accident causing an injury to a 16 year old boy working for a railroad as a section hand occurred while the boy and railroad were engaged in interstate commerce, it was held that the plaintiff could not rely on the violation of a state statute forbidding the hiring of boys under 18 in a hazardous employment as evidence of negligence, but that, in its exercise of its right to control means by which interstate commerce should be carried on, Congress dealt exclusively with the matter of employers' liability to employees for injuries occurring in that commerce.\n In St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co. v. Conly, 154 Ark. 29, 241 S. W. 365, plaintiff was a minor 15 years of age, working for defendant railroad in interstate commerce, and was injured therein. It was held that a state law prohibiting such employment could not supplement or change the rule as to negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The court said:\n'It is therefore wholly beyond the power of the state Legislature to make carriers engaged in interstate commerce civilly liable in damages for injuries to their employees while engaged in such commerce for the violation of some police regulation of the state. This power \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 595]\n\u00a0\n of Congress, under the commerce clause of the Constitution, does not in any manner trench upon or dislodge the police power of the states over their own local and internal affairs which are reserved to them under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.'\n\n See, also, St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern R. Co. v. Steel, 129 Ark. 520, 197 S. W. 288.\n A similar case was McLain v. Chicago Great Western R. Co., 140 Minn. 35, 167 N. W. 349, 12 A. L. R. 688. In that case an action its securities and currently has no Federal Employers' Liability Act, and it was held that a city ordinance and police regulation limiting the speed of trains, having all the effect of a statute, could not be admitted as evidence of contributory negligence. The Supreme Court of Minnesota said:\n'The act covers the entire field under which the employer in interstate commerce shall be liable for injury to its employee likewise engaged. It pertains solely to the relation of master and servant. It does not supersede state legislation outside of this field, nor does it deal with the duties or obligations of either to the public; but it does supersede all state and municipal legislation governing the circumstances under which the master, while within the provisions of the act, shall be liable for injury to the servant. It follows that the ordinance in question was superseded by the act of Congress and was not admissible in evidence.'\n\n The citations from these state cases, four of them, seem to show that their effect is confined to the government of the relation between the employer and the employee, between the common carrier and the interstate commerce agent. A different rule might well apply where the issue and the litigation is with reference to the duties of the common carrier in dealing with the public, with passengers or with strangers. The cases cited were decided only after a full examination of the cases on the subject of the Federal Employers' Liability Act in this court. \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 596]\n\u00a0\n The cases chiefly relied on by respondent are cases which were decided before the Federal Employers' Liability Act was passed. A palpable instance of this is the case of Narramore v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 96 F. 298, 48 L. R. A. 68. It was a suit of which the federal court took jurisdiction because of diverse citizenship of the parties, but it involved the application of an Ohio statute requiring railroads to block the frogs, switches, and guard rails on their tracks, on penalty of a fine. State statutes relating to duties of the railroad company as a common carrier and enacted to secure the safety of the public are obligations on the company in many ways; but they cannot encroach on the field occupied by admissible federal statutes. Therefore the Narramore and other cases cited have no application to the present case because they did not involve the construction or effect of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Hover & Co. v. Denver & R. Grande Western R. R. (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 881; Star Fire Clay Co. v. Budno (C. C. A.) 269 F. 508; Klicke v. Allegheny Steel Co. (C. C. A.) 200 F. 933; Steel Car Forge Co. v. Chec (C. C. A.) 184 F. 868.\n Frese v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 1\n, 44 S. Ct. 1, is relied on by the plaintiff. In that case a state statute made it the duty of a locomotive engineer to stop his train within a certain distance of a crossing of another railroad and positively to ascertain that the way was clear and that the train could safely resume its course before proceeding to pass the crossing. The duty was a personal one, which could not be devolved by custom upon the fireman, and it was held that the failure of the engineer to comply with the duty was a defense to an action for his resulting death, brought by his administratrix under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. This was a crossing of two railroads, a crossing where appropriate precautions must be taken to avoid collision between railroad trains, whether state or interstate. It was a situation dependent \n\n[279 U.S. 587, 597]\n\u00a0\n for public safety on the enforcement of the state law as against the employees of all railroads, state or interstate. The application of the state statute was not by way of enlargement or contraction of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. See Salabrin v. Ann Arbor R. Co., 194 Mich. 458, 160 N. W. 552; Pennsylvania Co. v. Stalker, 67 Ind. App. 329, 119 N. E. 163.\n We think that the statute of Kentucky, limiting the age of employees and punishing its violation, has no bearing on the civil liability of a railway to its employees injured in interstate commerce, and that application of it in this case was error.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOGEN v. UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 89\nArgued: November 20, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sanford H. Cohen, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cogen, with others as codefendants, was indicted in the federal court for southern New York on a charge of conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). Before the indictment, certain papers had been taken from his person without a warrant. After the indictment and before trial, he applied to that court, in the criminal case, for an order requiring the United States attorney to return the papers; and to suppress all evidence obtained therefrom, on the ground that the search and seizure had been in violation of his constitutional rights. The application was denied. Before the trial of the cause, Cogen sued out a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals. It dismissed the writ, holding that the order sought to be reviewed was interlocutory and hence not appealable. 24 F.(2d) 308. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n277 \nU.S. 579\n, 48 S. Ct. 436. The sole question for decision is whether the order of the District Court is a final judgment within the meaning of section 128 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  225).\n Cogen claims that it is final, contending that his application for surrender of the papers is a collateral matter, distinct from the general subject of the litigation, and that the order thereon finally settled the particular controversy. He argues that, being so, it falls, like the orders in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 203, 204; Trustees of Internal Improv. Fund v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n, 531; and Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 699\n, 4 S. Ct. 638, within the exception to the general rule which limits the right of review to judgments which are \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n both final and complete. See Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 40 S. Ct. 347; Oneida Navigation Corp. v. W. & S. Job & Co., \n252 \nU.S. 521\n, 40 S. Ct. 357.\n It is true that the order deals with a matter which, in one respect, is deemed collateral. As was said in Segurola v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 106, 111\n, 112 S., 48 S. Ct. 77, 79 (72 L. Ed. 186): '... A court, when engaged in trying a criminal case, will not take notice of the manner in which witnesses have possessed themselves of papers or other articles of personal property, which are material and properly offered in evidence because the court will not in trying a criminal cause permit a collateral issue to be raised as to the source of competent evidence. To pursue it would be to halt in the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation and which is wholly independent of it.' Hence, a defendant will, ordinarily, be held to have waived the objection to the manner in which evidence has been obtained unless he presents the matter for the consideration of the court seasonably in advance of the trial; and he does this commonly by a motion made in the cause for return of the property and for suppression of the evidence. The rule is one of practice; and is not without exceptions. See Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 305\n, 41 S. Ct. 261; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 34\n, 35 S., 46 S. Ct. 4, 51 A. L. R. 409; Panzich v. United States (C. C. A.) 285 F. 871, 872.\n It is not true that the order on such a motion deals with a matter distinct from the general subject of the litigation. Usually the main purpose of the motion for the return of papers is the suppression of evidence at the forthcoming trial of the cause. The disposition made of the motion will necessarily determine the conduct of the trial and may vitally affect the result. In essence, the motion resembles others made before or during a trial to secure or to suppress evidence, such as applications to \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n suppress a deposition, Grant Bros. Const. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 647, 661\n, 662 S., 34 S. Ct. 452; Pullman Co. v. Jordan (C. C. A.) 218 F. 573, 577; to compel the production of books or documents, Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co. (C. C. A.) 156 F. 765; for leave to make physical examination of a plaintiff, Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Botsford, \n141 \nU.S. 250\n, 11 S. Ct. 1000; or for a subpoena duces tecum, Murray v. Louisiana, \n163 \nU.S. 101, 107\n, 16 S. Ct. 990; American Lithographic Co. v. Werckmeister, \n221 U.S. 603\n, 608-610, 31 S. Ct. 676. The orders made upon such applications, so far as they affect the rights only of parties to the litigation, are interlocutory. Compare Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117\n, 26 S. Ct. 356. It is only when disobedience happens to result in an order punishing criminally for contempt, that a party may have review by appellate proceedings before entry of the final judgment in the cause. Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 110\n, 111 S., 42 S. Ct. 427.\n It is not true that the decision on such a motion for the return of papers necessarily settles the question of their admissibility in evidence. If the motion is denied, the objection to the admissibility as evidence is usually renewed when the paper is offered at the trial. And, although the preliminary motion was denied, the objection made at the trial to the admission of the evidence may be sustained. For as was said in Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 312\n, 313 S., 41 S. Ct. 261, 266 (65 L. Ed. 647): '... Where, in the progress of a trial, it becomes probable that there has been an unconstitutional seizure of papers, it is the duty of the trial court to entertain an objection to their admission or a motion for their exclusion and to consider and decide the question as then presented, even where a motion to return the papers may have been denied before trial.' Upon a review of the final judgment against the defendant, both the refusal to order return of the property and its admission in evidence are commonly assigned as errors. See Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 387-389, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177; Byars v. United States, 273 \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 28, 29, 47 S. Ct. 248; Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192, 193\n, 194 S., 48 S. Ct. 74.1 Compare Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585, 594\n, 24 S. Ct. 372.\n Motions for the return of papers and the suppression of evidence made in the cause in advance of the trial, under this rule of practice, must be differentiated from independent proceedings brought for a similar purpose. Where the proceeding is a plenary one, like the bill in equity in Dowling v. Collins (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 62, its independent character is obvious; and the appealability of the decree therein is unaffected by the fact that the purpose of the suit is solely to influence or control the trial of a pending criminal prosecution. Applications for return of papers, or other property may, however, often be made by motion or other summary proceeding, by reason of the fact that the person in possession is an officer of the court. See United States v. Maresca (D. C.) 266 F. 713; United States v. Hee (D. C.) 219 F. 1019, 1020. Compare Weinstein v. Attorney General (C. C. A.) 271 F. 673. Where an application is filed in that form, its essential character and the circumstances under which it is made will determine whether it is an independent proceeding or merely a step in the trial of the criminal case. The independent character of the summary proceedings is clear, even where the motion is filed in a criminal case, whenever the application for the papers or other property is made by a stranger to the litigation, compare Ex parte Tiffany, \n252 \nU.S. 32\n, 40 S. Ct. 239; Savannah v. Jesup, \n106 \nU.S. 563\n, 1 S. Ct. 512; Gumbel v. Pitkin, \n113 \nU.S. 545\n, 5 S. Ct. 616; or wherever the motion is filed before there is any indictment or information against the movant, like the motions in Perlman v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 7\n, 38 S. Ct. 417, and Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 574, 13 A. L. R. 1159; or wherever the criminal proceeding contemplated or pending is in another court, like the motion in Dier v. Banton, \n262 \nU.S. 147\n, 43 S. Ct. 533; or wherever \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n the motion, although entitled in the criminal case, is not filed until after the criminal prosecution has been disposed of, as where under the National Prohibition Act a defendant seeks, after acquittal, to regain possession of liquor seized. \n2\n And the independent character of a summary proceeding for return of papers may be so clear, that it will be deemed separate and distinct, even if a criminal prosecution against the movant is pending in the same court. This was true in Essgee Co. of China v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 151\n, 43 S. Ct. 514, where the petition was entitled as a separate matter and was referred to by the court as a special proceeding.\n Motions for the return of property, made in connection with a motion to quash a search warrant issued under the National Prohibition Act, may be independent proceedings, but are not necessarily so. By Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, title 2,  25, 41 Stat. 315 (27 USCA  39), and Espionage Act, June 15, 1917, c. 30, title 11,  16, 40 Stat. 229 (18 USCA  626), Congress made specific provision, by an independent proceeding, for the vacation of a warrant wrongfully issued and for return of the property. \n3\n Dumbra v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 435\n, 45 S. Ct. 546, was such a case. Steele v. United States (No. 1) \n267 \nU.S. 498\n, 45 S. Ct. 414, was also, so far as disclosed by the record in this court. \n4\n Because it appeared to be such, the order therein denying the application was held in Steele v. United States (No. 2) \n267 \nU.S. 505\n, 45 S. Ct. 417, to be res judicata, on the trial of the information filed after the seizure for un- \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n lawful possession of the liquor. \n5\n But a motion for the return of property, although connected with a motion to quash a search warrant, may, if made in the same court in which a criminal proceeding is pending, be so closely associated with the criminal proceeding as to be deemed a part of it. Thus, where the motion to quash the search warrant and for return of the property is made by a party to the cause is filed in the cause and seeks suppression of the evidence at the trial, it is apparent that the motion to quash the search warrant is an incident merely; that the real purpose of the application is to suppress evidence; and that it is but a step in the criminal case preliminary to the trial thereof. Circumstances may make this clear, even if the motion does not specifically pray for suppression of the evidence. In all such cases the order made on the motion is interlocutory merely. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Where in cases arising under the National Prohibition Act a defendant seeks to obtain, by motion in advance of trial, return of property which was not seized under a search warrant, the interlocutory character of the order entered thereon is ordinarily clear. \n7\n This is true of the order here in question. The motion was not for the return of papers seized under a search warrant. It was filed in the criminal case after the indictment and before \n\n[278 U.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n trial. It seeks not only return of the papers, but the suppression of all evidence obtained therefrom. And such suppression of evidence appears to be its main, if not its only purpose. The appeal was properly dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Also Murby v. United States (C. C. A.) 293 F. 849, 851; Bell v. United States (C. C.

King, Louis Titus, and C. Bascom Slemp, all of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims, now under consideration, was given on a claim against the United States for alleged patent infringement, and was entered on February 4, 1929. A petition for certiorari seeking review in this Court was filed May 1, 1929, and was denied on October 14, 1929 (\n280 \nU.S. 553\n, 50 S. Ct. 15, 74 L. Ed. -). The Government contends that both methods of review, either by appeal or certiorari, in this Court are now without avail.\n The claim was referred by the Senate to the Court of Claims for an advisory finding and report of the material facts. A hearing was had in the Court of Claims, and it reported its findings on the questions of fact. Thereafter the Court of Claims reheard the case under a Special Jurisdictional Act of Congress approved March 3, 1927 (44 Stat. c. 408, Part. 3, p. 1807), which read as follows:\n'That the findings of fact made by the Court of Claims in the case of Arthur E. Colgate, administrator of the estate of Clinton G. Colgate, deceased, against the United States, Congressional, Numbered 6063, Senate Document Numbered 703, Sixty-fourth Congress, second session, be, and they are hereby referred back to the Court of Claims with jurisdiction to render such judgment as the findings of fact heretofore found and the law require: Provided, That either party hereto may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States upon or from any conclusion of law or judgment, from which appeals now lie in other cases, at any time within ninety days after the rendition of judgment: Provided further, That the amount of any \n\n[280 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n such judgment shall not exceed the sum of $50,000: And provided further, That such notice hereof shall be given to the Attorney General of the United States as may be provided by orders of said court, and it shall be the duty of the Attorney General to cause one of his assistants to appear and defend for the United States.'\n\n Judgment for the Government in the reheard case was given by the Court of Claims on February 4, 1929, based on a letter to the Commissioner of Patents under date of January 15, 1851, from Simpson, the then owner, specifically abandoning the application for the patent.\n On April 23, 1929, Arthur Colgate, as administrator of Clinton Colgate, in pursuance of the special act, filed an application in the Court of Claims for the allowance of an appeal to this Court from the adverse judgment, and appeal was allowed by the Court of Claims on April 26, 1929. The appeal was docketed in this Court May 1, 1929, and on the same day a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on the record in the appeal case. The petition for certiorari, as already said, was denied by us October 14th last. The case is now before us for consideration of the question of our jurisdiction upon the appeal.\n We think the proper construction to be put upon this special act is that the review provided for was a petition for certiorari. One of the chief purposes of the general act of February 13, 1925, ch. 229, 43 Stat. 936 (section 3, (28 USCA  288)) was to abolish appeals from the Court of Claims to this Court and substitute therefor applications for writs of certiorari. The language of the special act is that 'either party hereto may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States upon or from any conclusion of law or judgment, from which appeals now lie in other cases.' At the time of the passage of that act, no appeals generally 'lay in other cases' from the Court of Claims to this Court, and do not now. It was evidently intended by the act of 1925 to make the method of review by this Court of judge \n\n[280 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n ments of the Court of Claims, uniform. It was intended by the act of 1925 to give this Court an opportunity to determine in advance whether the case was one worthy of review here. To hold that the case may come here only by certiorari is to make it conform to the general purpose of the act of February 13, 1925, in enlarging the use of certiorari as a method of review in this Court. To describe appeals as from judgments 'from which appeals now lie in other cases' is a mistake, unless one gives to the meaning of the word 'appeals' something more than a mere technical meaning. If what was intended was an appeal in its technical significance as distinguished from a certiorari, different words should have been used to indicate it. Therefore the special act must be construed the 1927 act, was merely extending the period usual method of review at the date of the special act, which is and was by application for a writ of certiorari.\n The case of Sisseton & Wahpeton Band of Sioux Indians v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 424\n, 48 S. Ct. 536, does not control the present case. That case had reference to another special act, granting the appellants one year from the date of the act within which to appeal, and it was held to confer the right of appeal as distinguished from the right to petition for certiorari. That special act was approved March 4, 1927 ( chapter 522, 44 Stat., Part 3, p. 1847), and its purpose was to revive a right to appeal to this Court given to the same appellants by the Act of April 11, 1916 (39 Stat. 47, c. 63), but of which appellants had failed to avail themselves within the time limited therefor. Since Congress, by the 1927 Act, was merely extending the period for the exercise of a right conferred in 1916, the term 'appeal,' contained in the statute, was naturally construed with reference to its meaning at the time the right to it was originally granted. That was granted nearly nine years before the Act of February 13, 1925, changed the mode of \n\n[280 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n appellate review of judgments of the Court of Claims from a technical 'appeal' to a petition for writ of certiorari.\n These provisions with respect to special review of cases from the Court of Claims should be carefully construed. They are generally embodied in exceptional legislation considered by other committees than the judiciary committees not especially advised as to the importance of uniformity in respect to such exceptions. It should therefore be clear, if a departure from the ordinary methods of limitation of review is intended by Congress, that the language should leave no doubt about it.\n The history of the legislation and the language used show that the reference to appeals in the special act now before us finds its counterpart in other acts having the same purpose. The language is that 'either party hereto may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States upon or from any conclusion of law or judgment from which appeals now lie in other cases.' Acts of this kind, although speaking of 'appeals,' show what is intended by the phrase, 'as in other cases.' The list of the later acts in legislation of this kind, after the passage of the Act of February 13, 1925, is as follows:\n Act of March 3, 1925 (chapter 459, 43 Stat. 1133, 1134), Kansas or Kaw Indians:\n From the decision of the Court of Claims an appeal may be taken by either party as in other cases to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Act of May 14, 1926 (chapter 300, 44 Stat. 555), Chippewas of Minnesota:\n With right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party as in other cases.\n Act of July 2, 1926 (chapter 724, 44 Stat. 801), Citizen Band of Pottawatomies:\n With the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party as in other cases. \n\n[280 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n Act of December 17, 1928 (chapter 36, 45 Stat. 1027), Winnebago tribe:\n With the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party as in other cases.\n Act of February 28, 1929 (chapter 377, 45 Stat. 1407), Shosone tribe:\n That from the decision of the Court of Claims in any suit prosecuted under the authority of this act an appeal may be taken by either party, as in other cases, to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Act of July 3, 1926 (chapter 734, 44 Stat. 807), Crow Indians:\n With right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party.\n Act of March 2, 1927 (chapter 250, 44 Stat. 1263), Assiniboine Indians:\n With right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party.\n Act of March 3, 1927 (chapter 302, 44 Stat. 1349), Shoshone Indians:\n With right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party.\n Act of May 18, 1928 (chapter 624, 45 Stat. 602), Indians of California:\n With the right of either party to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Act of February 20, 1929 (chapter 275, 45 Stat. 1249), Nez Perce tribe:\n With the right of appeal by either party to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Act of February 23, 1929 (chapter 300, 45 Stat. 1256), Coos (Kowes) Bay, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw tribes:\n And the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States is hereby granted to both parties.\n Here are included five instances in which the expression used describing the appeal is as one which would 'lie in \n\n[280 U.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n other cases,' and the whole course of the legislation indicates a desire that the same appellate review should be given as in other cases. We think that this customary language requires the uniform use of the writ of certiorari in order to secure that which a certiorari gives-a preliminary examination of proceedings by this Court before review. Unless a special reason in the act providing for appellate review indicates that the review is to be by technical appeal rather than by the ordinary method of certiorari, the latter method is the right one. This must lead to the dismissal of the present appeal. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL CASUALTY INS. CO. v. CONSOLIDATED STONE CO.(1929)\nNo. 75\nArgued: November 27, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. Rees H. Davis and Paul Lamb, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for Commercial Casualty Ins. Co.\n Mr. Norman A. Emery, of Youngstown, Ohio, for Consolidated Stone Co.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We here are concerned with a certificate wherein the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pursuant to section 346, title 28, United States Code (28 USCA  346), propounds a question of law arising in a case pending in that court. \n\n[278 U.S. 177, 178]\n\u00a0\n The material facts are: A corporation of Indiana brought a transitory action at law against a corporation of New Jersey in a federal District Court in Ohio. That court's jurisdiction was invoked only on the ground that the parties were citizens of different States, and the value of the matter in controversy was in excess of the statutory requirement. The defendant was doing business in Ohio and, in accord with the state law, had designated a local agent upon whom process against it might be served. Summons was duly served within the district upon that agent. The defendant neither appeared nor answered within the period limited therefor, and judgment went against it by default. Later in the same term the defendant moved that the judgment be vacated and the action dismissed because the action was brought in a district in which neither party resided. That motion was denied. The defendant then moved that the judgment be vacated, and leave to defend be granted, on the asserted ground that the summons, although forwarded by the agent to the defendant's home office, had been overlooked. That motion also was denied. The defendant then sued out a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals. The certificate-after eliminating the ruling on the second motion-says of the asserted basis of the first motion:\n'Familiar cases say that this defect in the jurisdiction pertains to the venue, and defendant may either insist upon it or may waive it. In this case there was neither affirmative insistence nor affirmative waiver. Defendant allowed the time for effective objections to expire and did nothing.'\n\n Shortly stated, the question propounded is whether it was open to the defendant, after permitting the cause to proceed to judgment by default, to object that the action was not brought in the district of the residence of either party. \n\n[278 U.S. 177, 179]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent statutes are sections 41 and 112, title 28, United States Code (28 USCA  41, 112). One provides that district courts shall have 'original jurisdiction' of certain classes of civil suits, including suits 'between citizens of different states,' where the value of the matter in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds $3,000. The other provides that 'where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n These provisions often have been examined and construed by this court. Summarized, the decisions are directly to the effect that the first provision invests each of the District Courts with general jurisdiction of all civil suits between citizens of different states, where the matter in controversy is of the requisite pecuniary value, and that the other provision does not detract from that general jurisdiction, but merely accords to the defendant a personal privilege respecting the venue, or place of suit, which he may assert, or may waive, at his election. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The decisions also make it plain that the privilege must be 'seasonably' asserted; else it is waived. \n2\n Whether there was a seasonable assertion in the present case is the real question to be determined.\n We are of opinion that the privilege is of such a nature that it must be asserted at latest before the expiration of the period allotted for entering a general appearance and \n\n[278 U.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n challenging the merits. In ordinary course, when that period expires the defendant either will have appeared generally for the purpose of contesting the merits or by suffering a default will have assented that his adversary's allegations be taken as confessed for the purposes of judgment. In either event the suit will have reached the stage where attention must be given to the merits. In common practice objections to venue are presented and acted upon at an earlier stage; and this, so far as we are advised, is true of the elective privilege here in question. No adjudged case is cited in which a different practice is either sustained or shown. To hold that such a privilege may be retained until after the suit has reached the stage for dealing with the merits and then be asserted would be in our opinion subversive of orderly procedure and make for harmful delay and confusion.\n It was apparent on the face of the plaintiff's petition that jurisdiction was grounded solely on diversity of citizenship and that the suit was brought in a district of which neither party was a resident. The defendant, although duly served with a proper summons apprising it of the time within which it was required to appear and answer, permitted that time to elapse without making any objection to the venue, or place of suit, by motion, pleading or otherwise.\n The Ohio practice statute prescribes that all objections thus appearing when so neglected shall be deemed to have been waived, 'except only that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject-(matter) of the action and that the petition does not state facts which show a cause of action.' Gen. Code Ohio,  11311.\n Here the objection was not that the court was without jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit, but that the suit was not brought in the district of the residence of either party-a waivable matter of venue only. 3 \n\n[278 U.S. 177, 181]\n\u00a0\n Our conclusion is that the objection was not seasonably made and therefore that under our decisions, as also the Ohio statute, it was waived. The question before stated must be answered in the negative. A second or alternative question is propounded in the certificate, but an answer to it is rendered unnecessary by the answer to the other.\n Question No. 1: Answer, No. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lee v.

Lawrence H. Cake, of Washington, D. C., and Clyde A. De Witt, and E. Arthur Perkins, both of Manila, Philippine Islands, for petitioner. \n\n[279 U.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Spanish corporation, brought suit in the court of first instance of the city of Manila, to recover income taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted. Judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. Vol. XXVI, Philippine Official Gazette, No. 65, May 31, 1928, p. 1712. This court granted certiorari October 22, 1928 (\n278 \nU.S. 591\n, 49 S. Ct. 29, 73 L. Ed. -), under section 7 of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 940 (28 USCA  349).\n The tax was assessed under section 10 of the Philippine Income Tax Law of March 7, 1919, Act 2833, 14 Pub. Laws P. I. 221, as amended by section 7 of Act 2926, March 26, 1920, 15 Pub. Laws P. I. 260, which imposed a tax of 3 per cent. annually '... upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources within the Philippine Islands by every corporation ... organized ... under the laws of any foreign country ...' The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts and the question presented is whether the profit or income, upon which the tax now in question was assessed, was received from 'sources within the Philippine Islands' within the meaning of the statute.\n The stipulated facts are that petitioner, a foreign corporation, was licensed to do business in the Philippine Islands and there maintained its principal office and did most of its business; that it owned in the Islands various sugar and oil mills and tobacco factories, and was there engaged in buying, selling, and exporting these products; that, acting through its Philippine branch, petitioner from time to time during 1922 exported from the Philippine \n\n[279 U.S. 306, 308]\n\u00a0\n Islands to the United States tobacco, sugar, copra and cocoanut oil, produced, manufactured or purchased by it in the Philippine Islands; that this merchandise '... was sold in the United States by the agency therein of the plaintiff's Philippine branch, the sale being subject to confirmation and absolute control as to price and other terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine branch; and that from such transactions ... the plaintiff made a profit, ...' which was ' ... accounted for by the plaintiff on its books of account kept in the Philippine Islands as earnings made by and accruing to the Philippine branch. ...' It was this net profit on which the tax was levied.\n Petitioner insists that, as the stipulation recites that the merchandise was 'sold' in the United States, the profit derived from the sales was not from sources within the Philippine Islands and was, therefore, not subject to the tax. Section 10 of the Philippine Act is substantially similar to the corresponding section of the United States Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463,  10, 39 Stat. 756, 765, and, in support of its position, petitioner cites opinions of the Attorney General of the United States ruling that a profit made by a foreign corporation from the sale, in other countries, of merchandise produced or purchased in the United States was not taxable income 'from sources within the United States' under the latter act, and the similar provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1917 (Act Oct. 3, 1917, c. 63,  1206, 40 Stat. 300, 333) and of 1918 (Act Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18,  233, 40 Stat. 1057, 1077). See opinions of the Attorney General of January 21, 1924. (34 Ops. Attys. Gen. 93), and of November 3, 1920 (32 Ops. Attys. Gen. 336). These opinions were accepted and applied by Treasury Decision 3576, Cum. Bull. III-1-211, and Treasury Decision 3111, 4 Cum. Bull. 280. See, also, Birkin v. Commissioner, 5 B. T. A. 402; Appeal of Yokohama Ki-Ito Kwaisha, Ltd., 5 B. T. A. 1248; Billwiller v. \n\n[279 U.S. 306, 309]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 841; R. J. Dorn & Co. v. Commissioner, 12 B. T. A. 1102; O. D. 651, 3 Cum. Bull. 265.\n While the stipulation states that the merchandise was 'sold' in the United States by petitioner's agency there, this statement cannot be taken without qualification; it must be read with the limitation immediately following, that such sales were 'subject to confirmation and absolute control as to price and other terms and conditions' by petitioner's Philippine branch. It does not appear whether the confirmation was, in each case, given by the Philippine branch direct to the buyer or was otherwise the final act consummating the sales within the Philippine Islands, or whether, as the trial court and petitioner seem to have assumed, it was a mere approval or ratification of the negotiations had by petitioner's American agent, and authority to him to confirm or otherwise complete the sales in the United States. Certainly, if the former, the final acts of petitioner making effective the sales, which were the source of the profit, took place in the Philippine Islands as an incident to and part of its business conducted there. See Holder v. Aultman, \n169 \nU.S. 81, 89\n, 18 S. Ct. 269; Lloyd Thomas Co. v. Grosvenor, 144 Tenn. 349, 233 S. W. 669; Charles A. Stickney Co. v. Lynch, 163 Wis. 353, 158 N. W. 85; Shuenfeldt. v. Junkermann (C. C.) 20 F. 357.\n If, in fact, the sales were thus made in the Philippine Islands, we think it unimportant whether the merchandise sold was exported before or after its sale; it could not be seriously contended, and indeed petitioner does not contend, that a profit derived from such transactions would not be subject to the tax. For, in such a case, the entire transaction resulting in a profit, with the exception of the negotiations in the United States preceding the sale, would have taken place in the Philippines. Instead, petitioner asks us to construe the stipulation so as to bring it within the ruling of the Attorney General applied to a state of facts where every act effecting the sale took place \n\n[279 U.S. 306, 310]\n\u00a0\n outside the taxing jurisdiction. The ambiguous phraseology of the stipulation failing to disclose precisely how the business was done, we may not speculate as to its actual character. See Cochran v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 387, 393\n, 41 S. Ct. 166.\n The burden is on him who seeks the recovery of a tax already paid to establish those facts which show its invalidity. United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 428\n, 46 S. Ct. 131; Fidelity Title Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 304, 306\n, 42 S. Ct. 514. Further, in the absence of a clear showing of error, this court should be slow to reverse the judgment of a territorial court on questions of fact or of local law. De Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 298\n, 36 S. Ct. 109; Fox v. Haarstick, \n156 \nU.S. 674, 679\n, 15 S. Ct. 457. For the reason indicated, the stipulation here does not sustain the burden resting on petitioner.\n We need not consider petitioner's contention that the taxing act, when applied to sales outside the Philippine Islands, conflicts with the 'equal protection' clause of the Philippine Organic Law. This argument presupposes that the sales were so made, an assumption which, as already stated, we cannot make.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUDAHY PACKING CO. v. HINKLE(1929)\nNo. 278\nArgued: January 7, 1929Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 460, 461]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Harry Covington, of Washington, D. C., and S. W. Brethorst, Thomas M. Askren, and Edward B. Palmer, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. Levi B. Donley, of Olympia, Wash., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of Court.\n Appellant is incorporated under the laws of Maine. Its authorized capital stock is $45,000,000. Less than $30,000,000 has been issued and the total value of the corporate property does not exceed that sum. It does an extensive business in meats and foodstuffs throughout the Union and abroad. During 1916 when the capital stock was $20,000,000 the articles of incorporation were duly filed with the proper state officer and the corporation began to carry on closely associated interstate and intrastate business in Washington. Its property therein is now worth $40, 000. Gross sales by the corporation for the \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n year ended October 31, 1926, were $231,750,000. Of these $1,313,275 were made in Washington, less than half being intrastate.\n The statutory provisions here important appear in the sections of Remington's Compiled Statutes of Washington mentioned below.\n Section 3852 authorizes foreign corporations to do business within the state as those organized under her laws upon compliance with conditions prescribed by sections 3853, 3854\n\n\n Section 3853 requires every foreign corporation to file with the secretary of state a certified copy of its charter, etc., and section 3854 requires appointment of a local agent.\n Section 3836 (as amended by chapter 149,  1, Laws Extraordinary Session 1925) directs that every local and foreign corporation required by law to file its articles with the secretary of state shall pay graduated filing fees, not above $3,000, reckoned upon its authorized capital stock. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Section 3837 (as amended by chapter 149,  2, Laws Extraordinary Session 1925) requires every corporation, foreign or domestic, desiring to file with the secretary of state articles \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n amendatory or supplemental articles increasing its capital stock to pay the fees prescribed in the preceding section less any sum theretofore paid. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n Section 3841 (as amended by chapter 149,  3, Laws Extraordinary Session 1925) requires corporations, foreign and domestic, to pay annual license fees, not above $3,000, reckoned upon authorized capital stock. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Sections 3842, 3843, 3844, 3846, 3855, and 3861 provide heavy penalties for failure to pay prescribed filing fees and license taxes.\n Filing fees because of the increased capital and license taxes for 1927, both reckoned upon the authroized capital stock, were demanded of appellant. Penalties for failure to comply were threatened. By an original bill in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, it set up the above-stated facts and asked an \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 465]\n\u00a0\n appropriate injunction to prevent enforcement of the demands. A court of three judges heard the cause, denied a preliminary injunction, and dismissed the bill for want of equity.\n Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 187\n, 38 S. Ct. 85, 87 (62 L. Ed. 230), examined Texas statutes which required foreign corporation to pay permit and franchise taxes graduated according to authorized capital stock and declared them in conflict with the federal Constitution because they imposed 'direct burdens on interstate commerce and moreover exerted the taxing authority of the state over property and rights which were wholly beyond the confines of the state and not subject to its jurisdiction and therefore constituted a taking without due process.' These statutes prescribed \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 466]\n\u00a0\n no maximum tax. In other respects they were not unlike the acts here under consideration.\n Unless saved by the $3,000 limitation, the Washington enactments are subject to the constitutional objections pointed out in Looney v. Crane Co ., and must be denied effect.\n Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68\n, 34 S. Ct. 15, upheld a tax based upon authorized capital stock but limited to $ 2,000 imposed by Massachusetts upon foreign corporations for the privilege of doing local and domestic business therein. Consideration was given to the fact that the corporate assets were four times the authorized capital and to the limitation. Weighing all the circumstances, the court concluded that no direct substantial burden was imposed upon interstate commerce and that property beyond the state was not taxed.\n In Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203, 218\n, 45 S. Ct. 477, 481 (69 L. Ed. 916, 44 A. L. R. 1219), we said:\n'It must now be regarded as settled that a state may not burden interstate commerce or tax property beyond her borders under the guise of regulating or taxing intrastate business. So to burden interstate commerce is prohibited by the commerce clause; and the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit taxation of property beyond the state's jurisdiction. The amount demanded is unimportant when there is no legitimate basis for the tax. So far as the language of Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 87 (34 S. Ct. 15), tends to support a different view it conflicts with conclusions reached in later opinions and is now definitely disapproved.'\n\n Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts had sometimes been regarded as lending support to the theory that a tax which really burdens interstate commerce and reaches property beyond the state may be sustained if relatively small. This view did not harmonize with the principles approved by Looney v. Crane Co., and was expressly disapproved by Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Mass. \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 467]\n\u00a0\n It follows that the decree of the court below is erroneous and must be reversed.\n Whether, becuase reckoned upon authorized and not upon actual capital stock, the challenged legislation fails to require like fees for equal privileges within the doctrine of Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71\n, 45 S. Ct. 12, we need not now consider.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The corporation maintains in Washington a branch office and a warehouse. There, it does a large intrastate business. Nearly one-half of the aggregate sales of $1,313,275.74 made within the state were local and were from broken packages. It is subjected to two taxes which are separate and distinct. The filing fee is payable only once and as laid was $545. The annual license fee is $580. The latter results in a charge of about one-tenth of 1 per cent. on the intrastate business. The corporation's pay roll there is more than a hundred times as large. These small taxes are obviously not more than a fair contribution to the necessary expenses of the state government. They are the same for foreign corporations as for domestic. In my opinion both taxes are valid.\n If the statute sought to impose a tax on corporations engaged wholly in interstate commerce, or if the taxes laid a direct burden upon interstate commerce, or if they were laid upon property without the state, or if they were unjustly discriminatory, the fact that they are small in amount would, of course, be immaterial. Sprout v. City of South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, 48 S. Ct. 502. But these taxes are not subject to any of those infirmities. The taxes are not laid upon interstate commerce. They are not measured by the amount of interstate commerce. They do not grow, or shrink, according to the volume of interstate commerce or of the capital used in it. They are not \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 468]\n\u00a0\n furtively directed against such commerce. The taxes would be precisely the same in amount if the corporation did in Washington no interstate business whatsoever. Nor are they taxes laid upon property without the state. Indeed, they are neither property taxes nor substitutes for property taxes. They are an excise, laid solely for the privilege of doing business as a corporation. An individual doing the same business would not be required to pay either these taxes or any substitute therefor.\n General Ry. Signal Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 500\n, 38 S. Ct. 360, requires, in my opinion, that the filing fee be held valid. There, a filing fee of $1,000 on an authorized capitalization of $5,000, 000 was sustained as against a foreign corporation, under a statute limiting the maximum tax to $5,000. Here, the filing fee demanded was $545 on an authorized capital nearly ten times as great; and the maximum fee demandable in any case was limited to $3,000. The General Ry. Signal Co. Case was decided by a unanimous court and the correctness of the decision has never been questioned.\n Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 147\n, 154-158, 38 S. Ct. 295, requires, in my opinion, that the license fee be held valid. That case held a statute imposing an annual license tax valid as applied to all the foreign corporations which, like the Cudahy Company here, did both intrastate and interstate business. That decision was made by a unanimous court after much deliberation. It has never been disapproved. The statute there in question is identical, so far as here material, with the Washington statute, except that the Massachusetts law fixes a maximum tax of $2,000, while here it is $3,000. But the Massachusetts statute was enacted in 1909; and the tax there challenged was laid in 1913. The Washington statute was enacted in 1925; and the tax here challenged was laid in 1926. The rise in the general prive level since 1913 makes the Wash- \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 469]\n\u00a0\n ington maximum relatively lower than that prescribed by Massachusetts.\n The Cheney Bros. Co. Case is entirely consistent with Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203\n, 45 S. Ct. 477, 44 A. L. R. 1219. In the latter case, the tax held void was on a foreign corporation engaged solely in interstate commerce, and it was laid under a different statute. The situation here is also wholly unlike that considered in Air-Way Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 79\n, 45 S. Ct. 12, and in Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S. Ct. 85, and cases there cited. In those cases, not only did the statutes fail to fix a maximum, but the taxes actually laid were so large as compared with the local business done as to constitute a substantial obstruction of interstate commerce. The case at bar is also unlike International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135\n, 38 S. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617. There the statute failed to fix any maximum.\n A tax proportionate to the capital of a corporation is sometimes laid in lieu of the ordinary property taxes, and in such cases is treated as a property tax. But the taxes here in question are not of that nature. I am aware that it has been said by this court that a license fee of a given per cent. of the entire authorized capital of a foreign corporation doing both a local and interstate business is essentially a tax on the entire business, interstate as well as intrastate; and a tax upon property outside the state. But that was said in cases where the statute did not fix any maximum. The statement seems to me legally unsound. If it were true, that every tax imposed generally upon a foreign corporation doing both interstate and intrastate business taxed its interstate business and its property outside the state then most of such corporations would largely escape taxation. By the same process of reasoning all taxes laid by a state upon property within its borders, which is used in both intrastate and interstate commerce, would be a tax on interstate commerce. But \n\n[278 U.S. 460, 470]\n\u00a0\n such taxes have been universally upheld. They are valid, because, when the burden is indirected, even a large burden upon interstate commerce does not render a tax void. See Southern R. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 530\n, 43 S. Ct. 192; Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 305.\n It would be unfortunate to hold that merely because a foreign corporation, doing a local business, does also interstate business, the state may not lay upon it a reasonable, nondiscriminatory excise, necessarily limited to a reasonable amount, to which all domestic corporations similarly situated are subject and which can affect interstate commerce only indirectly, if at all. To hold such a tax void seems to me to ignore the wise rule of decision declared in Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 698\n, 15 S. Ct. 268, 270 (39 L. Ed. 311): 'The substance and not the shadow determines the validity of the exercise of the (taxing) power.'\n Mr. Justice HOLMES joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3836.

R. CO. v. KOSKE(1929)\nNo. 219\nArgued: January 17, 1929Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 7, 8]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter J. Larrabee, of New York City, and Jacob G. Grossberg, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. I. Faerber Goldenhorn, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued petitioner under the Federal Employers' Liability Act ( 45 USCA  51-59) in the circuit court of Hudson county, New Jersey, to recover damages for injuries sustained by him while in the service of petitioner. At the close of the evidence, defendant moved the court to direct a verdict in \n\n[279 U.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n its favor on the grounds that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of defendant and that it conclusively appeared that plaintiff assumed the risk of the accident and injury complained of. The motion was denied, there was a verdict for plaintiff, and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest court of the state.\n Plaintiff was employed in defendant's roundhouse and coal chute yard at Hoboken. The complaint alleged that defendant negligently 'permitted an open, uncovered and unlighted and dangerous hole to exist between certain parts of said tracks,' that plaintiff was there employed at 4 o'clock in the morning of June 4, 1925, and 'while alighting from an engine in the course of his said employment fell into said opening,' and was injured.\n Plaintiff's work was to put sand into the boxes on engines and to turn switches for them. During 11 years he worked nights from 9 o'clock in the evening until 7 in the morning and for one year, about 5 years before the accident, he worked in the daytime. He was familiar with the tracks and ground in the yard. Throughout the period of his employment, the yard was drained by a shallow open ditch or trench. This depression varied in depth from 8 to 11 inches and in width from 8 to 24 inches. It passed between ties under the tracks and, at a place not far from the coal chute, it extended a short distance longitudinally between the tracks. During all the time that plaintiff worked there the drain or ditch was in the same place and was maintained in the same condition as it was at the time of the accident.\n The case was tried, the jury charged, and the judgment given and affirmed upon the understanding that the place where plaintiff fell was a part of the above-mentioned longitudinal section of the drain. Nevertheless plaintiff here suggests that it is not certain that the hole com- \n\n[279 U.S. 7, 10]\n\u00a0\n plained of was a part of the trench. But, as it was in respect of the ditch or drain that defendant was found negligent, and plaintiff was held not to have assumed the risk, and as that only was considered by the lower courts, the judgment cannot be affirmed on the theory that plaintiff was not injured there, but at another place.\n Three or four days after the accident, plaintiff went to the yard to get his pay and then told the coal chute foreman of the accident, saying he 'fell down in the ditch somewhere off an engine.' He also indicated to the roundhouse foreman, not the exact spot, but the vicinity of the place where he claimed to have been injured. The part of the yard so pointed out includes the section of the drain here in question.\n In his testimony plaintiff described the accident in substance as follows: He went upon an engine standing near the roundhouse and rode it to a point about 60 feet from the coal chute, where it stopped near a switch he intended to turn. The engine step was between 3 and 4 feet above the general level of the ground between the tracks. He said he jumped from the engine and 'just struck a certain hole'; that there was coal or stone in the hole; 'there was something there very hard'; that he immediately became unconscious, and did not know what happened, or who took him 'out of that hole, or how they took' him. He also said that he did not know about the hole before he jumped; that it was so dark that he could not see the hole; that he thought everything was level, and did not expect the hole to be in that place. There is nothing to support a finding that there was then any hole or depression in the yard, other than the open drain.\n The Federal Employers' Liability Act permits recovery upon the basis of negligence only. The carrier is not liable to its employees because of any defect or insufficiency in plant or equipment that is not attributable to negli- \n\n[279 U.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n gence. The burden was on plaintiff to adduce reasonable evidence to show a breach of duty owed by defendant to him in respect of the place where he was injured, and that in whole or in part his injuries resulted proximately therefrom. And, except as provided in section 4 of the act, the employee assumes the ordinary risks of his employment; and, when obvious or fully known and appreciated, he assumes the extraordinary risks and those due to negligence of his employer and fellow employees. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1; St. Louis, etc., Ry. v. Mills, \n271 \nU.S. 344\n, 46 S. Ct. 520; Northern Ry. Co. v. Page, \n274 \nU.S. 65, 75\n, 47 S. Ct. 491.\n The record contains no description of the place where plaintiff was injured other than that above referred to. Fault or negligence may not be found from the mere existence of the drain and the happening of the accident. The measure of duty owed by defendant to plaintiff was reasonable or ordinary care having regard to the circumstances. Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658, 664\n, 21 S. Ct. 75. There is no evidence that the open drain was not suitable or appropriate for the purpose for which it was maintained or that there was in use by defendant or other carriers any means for the drainage of railroad yards which involve less of danger to switchmen and others employed therein. Defendant was not bound to maintain its yard in the best or safest condition; it had much freedom in the selection of methods to drain its yard and in the choice of facilities and places for the use of its employees. Courts will not prescribe standards in respect of such matters or leave engineering questions such as are involved in the construction and maintenance of railroad yards and the drainage systems therein to the uncretain and varying judgment of juries. Toledo, St. L. & W. R. Co. v. Allen, \n276 \nU.S. 165, 170\n, 48 S. Ct. 215. The evidence is not sufficient to warrant a finding that defendant was guilty of any breach of duty owed to plaintiff in respect \n\n[279 U.S. 7, 12]\n\u00a0\n of the method employed or the condition of the drain at the time and place in question.

Ct. 177.\n The court takes judicial notice of the fact that for some weeks immediately before the accident the sun rose and it was light for some time before plaintiff's quitting hour. Montenes v. Metropolitan Street R. Co., 77 App. Div. 493, 78 N. Y. S. 1059. He worked in daylight for some time every morning during the spring and summer months, and during one year he worked days. There was nothing obscure or of recent origin about the place where he was injured. The conditions were constant and of long standing. The evidence requires a finding that he had long known the location of the drain and its condition at the place in question. The dangers attending jumping from engines in the vicinity of the drain, especially in the dark, were obvious. Plaintiff must be held to have fully understood and appreciated the risk.\n It was the duty of the judge presiding at the trial to direct the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant.

Gen., of New York, amicus curiae, by special leave of court.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit under the Employers' Liability Act for personal injuries. The injuries were inflicted in Connecticut, the plaintiff, the petitioner, is a citizen and resident of Connecticut, and the defendant, the respondent, is a Connecticut corporation, although doing business in New York where the suit was brought. Upon motion the trial court dismissed the action, assuming that the statutes of the State gave it a discretion in the matter, and its action was affirmed by the Appellate Division, 223 App. Div. 782, 227 N. Y. S. 797, and by the Court of Appeals, 248 N. Y. 580, 162 N. E. 532. Thus it is established that the statute purports to give to the Court the power that it exercised. But the plaintiff says that the Act as construed is void under article 4,  2, of the Constitution of the United States: 'The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.' A subordinate argument is added that the jurisdiction is imposed by the Employers' Liability Act when as here the Court has authority to entertain the suit. Code title 45,  56 (45 USCA  56); Acts of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  6, 35 Stat. 66, April 5, 1910, c. 143,  1, 36 Stat. 291. That section gives concurrent jurisdiction to the Courts of the United States and the States and forbids removal if the suit is brought in a State Court.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 377, 386]\n\u00a0\n The language of the New York statute, Laws of 1913, c. 60, amending section 1780 or the Code of Civil Procedure is: 'An action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by another foreign corporation, or by a non-resident, in one of the following cases only: ... 4. Where a foreign corporation is doing business within this State.' Laws of 1920, c. 916,  47. The argument for the petitioner is that, construed as it is, it makes a discrimination between citizens of New York and citizens of other States, because it authorizes the Court in its discretion to dismiss an action by a citizen of another State but not an action brought by a citizen of New York, which last it cannot do. Gregonis v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 235 N. Y. 152, 139 N. E. 223, 32 A. L. R. 1. It is said that a citizen of New York is a resident of New York wherever he may be living in fact, and thus that all citizens of New York can bring these actions, whereas citizens of other States cannot unless they are actually living in the State. But however often the word resident may have been used as equivalent to citizen, and for whatever purposes residence may have been assumed to follow citizenship there is nothing to prohibit the legislature from using 'resident' in the strict primary sense of one actually living in the place for the time, irrespective even of domicile. If that word in this statute must be so construed in order to uphold the act or even to avoid serious doubts of its constitutionality we presume that the Courts of New York would construe it in that way; as indeed the Supreme Court has done already in so many words. Adams v. Penn Bank of Pittsburgh, 35 Hun (N. Y.) 393; Duquesne Club v. Penn Bank of Pittsburgh, 35 Hun (N. Y.) 390; Robinson v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 112 N. Y. 315, 324, 19 N. E. 625, 2 L. R. A. 636; Klotz v. Angle, 220 N. Y. 347, 358, 116 N. E. 24. See Canadian Northern seems to be assumed in Gregonis v. Philadelphia Ct. 402. The same meaning seems to be assumed in Gregoins \n\n[279 U.S. 377, 387]\n\u00a0\n v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 235 N. Y. 152, 139 N. E. 223, 32 A. L. R. 1. We cannot presume, against this evidence and in order to overthrow a statute, that the Courts of New York would adopt a different rule from that which is well settled here. Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S. Ct. 391.\n Construed as it has been and we believe will be construed the statute applies to citizens of New York as well as to others and puts them on the same footing. There is no discrimination between citizens as such, and none between nonresidents with regard to these foreign causes of action. A distinction of privileges according to residence may be based upon rational considerations and has been upheld by this Court, emphasizing the difference between citizenship and residence, in La Tourette v. McMaster, \n248 \nU.S. 465\n, 39 S. Ct. 160. Followed in Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 539\n, 40 S. Ct. 2. It is true that in Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 247\n, 19 S. Ct. 165, 'residents' was taken to mean citizens in a Tennessee statute of a wholly different scope, but whatever else may be said of the argument in that opinion ( compare page 262, 172 U. S. (19 S. Ct. 165)), it cannot prevail over the later decision in La Tourette v. McMaster, and the plain intimations of the New York cases to which we have referred. There are manifest reasons for preferring residents in access to often overcrowded Courts, both in convenience and in the fact that broadly speaking it is they who pay for maintaining the Courts concerned.\n As to the grant of jurisdiction in the Employers' Liability Act that statute does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it but only to empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the United States is concerned. It may very well be that if the Supreme Court of New York were given no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would be subject to a \n\n[279 U.S. 377, 388]\n\u00a0\n duty. But there is nothing in the Act of Congress that purports to force a duty upon such Courts as against an otherwise valid excuse. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 57 S., 32 S.

Richardson, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Robert P. Reeder, Sp. Asst. to Atty.

S. C. (19 USCA  174-180). A rule to show cause was issued; return was made to the rule; and a hearing has been had on the petition and return.\n Section 316 of the Tariff Act is long and not happily drafted. A summary of it will suffice for present purposes. It is designed to protect domestic industry and trade against 'unfair methods of competition and unfair acts' in the importation of articles into the United States and in their sale after importation. To that end it empowers the President, whenever the existence of any such unfair methods or acts is established to his satisfaction, to deal with them by fixing an additional duty upon the importation of the articles to which the unfair practice relates, or, if he is satisfied the unfairness is extreme, by directing that the articles be excluded from entry.\n The section provides that, 'to assist the President' in making decisions thereunder, the Tariff Commission shall investigate allegations of unfair practice, conduct hearings, receive evidence, and make findings and recommendations, subject to a right in the importer or con- \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 447]\n\u00a0\n signee, if the findings be against him, to appeal to the Court of Customs Appeals on questions of law affecting the findings. There is also a provision purporting to subject the decision of that court to review by this Court upon certiorari. Ultimately the commission is required to transmit its findings and recommendations, with a transcript of the evidence, to the President, so that he may consider the matter and act thereon.\n A further provision declares that 'any additional duty or any refusal of entry under this section shall continue in effect until the President shall find and instruct the Secretary of the Treasury that the conditions which led to the assessment of such additional duty or refusal of entry no longer exist.'\n The present petitioner, the Bakelite Corporation, desiring to invoke action under that section, filed with the Tariff Commission a sworn complaint charging unfair methods and acts in the importation and subsequent sale of certain articles and alleging a resulting injury to its domestic business of manufacturing and selling similar articles. The Commission entertained the complaint, gave public notice thereof and conducted a hearing, in which interested importers appeared and presented evidence claimed to be in refutation of the charge. The Commission made findings sustaining the charge, and recommended that the articles to which the unfair practice relates be excluded from entry. The importers appealed to the Court of Customs Appeals, where the Bakelite Corporation challenged the court's jurisdiction on constitutional grounds. The court upheld its jurisdiction and announced its purpose to entertain the appeal. Thereupon the Bakelite Corporation presented to this Court its petition for a writ of prohibition. Pending a decision on the petition further proceedings on the appeal have been suspended. \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 448]\n\u00a0\n The grounds on which the jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals was challenged in that court, and on which a writ of prohibition is sought here, are:\n\n\n (1)\n That the Court of Customs Appeals is an inferior court created by Congress under section 1 of article 3 of the Constitution, and as such it can have no jurisdiction of any proceeding which is not a case or controversy within the meaning of section 2 of the same article.\n\n\n (2)\n That the proceeding presented by the appeal from the Tariff Commission is not a case or controversy in the sense of that section, but is merely an advisory proceeding in aid of executive action.\n The Court of Customs Appeals considered these grounds in the order just stated, and by its ruling sustained the first and rejected the second. 16 Ct. Cust. App. 378, 53 Treasury Decisions, 716.\n In this Court counsel have addressed arguments, not only to the two questions bearing on the jurisdiction of the Court of Customs Appeals, but also to the question whether, if that court be exceeding its jurisdiction, this Court has power to issue to it a writ of prohibition to arrest the unauthorized proceedings.\n The power of this Court to issue writs of prohibition never has been clearly defined by statute1 or by decisions. \n2\n And the existence of the power in a situation like the present is not free from doubt. But the doubt need not be resolved now, for, assuming that the power exists, there is here, as will appear later on, no tenable basis for exercising it. In such a case it is admissible, and is common practice, to pass the question of power and to deny the writ because without warrant in other respects. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 438, 449]\n\u00a0\n While article 3 of the Constitution declares, in section 1, that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in 'such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,' and prescribes, in section 2, that this power shall extend to cases and controversies of certain enumerated classes, it long has been settled that article 3 does not express the full authority of Congress to create courts, and that other articles invest Congress with powers in the exertion of which it may create inferior courts and clothe them with functions deemed essential or helpful in carrying those powers into execution. But there is a difference between the two classes of courts. Those established under the specific power given in section 2 of article 3 are called constitutional courts. They share in the exercise of the judicial power defined in that section, can be invested with no other jurisdiction, and have judges who hold office during good behavior, with no power in Congress to provide otherwise. On the other hand, those created by Congress in the exertion of other powers are called legislative courts. Their functions always are directed to the execution of one or more of such powers, and are prescribed by Congress independently of section 2 of article 3; and their judges hold for such term as Congress prescribes, whether it be a fixed period of years or during good behavior.\n The first pronouncement on the subject by this Court was in American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, where the status and jurisdiction of courts created by Congress for the Territory of Florida were drawn in ques- \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 450]\n\u00a0\n tion. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said (page 546):\n'These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States.'\n\n That ruling has been accepted and applied from that time to the present in cases relating to territorial courts. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n A like view has been taken of the status and jurisdiction of the courts provided by Congress for the District of Columbia. These courts, this Court has held, are created in virtue of the power of Congress 'to exercise exclusive legislation' over the district made the seat of the government of the United States, are legislative rather than constitutional courts, and may be clothed with the authority and charged with the duty of giving advisory decisions in proceedings which are not cases or controversies within the meaning of article 3, but are merely in aid of legislative or executive action, and therefore outside the admissible jurisdiction of courts established under that article. 5 \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 451]\n\u00a0\n The United States Court for China and the consular courts are legislative courts created as a means of carrying into effect powers conferred by the Constitution respecting treaties and commerce with foreign countries. They exercise their functions within particular districts in foreign territory, and are invested with a large measure of jurisdiction over American citizens in those districts. \n6\n The authority of Congress to create them and to clothe them with such jurisdiction has been upheld by this Court and is well recognized. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Legislative courts also may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it. The mode of determining matters of this class is completely within congressional control. Congress may reserve to itself the power to decide, may delegate that power to executive officers, or may commit it to judicial tribunals. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 438, 452]\n\u00a0\n Conspicuous among such matters are claims against the United States. These may arise in many ways and may be for money, lands, or other things. They all admit of legislative or executive determination, ana yet from their nature are susceptible of determination by courts; but no court can have cognizance of them except as Congress makes specific provision therefor. Nor do claimants have any right to sue on them unless Congress consents; and Congress may attach to its consent such conditions as it deems proper, even to requiring that the suits be brought in a legislative court specially created to consider them. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n The Court of Claims is such a court. It was created, and has been maintained, as a special tribunal to examine and determine claims for money against the United States. This is a function which belongs primarily to Congress as an incident of its power to pay the debts of the United States. But the function is one which Congress has a discretion either to exercise directly or to delegate to other agencies.\n For 65 years following the adoption of the Constitution Congress made it a practice, not only to determine various claims itself, but also to commit the determination of many to the executive departments. In time, as claims multiplied, that practice subjected Congress and those departments to a heavy burden. To lessen that burden Congress created the Court of Claims and delegated to it the examination and determination of all claims within stated classes. \n10\n Other claims have since been included in the delegation, and some have been excluded. But the court is still what Congress at the outset declared it \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 453]\n\u00a0\n should be-'a court for the investigation of claims against the United States.' The matters made cognizable therein include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination. On the contrary, all are matters which are susceptible of legislative or executive determination and can have no other save under and in conformity with permissive legislation by Congress.\n The nature of the proceedings in the Court of Claims and the power of Congress over them are illustrated in McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n, where particular attention was given to the statutory provisions authorizing that court, when passing on claims against the government, to consider and determine any asserted set-offs or counterclaims, and directing that all issues of fact be tried by the court without a jury. The claimant in that case objected that these provisions were in conflict with the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, which preserves the right of trial by jury in suits at common law where the value in controversy exceeds $20. This Court disposed of the objection by saying (page 440):\n'There is nothing in these provisions which violates either the letter or spirit of the Seventh Amendment. Suits against the government in the Court of Claims, whether reference be had to the claimant's demand, or to the defence, or to any set-off, or counterclaim which the government may assert, are not controlled by the Seventh Amendment. They are not suits at common law within its true meaning. The government cannot be sued, except with its own consent. It can declare in what court it may be sued, and prescribe the forms of pleading and the rules of practice to be observed in such suits. It may restrict the jurisdiction of the court to a consideration of only certain classes of claims against the United States. Congress, by the act in question, informs the claimant that if he avails himself of the privilege of suing the \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 454]\n\u00a0\n government in the special court organized for that purpose, he may be met with a set-off, counter-claim, or other demand of the government, upon which judgment may go against him, without the intervention of a jury, if the court, upon the whole case, is of opinion that the government is entitled to such judgment. If the claimant avails himself of the privilege thus granted, he must do so subject to the conditions annexed by the government to the exercise of the privilege.'\n\n While what has been said of the creation and special function of the court definitely reflects its status as a legislative court, there is propriety in mentioning the fact that Congress always has treated it as having that status. From the outset Congress has required it to give merely advisory decisions on many matters. Under the act creating it all of its decisions were to be of that nature. \n11\n Afterwards some were to have effect as binding judgments, but others were still to be merely advisory. 12 This is true at the present time. \n13\n A duty to give decisions which are advisory only, and so without force as judicial judgments, may be laid on a legislative court, but not on a constitutional court established under article 3.14\n In Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, Append., and again in Re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222\n, 13 S. Ct. 577, this Court plainly was of opinion that the Court of Claims is a legislative court \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 455]\n\u00a0\n specially created to consider claims for money against the United States, and on that basis distinctly recognized that Congress may require it to give advisory decisions. And in United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 144- 145, this Court described it as having all the functions of a court, but being, as respects its organization and existence, undoubtedly and completely under the control of Congress.\n In the present case the court below regarded the recent decision in Miles v. Graham, \n268 \nU.S. 501\n, 45 S. Ct. 601, as disapproving what was said in the cases just cited, and holding that the Court of Claims is a constitutional rather than a legislative court. But in this Miles v. Graham was taken too broadly. The opinion therein contains no mention of the cases supposed to have been disapproved; nor does it show that this Court's attention was drawn to the question whether that court is a statutory court or a constitutional court. In fact, as appears from the briefs, that question was not mooted. Such as were mooted were considered and determined in the opinion. Certainly the decision is not to be taken in this case as disturbing the earlier rulings or attributing to the Court of Claims a changed status. Webster v. Fall, \n266 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 45 S. Ct. 148.\n That court was said to be a constitutional court in United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n98 \nU.S. 569, 602\n, 603 S.; but this statement was purely an obiter dictum, because the question whether the Court of Claims is a constitutional court or a legislative court was in no way involved. And any weight the dictum, as such, might have is more than overcome by what has been said on the question in other cases where there was need for considering it.\n Without doubt that court is a court of the United States within the meaning of section 375 of title 28, U. S. C. (28 USCA  375)15 just as the superior courts of the District of Columbia are;16 but this does not make it a constitutional court. \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 456]\n\u00a0\n The authority to create legislative courts finds illustration also in the late Court of Private Land Claims. It was created in virtue of the power of Congress over the fulfillment of treaty stipulations; and its special function was that of hearing and finally determining claims founded on Spanish or Mexican grants, concessions, etc., and embracing lands within the territory ceded by Mexico to the United States and subsequently included within the Territories or New Mexico, Arizona and Utah and the States of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming. \n17\n By the treaties of cession the United States was obligated to inquire into private claims to lands within the ceded territory and to respect inviolably those that were valid. Congress at first intrusted the preliminary inquiry to executive officers and required that they make reports whereon it could make the ultimate determinations. This was an admissible mode of dealing with the subject, and many claims were finally determined under it. 18 But later on Congress created the Court of Private Land Claims and charged it with the duty of examining and adjudicating, as between claimants and the United States, all claims not already determined. In United States v. Coe, \n155 \nU.S. 76\n, 15 S. Ct. 16, that court was held to be a legislative court, and the validity of the act creating it was sustained. And, while that case related to lands in a territory, there can be no real doubt that the same rule would apply were the lands in a state. The obligation of the United States would be the same in either case, and Congress would have the same discretion respecting the mode of fulfilling it. \n19\n In fact, the act creating the court included within its jurisdiction all claims within three states as well as those within three territories, and the court adjudicated \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 457]\n\u00a0\n all within these limits that were brought before it within the periods fixed by Congress.\n The Choctaw and Chickasaw Citizenship Court was another legislative court. It was created to hear and determine controverted claims to membership in two Indian tribes. The tribes were under the guardianship of the United States, which in virtue of that relation was proceeding to distribute the lands and funds of the tribes among their members. How the membership should be determined rested in the discretion of Congress. It could commit the task to officers of the department in charge of Indian affairs, to a commission, or to a judicial tribunal. As the controversies were difficult of solution and large properties were to be distributed, Congress chose to create a special court and to authorize it to determine the controversies. In Wallace v. Adams, \n204 \nU.S. 415\n, 27 S. Ct. 363, this was held to be a valid exertion of authority belonging to Congress by reason of its control over the Indian tribes. And it is of significance here that in so ruling this Court approvingly cited and gave effect to the opinion of Chief Justice Taney in Gordon v. United States respecting the status of the Court of Claims.\n Before we turn to the status of the Court of Customs Appeals it will be helpful to refer briefly to the Customs Court. Formerly it was the Board of General Appraisers. Congress assumed to make the board a court by changing its name. There was no change in powers, duties, or personnel. \n20\n The board was an executive agency charged with the duty of reviewing acts of appraisers and collectors in appraising and classifying imports and in liquidating and collecting customs duties. \n21\n But its functions, \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 458]\n\u00a0\n although mostly quasi judicial, were all susceptible of performance by executive officers, and had been performed by such officers in earlier times.\n The Court of Customs Appeals was created by Congress in virtue of its power to lay and collect duties on imports and to adopt any appropriate means of carrying that power into execution. \n22\n The full province of the court under the act creating it is that of determining matters arising between the government and others in the executive administration and application of the customs laws. These matters are brought before it by appeals from decisions of the Customs Court, formerly called to Board of General Appraisers. \n23\n The appeals include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination, but only matters the determination of which may be, and at times has been, committed exclusively to executive officers. True, the provisions of the customs laws requiring duties to be paid and turned into the treasury promptly, without awaiting disposal of protests against rulings of appraisers and collectors, operate in many instances to convert the protests into applications to refund part or all of the money paid;24 but this does not make the matters involved in the protests any the less susceptible of determination by executive officers. \n25\n In fact, their final determination has been at times confided to the Secretary of the Treasury, with no recourse to judicial proceedings. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n This summary of the court's province as a special tribunal, of the matters subjected to its revisory authority, \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 459]\n\u00a0\n and of its relation to the executive administration of the customs laws, shows very plainly that it is a legislative and not a constitutional court.\n Some features of the act creating it are referred to in the opinion below as requiring a different conclusion; but, when rightly understood, they cannot be so regarded.\n A feature much stressed is the absence of any provision respecting the tenure of the judges. From this it is argued that Congress intended the court to be a constitutional one, the judges of which would hold their offices during good behavior. And in support of the argument it is said that in creating courts Congress has made it a practice to distinguish between those intended to be constitutional and those intended to be legislative by making no provision respecting the tenure of judges of the former and expressly fixing the tenure of judges of the latter. But the argument is fallacious. It mistakenly assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there been any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives special significance to the absence or presence of a provision respecting the tenure of judges. This may be illustrated by two citations. The same Congress that created the Court of Customs Appeals made provision for five additional circuit judges, and declared that they should hold their offices during good behavior;27 and yet the status of the judges was the same as it would have been had that declaration been omitted. In creating courts for some of the territories, Congress failed to include a provision fixing the tenure of the judges;28 but \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 460]\n\u00a0\n the courts became legislative courts just as if such a provision had been included.\n Another feature much stressed is a provision purporting to authorize temporary assignments of circuit and district judges to the Court of Customs Appeals when vacancies occur in its membership or when any of its members are disqualified or otherwise unable to act. This, it is said, shows that Congress intended the court to be a constitutional one, for otherwise such assignments would be inadmissible under the Constitution. But, if there be constitutional obstacles to assigning judges of constitutional courts to legislative courts, the provision cited is for that reason invalid, and cannot be saved on the theory that Congress intended the court to be in one class when under the Constitution it belongs in another. Besides, the inference sought to be drawn from that provision is effectually refuted by two later enactments-one permitting judges of that court to be assigned from time to time to the superior courts of the District of Columbia,29 which are legislative courts, and the other transferring to that court the advisory jurisdiction in respect of appeals from the Patent Office which formerly was vested in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. \n30\n\u00a0\n\n Another feature to which attention was given is the denomination of the court as a United States court. That the court is a court of the United States is plain; but this is quite consistent with its being a legislative court.\n As it is plain that the Court of Customs Appeals is a legislative and not a constitutional court, there is no need for now inquiring whether the proceeding under section 316 of the Tariff Act of 1922, now pending before it, is a case of controversy within the meaning of section 2 of article \n\n[279 U.S. 438, 461]\n\u00a0\n 3 of the Constitution, for this section applies only to constitutional courts. Even if the proceeding is not such a case or controversy, the Court of Customs Appeals, being a legislative court, may be invested with jurisdiction of it, as is done by section 316.\n Of course, a writ of prohibition does not lie to a court which is proceeding within the limits of its jurisdiction, as the Court of Customs Appeals appears to be doing in this instance.\n Prohibition denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Rev.

Gunn, of Helena, Mont., and Dennis F. Lyons, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioners.\n Messrs. L. A. Foot and Francis A. Silver, both of Helena, Mont., for respondents.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus. A rule to show cause was issued and a return has now been made to the rule. From the petition and the return the facts are shown to be as follows: The Northern Pacific Railway Company and three others brought a suit in the District Court for the District of Montana against the Board of Railroad Commissioners of that state and others to prevent the enforcement of a rate order made by the board, the objection urged against the order being that it was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and with certain provisions of the commerce laws of Congress. The plaintiffs applied for a temporary restraining order and for an interlocutory injunction. District Judge Pray granted a temporary restraining order which was to continue in force 'until the plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction be heard and determined by three judges as provided by statute.' Afterwards, but before three judges were assembled to hear the application for an in \n\n[280 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n terlocutory injunction, District Judge Bourquin, sitting alone, entertained a motion by the defendants to dissolve the temporary restraining order, and also a motion to dismiss the bill on the merits. The plaintiffs objected that a single judge was without authority to entertain or act upon either motion, but Judge Bourquin overruled the objection, sustained the motion to dismiss and entered a final decree of dismissal. Of course, the decree, if valid, operated not only as a revocation of the temporary restraining order, but also as a denial of the application for an interlocutory injunction.\n Manifestly the suit was within the terms and spirit of section 380, Title 28, of the United States Code (28 USCA  380). When Judge Pray granted a temporary restraining order to be effective until the application for an interlocutory injunction should be heard and determined, it became his duty under that section immediately to call two other judges, one of whom should be either a circuit justice or a circuit judge, to assist him in hearing and determining the application for an interlocutory injunction. Not only so, but the section as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 938 (28 USCA  380), extends the requirement respecting the presence of three judges to the final hearing in such a suit. Under our decisions construing and applying the section, Judge Bourquin sitting alone was without jurisdiction to hear either the motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order or the motion to dismiss the bill on the merits. In the presence of the application for an interlocutory injunction-which was at no time withdrawn but constantly pressed-a single judge, whether Judge Pray or Judge Bourquin, was as much without authority to dismiss the bill on the merits as he would be to grant either an interlocutory or a permanent injunction. Our decisions leave no doubt on these points. Ex parte Metropolitan Water Co. of West Virginia, \n220 \nU.S. 539\n, 31 S.

Ct. 478.\n It follows that the rule against the respondents must be made absolute with directions to them to vacate the decree of dismissal entered by Judge Bourquin and to take immediate steps for assembling a court of three judges to hear and determine the application for an interlocutory injunction conformably to section 380. We assume it will not be necessary to issue a formal writ.\n Rule made absolute. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For order that mandamus issue, see \n280 \nU.S. 530\n, 50 S. Ct. 157, 74 L.

BANK OF WORCESTER(1929)\nNo. 469\nArgued: April 11, 1929Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 347, 348]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Newton D. Baker and Benjamin F. Fiery, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 347, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. Delano Putnam, of Boston, Mass., for Commonwealth of massachusetts.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 347, 353]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinon of the Court.\n The Worcester County National Bank is a consolidated banking corporation, formed by uniting, on June 27, 1927, the Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company, a state institution of Massachusetts, and the Merchants' National Bank of Worcester, a national bank of Worcester county, massachusetts, under the Act of Congress of February 25, 1927, c. 191, 44 Stat. 1224, amending the Act of November 7, 1918, c. 209, 40 Stat. 1044 ( 12 USCA  34a). The amendment added a new section (3), and this case turns chiefly on the construction, effect, and validity of that new section.\n The consolidated bank filed in the probate court of Worcester county a first and final account of the Fitch- \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 354]\n\u00a0\n burg Bank & Trust Company, executor of the last will and testament of Julia A. Legnard, late of Fitchburg in the county of Worcester. The account was for the period beginning April 21, 1926, and ending February 9, 1928. The account was rendered by the Worcester County National Bank for the Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company to June 27, 1927, and thereafter as its own account.\n The Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company had been appointed by the probate court executor of the will of Julia A. Legnard on April 21, 1926, and qualified by giving bond approved on that day.\n The consolidated bank claimed that, in view of the proceedings, its right and duty was to render the account presented for allowance, and, as all the parties interested had assented to it, that it should be allowed by the court.\n The probate court found that the account was in proper form for allowance, and should be allowed as rendered, if the said Worcester County National Bank, as successor or otherwise, was executor of said will or had the right to render the account.\n The probate judge reported a certificate from the Comptroller of the Currency that the two banks had complied with all the provisions of the acts of Congress and had been consolidated under the charter of the Merchants' National Bank, with the capital stock of $1,875,000, that the consolidation had been approved, and that pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act, enacted December 23, 1913,  11(k), c. 6, 38 Stat. 251, 262 (12 USCA  248(k), the consolidated bank had permission to act as executor.\n He further reported that many estates were being administered by the consolidated bank under a claim of right where the Fitchburg Bank had been appointed administrator, executor or in some other fiduciary capacity, and no new appointment of the consolidated bank in place of the Fitchburg Bank had been made by decree of the probate court. \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 355]\n\u00a0\n He concluded the report as follows:\n'Without action upon said account, I report the above facts and the question of law involved, for the consideration and determination of the full court, as to whether the petitioner is entitled to render said account.\n\n'Fredk. H. Chamberlain,\n\n'Judge of Probate Court.'\n\n After a hearing on the report, a rescript of the Supreme Judicial Court was as follows:\n'Ordered that the register of probate and insolvency in said county make the following entry under said case in the docket of said court, viz.: The question reported, namely, 'Whether the petitioner is entitled to render said account,' is answered in the negative. Probate court instructed accordingly.'\n\n Following the rescript, the probate court made the following entry:\n'The foregoing account having been presented for allowance, after rescript from the Supreme Judicial Court (full court) and pursuant to the terms of said rescript, it appearing that the Worcester County National Bank of Worcester, the accountant and petitioner in this case, has not succeeded the Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company as executor of the will of said testatrix and is not entitled to render this account, this petition for the allowance of the same is hereby dismissed.'\n\n A petition for appeal to this court, with an assignment of errors, was filed, and an appeal was allowed under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937 (28 USCA  344).\n The Supreme Judicial Court stated its reasons for the conclusion reached in an elaborate opinion. (Mass.) 162 N. E. 217.\n The Court began with a statement of the substance of section 3 of the Act of February 25, 1927, c. 191, 44 Stat. 1224, 1225, providing that any bank, including a trust company \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 356]\n\u00a0\n incorporated under the laws of any state, may be consolidated with a national bank located in the same county under the charter of the national bank, on such terms and conditions as may lawfully be agreed upon in the manner specified; that all the rights, franchises, and interests of the state bank in and to every species of property, real, personal, and mixed, and choses in action thereto belonging, shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in such national bank into which it is consolidated, without any deed or transfer; and that the national bank shall hold and enjoy all this property, franchises, and interests, including the right of succession as trustee, executor, or in any other fiduciary capacity, in the same manner and to the same extent as was held and enjoyed by the state bank. The section closes with the limitation: 'No such consolidation shall be in contravention of the law of the state under which such bank is incorporated.'\n The court examined the question whether there was any statute of Massachusetts or any policy declared in its statutes which prevented or forbade such consolidation, and found that there was none, but pointed out that there was a provision in the General Laws of Massachusetts, c. 172,  44, as amended by Stat. 1922, c. 292, which should be regarded as a limitation upon such consolidation, as follows:\n'The charter of a trust company, the business of which shall, on or after July 1, 1922, be consolidated or merged with, or absorbed by, another bank or trust company, shall be void except for the purpose of discharging existing obligations and liabilities.'\n\n With this qualification, the court found the field to be left open, under Massachusetts law, to the exercise by Congress of whatever power it possessed over the subject. The court then considered the congressional power, and cited the case of Casey v. Galli, \n94 U.S. 673\n, to show that \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 357]\n\u00a0\n under section 44 of the Banking Act of Congress, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 112 ( 12 USCA  35), a state bank could change its organization into that of a national bank without any authority given by the state in its charter or otherwise to make the change. The Supreme Judicial Court could not find any distinction between the power of Congress to authorize the conversion of a state bank into a national bank and its power to authorize the consolidation of a state bank with a national bank under the charter of the national bank, and concluded that, if no state legislation was necessary to accomplish the conversion, there was no legislation necessary to accomplish consolidation, and that the consolidation of a Massachusetts trust company with a national bank under the section 3 of the Act of Congress of February 25, 1927, was permissible and valid.\n The court then considered what was the legal effect of the consolidation on the trust company and the national bank, and emphasized the explicit provision of section 3 that the consolidation was to be under the charter of the national bank. It referred again to the provision of the state law that upon the consolidation, the charter of the trust company should be 'void except for the purpose of discharging existing obligations and liabilities.' It held that the word 'franchises' directed to be transferred to the national bank by virtue of section 3 did not mean its charter or its right to be a corporation, for that would be in contravention of the law of the commonwealth; that it was only the national bank that retained its corporate identity; that the certificate of the Comptroller did not constitute a charter; but only his approval of the consolidation; that the trust company had gone out of existence and all its property had become the property of the consolidated bank; and that the latter was not a newly-created organization, but an enlargement of the continuously existing national bank. Thus the court found that the \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 358]\n\u00a0\n identity of the trust company had not been continued in a national bank, but had been extinguished. The court distinguished this case from cases of union, where contract obligations had been held to pass from one of the uniting corporations to the other. Such cases were held not to be applicable to sustain the view that positions of trust, like executor, administrator, and other fiduciaries, could be transferred to the national bank by the mere consolidation under Massachusetts law.\n The court then set out at some length the reasons why under the Constitution and practice of Massachusetts the appointment of an executor was a judicial act and that in the case before the court no one could succeed to the void and defunct state trust company as executor, except by appointment by the probate court. The trust involved was highly personal. The court said:\n'To treat the national banking association into which the state trust company has been consolidated as preserving the identity of the trust company in this particular would be contrary to the juridical conception and practice touching the appointment of such fiduciaries under the law of this commonwealth.'\n\n The third question the court discussed and decided was the validity and binding effect on courts of Massachusetts of the declaration in section 3 of the act of Congress that the right of succession as trustee, executor, or in any other fiduciary capacity, would follow to the same extent as it was held and enjoyed by such state bank. It first inquired what was its meaning, and held that it meant that the original appointment of the state bank was to continue wholly unaffected by the fact that the state bank had ceased to be, and that another and different corporation, whose credit, standing, and competency had never been the subject of judicial inquiry for this purpose, must be substituted by virtue of section 3. The court found that \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 359]\n\u00a0\n this result was in contravention of the law of the commonwealth and contrary to the state and federal Constitutions.\n The court found, however, that this provision was not the dominant part of section 3, that the clause was separable and distinct, that the rest of the section could stand independently, and that there was no such connection between the two as to indicate that Congress would not have enacted the valid part without the other.\n The court, therefore, held that the Worcester County National Bank of Worcester, the accountant and petitioner in the case at bar, had not succeeded the Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company as executor of the will of the testatrix, and was not entitled to render an account as such executor, that it could only account as executor de son tort, and that the question of the probate court must be answered in the negative.\n In passing on this appeal, we must observe that, in determining the policy of a state from its statutes and their construction, we of course follow the opinion of the state court, except as it may be affected by the federal Constitution. When, therefore, the state court holds that an executor, to act as such in the state, must be appointed by the probate court, this court must respect that conclusion and act accordingly; but, when the question arises as to what is the proper interpretation and construction of federal legislation, this court adopts its own view.\n It is very clear to us that Congress, in the enactment of section 3 of the Act of February 25, 1927, was anxious even to the point of repetition to show that it wished to avoid any provision in contravention of the law of the state in which the state trust company and the national bank to be consolidated were located. So strongly manifest is this purpose that we do not hesitate to construe the effect of section 3 in Massachusetts to be only to transfer the property \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 360]\n\u00a0\n and estate from the trust company to the national bank to be managed and preserved as the state law provides, for administration of estates, and not to transfer the office of executor from the state trust company to the succeeding national bank. As this requires another judicial appointment by a probate court, it would become the duty of a consolidated national bank, after the union, immediately to apply for the appointment of itself as administrator, subject to the examination and approval of the proper probate court. Because of the interest of the national bank in all of the assets of the trust company, including the estate at bar, transferred to its custody, the bank would seem to have a right to make such an application to the probate court and await the action of that court. If, on the other hand, it assumed improperly that it was made an executor by the mere consolidation, and held the transferred property as such, it must be held to have become an executor be son tort and should bring the assets before the probate court and proceed by proper application to secure the appointment of a legal executor by the court, as pointed out by the Supreme Judicial Court in this case and in Commonwealth-Atlantic National Bank, 261 Mass. 217, 158 N. E. 780, and Commonwealth-Atlantic National Bank, 249 Mass. 440, 144 N. E. 443.\n These views lead us to agree with the conclusions of the Supreme Judicial Court in respect to the legality of the consolidation of the trust company and the national bank, and only to differ from it in its construction of section 3, by which it would hold that section unconstitutional under the Construction of Massachusetts, and also under the Constitution of the United States.\n We think section 3 enjoins upon the national bank complete conformity with the Massachusetts law in its conduct of estates of deceased persons when acting as trustee or administrator thereof. \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 361]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Judicial Court refers in its opinion in this case to that of Commonwealth-Atlantic National Bank of Boston, 261 Mass. 217, 158 N. E. 780, as showing that the consolidated bank in this case could not act as executor. In that case a state trust company was appointed by the probate court as trustee under wills in two cases and as conservator of property in a third. It qualified by giving bond, and for some time held and administered the property as fiduciary. Thereafter it was converted into a national bank, which still later was consolidated with another national bank. No new appointment as trustee was made by the probate court. The consolidated national bank petitioned for allowance of accounts as fiduciary. The court held that, while the accounts were accurate and complete, the consolidated bank was not a duly appointed fiduciary merely by virtue of the original appointment of the state trust company, and could only account de son tort. The court relied on Commonwealth-Atlantic National Bank of Boston, 249 Mass. 440, 144 N. E. 443. There a state trust company was named as executor in a will. Thereafter it became converted into a national bank, which still later was consolidated with another national bank. The testator having died, the consolidated national bank petitioned for the issuance of letters testamentary to it as the executor named in the will. The court held that it was not the executor named therein, and that the designation of the state trust company as executor did not confer on it a property right passing to its successor, the consolidated national bank.\n The court in both Commonwealth-Atlantic Bank Cases accepted the effect of the decisions in First National Bank of Bay City v. Fellows, \n244 \nU.S. 416\n, 37 S. Ct. 734, L. R. A. 1918C, 283, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1169, and Burnes National Bank of St. Joseph v. Duncan, \n265 \nU.S. 17\n, 44 S. Ct. 427, the latter holding that national banks may act as executors in a state where state trust companies have that privi- \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 362]\n\u00a0\n lege. The court in 249 Mass. said, 'We accept, as we are bound to accept, that principle in all its amplitude and with all its implications,' but said that 'that principle does not reach to the facts here presented.' There was similar language in 261 Mass. The Supreme Judicial Court did not then hold, and has not held, that a probate court of Massachusetts may not appoint a national bank, otherwise qualified, to be executor, administrator, or trustee, if it approves one as such. In construing section 3, we think it to be in conformity therewith for the national bank, after consolidation, to apply to the Massachusetts probate court for appointment as a succeeding fiduciary to carry on the duties. In the present case, no such appointment has been made by the probate court.\n Under the Massachusetts authorities as already cited the bank, in attempting in this case to act as executor, has become an executor de son tort, and that situation must be disposed of in accordance with the laws applicable in Massachusetts to such a situation. Clabburn v. Phillips, 245 Mass. 47, 139 N. E. 498. When the executor de son tort has been released, it would seem that application might be made to the probate court for appointment of the national bank as administrator to close the estate. It seems to us that our construction of section 3 of the act of 1927, in differing from that of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, makes it possible by the appointment of the probate judge, if he approves, to enforce the requirements which the laws of that state impose in the execution of such trusts, and still preserve the constitutional effectiveness of section 3.\n This result requires us to affirm the dismissal of the petition of the Worcester County National Bank in seeking to render the first and final account of the Fitchburg Bank & Trust Company as executor of the last will and \n\n[279 U.S. 347, 363]\n\u00a0\n testament of Julia A. Legnard, deceased, and its own account as executor of her will, but to remand the cause to the probate court for a proceeding by the petitioner as executor de son tort, and for such further proceedings as it may be advised and as are permissible by the laws of Massachusetts and the statutes of the United States not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEXCHANGE TRUST CO. v.

The lands were in drainage district No. 7 of the Poinsett county. Drainage \n\n[278 U.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n district No. 7 had been organized under a special act of the Legislature of Arkansas. Acts Ark. 1917, p. 1053. As originally formed, the district consisted of lands west of the St. Francis river in Poinsett county. Rice and others had their homestead locations in that county east of the St. Francis river. Their lands were flooded by the waters of a drainage district organized in Mississippi county. In order to secure protection against such flood waters, and to secure better drainage to their own lands, they petitioned the county court to allow their lands to be added to drainage district No. 7 of Poinsett county. On March 15, 1918, the petition for annexation of the homestead lands of Rice and others east of the river was acted upon by the county court, and the order of annexation was made. It provided that there should be levied against the lands annexed assessments in accordance with the benefits which the lands should receive from the cost of the drainage. The board of directors of the original drainage district consented to this in open court. On May 24, 1919, the drainage district altered its plans so as to provide for and include in the new assessments the drainage of the territory of the original district on the west side of the river. A judgment was entered reciting the annexation of the lands and the confirmation of it by the General Assembly of Arkansas. Sp. Acts Ark. 1919, p. 52.\n On June 28, 1919, the county court entered a judgment making a modification of the drainage assessments because of the change of plans. It recited that the estimated cost of the entire improvement had been increased to $3,392,000. On June 23, 1919, the county court confirmed the assessments made upon the lands annexed as well as the assessment upon the other lands in the district. Nearly all lands embraced in the annexation to the district, including the land of appellant, belonged to the United States at the time the original district was \n\n[278 U.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n organized in 1917 but prior to June 23, 1919, Rice and practically all the other homesteaders of the United States in this district received their final certificates of entry or their patents on the land herein involved. After that date, on April 5, 1922, the board of directors of the district filed a report in the county court stating that the assessment of benefits had become unequal and offered a complete reassessment of benefits upon all the lands in the district, including the annexed lands. And on May 31, 1922, the county court made an order establishing a readjustment of the assessment of benefits. Rice died, and the Exchange Trust Company succeeded him as his executor. This suit was brought to enjoin the enforcement of the assessments on his property in the drainage district, on the ground that the assessments were made while the land in question was the property of the United States, and before Rice's title had ripened into ownership.\n The plaintiff's contention was that the drainage assessments were void on the authority of Lee v. Osceola & Little River Road Improvement District No. 1 of Mississippi County, Arkansas, \n268 \nU.S. 643\n, 45 S. Ct. 620. In that case it was held that a state could not impose special taxes on lands acquired by private owners from the United States on account of benefits resulting from a road improvement made before the United States parted with its title. In this case the chancellor of the state court held that the Lee Case applied, and enjoined the enforcement of the assessments. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that Rice and his executor were estopped to object to the collection of the assessments. Drainage Dist. No. 7 of Poinsett County v. Exchange Trust Co., 175 Ark. 934, 2 S.W.(2d) 32.\n Objection was made to the defects in the proceedings of annexation, but they were cured by an act of the Legislature covering the reassessment, which was approved and confirmed March 23, 1923 (Special Acts Ark. 1923, p. 1638). It is quite clear that this \n\n[278 U.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n curative act was completely effective. Read v. City of Plattsmouth, \n107 \nU.S. 568\n, 2 S. Ct. 208; First National Bank v. County of Yankton, \n101 U.S. 129\n; Utter v. Franklin, \n172 \nU.S. 416\n, 19 S. Ct. 183; Town of Thompson v. Perrine, \n103 U.S. 806\n.\n But, however this may be, it is clear that Rice and his associates deliberately sought the benefit of the annexation of the lands to the east of the river, acquired it, and are now enjoying it, and that they cannot now be heard to question the validity of the assessments invited by them for the very purpose of securing the benefits conferred. This fully distinguishes the Lee Case.\n Nor is it even necessary to resort to the principles of estoppel in pais in this case. The record shows that the lands were annexed by the county court order of March 15, 1918; that the plans for improvement east of the St. Francis river were not filed until May 24, 1919; and that the first assessment filed affecting the lands in controversy was on May 24, 1919. Neither the plans nor the assessments were approved until June 23, 1919. The first bonds issued affecting the lands here involved were issued August 1, 1919. By June, 1919, Rice and practically all the other land owners who petitioned for the annexation had received final certificates of entry from the United States. By those certificates they acquired the equitable title to the land, and that became subject to taxation and assessment, even though the legal title remained in the United States. Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 42 S. Ct. 293; Bothwell v. Bingham County, \n237 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 35 S. Ct. 702; Witherspoon v. Duncan, 21 Ark. 240; Id., 4 Wall. 210. Moreover, the record shows that the final certificate was issued to Rice February 14, 1919, and that a patent was issued to him June 3, 1919. It follows that the work to be done for the benefit of these lands was not done until after the full legal title had passed to Rice.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n[278 U.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n There was another issue in this case when it first came here. This concerned assessments upon the St. Francis levee district, which Rice and his associates also sought to enjoin. At the argument, the parties agreed upon a consent order in respect to the levee district as follows:\n'This cause came on to be heard at this term, and was argued by counsel; and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, counsel for defendant in error, St. Francis levee district, consenting, it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed as follows, viz.:\n\n'That the prayer of the complaint for cancellation of decrees of foreclosure in favor of defendant in error, St. Francis levee district, is granted and said decrees are cancelled and held for naught as clouds upon the title to said lands; and said St. Francis levee district is forever enjoined from taxing or attempting to tax said lands to pay for improvements made or administrative or other expenses incurred prior to issuing of final certificate by the United States; that said lands are subject to tax for the cost of improvements, administrative, or other expenses of said St. Francis levee district contracted for subsequent to the issuing of final certificate from the United States and the Supreme Court of Arkansas is reversed in so far as the judgment is inconsistent herewith, and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Arkansas for further proceedings not inconsistent with this conclusion.\n\n'Mandate will issue accordingly.'\n\n The above opinion and the agreed order dispose of the whole case so far as this court is concerned. The Supreme Court of Arkansas will be at liberty to take such further action in the case as may be in keeping with the local law and not inconsistent with our opinion and agreed order. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. KLESNER(1929)\nNo. 923\nArgued: Decided: October 14, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Adrien F. Busick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Clarence R. Ahalt, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, for the second time. It was brought in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia by the Federal Trade Commission under section 5 of the Act of September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 719 (15 USCA  45), to enforce an order entered by it. The order directs Klesner, an interior decorator, who does business in Washington under the name of Hooper & Klesner, to 'cease and desist from using the words 'Shade Shop' standing alone or in conjunction with other words as an identification of the business conducted by him, in any manner of advertisement, signs, stationery, telephone, or business directories, trade lists or otherwise.' That court dismissed the suit on the ground that, unlike United States Circuit Courts of Appeals, it lacked jurisdiction to enforce orders of the Federal Trade Commission. 6 F. (2d) 701, 56 App. D. C. 3. On the first certiorari, we reversed the decree and directed that the cause be remanded for further proceedings. Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n274 \nU.S. 145\n, 47 S. Ct. 557. Then the case was reargued before the Court of Appeals, on the pleadings and a transcript of the record before the \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n Commission, and was dismissed on the merits, with costs. 25 F.(2d) 524, 58 App. D. C. 100, This second writ of certiorari was thereupon granted. \n278 \nU.S. 591\n, 49 S. Ct. 30. We are of opinion that the decree of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed-not on the merits, but upon the ground that the filing of the complaint before the Commission was not in the public interest.\n The conduct which the Commission held to be an unfair method of competition practiced within the District had been persisted in by Klesner ever since December, 1915. The complaint before the Commission was filed on December 18, 1920. The order sought to be enforced was entered June 23, 1922. This suit was begun on May 13, 1924. The evidence before the Commission, which occupies 394 pages of the printed record in this court, is conflicting only to a small extent. The findings of the Commission are in substance as follows:\n Sammons has for many years done business in Washington as maker and seller of window shades, under the name of 'The Shade Shop.' Prior to 1914, that name had, by long use, come to signify to the buying public of the District the business of Sammons. The concern known as Hooper & Klesner has also been in business in Washington for many years. Prior to 1915, its trade had consisted mainly of painting and of selling and hanging wallpaper. It had dealt also, to some extent, in window shades, taking orders which it had executed either by Sammons or some other maker of window shades. In 1914, Hooper & Klesner leased a new store pursuant to an arrangement with Sammons, and sublet to him a part of it. There Sammons continued his business of making and selling window shades as an independent concern under the name of 'The Shade Shop.' His gross sales there were at the rate of $60,000 a year. On a Sunday in November, 1915, he removed all his effects from those \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n premises and established his business in another building four doors away.\n Sammons' removal was in confessed violation of his agreement with Hooper & Klesner. An acrimonious controversy ensued. Threats of personal violence led to Sammons having Klesner arrested, and this to bitter animosity. Out of spite to Sammons, and with the purpose and intent of injuring him and getting his trade, Hooper & Klesner decided to conduct on its own account, in the premises which Sammons had vacated, the business of making and selling window shades. It placed upon its show windows, and also upon its letterheads and billheads, the words 'Shade Shop,' and listed its business in the local telephone directory as 'Shade Shop, Hooper & Klesner' and as 'Shade Shop.' A like sign was placed on its delivery trucks. This use by Hooper & Klesner of the term 'Shade Shop' has caused, and is causing, 'confusion to the window-shade purchasing public throughout the District,' and, on certain occasions, customers who entered Hooper & Klesner's shop were deceived by employees, being led to believe that it was Sammons.' Meanwhile, Klesner had become the sole owner of the business.\n Such were the findings of the Commission. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no showing either that Klesner was attempting to dispose of his goods under the pretense that they were the goods of Sammons, or that he was attempting to deceive or entice any of Sammons' customers; that the evidence introduced to show deception went no further than that some of the public may have purchased from Klesner under a mistaken belief that they were dealing with Sammons; that the words 'Shade Shop' were being used by Klesner always in connection with the words Hooper & Klesner; and that the term 'Shade Shop,' as used by Klesner, merely indicated \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n that his store was a place where window shades were made and sold. The Court of Appeals ruled that these words, being descriptive of a trade or business, were incapable of exclusive appropriation as a legal trade-mark or trade-name, and that there was nothing in the facts to justify the charge of unfair competition. It, therefore, dismissed the suit on the merits, the ground of decision being that there was a lack of those facts which, in a court of law or of equity, are essential to the granting of relief for alleged acts of unfair competition.\n We need not decide whether the Court of Appeals was justified in all of its assumptions of fact or in its conclusions on matters of law. For we are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed on a preliminary ground which made it unnecessary for that court to enquire into the merits. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act does not provide private persons with an administrative remedy for private wrongs. The formal complaint is brought in the Commission's name; the prosecution is wholly that of the government; and it bears the entire expense of the prosecution. A person who deems himself aggrieved by the use of an unfair method of competition is not given the right to institute before the Commission a complaint against the alleged wrongdoer. Nor may the Commission authorize him to do so. He may of course bring the matter to the Commission's attention and request it to file a complaint. \n1\n But a denial of his request is final. And if the request is granted and a proceeding is \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n instituted, he does not become a party to it or have any control over it. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The provisions in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 USCA  41-51) concerning unfair competition are often compared with those of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) dealing with unjust discrimination. But in their bearing upon private rights, they are wholly dissimilar. The latter act imposes upon the carrier many duties; and it creates in the individual corresponding rights. For the violation of the private right it affords a private administrative remedy. It empowers any interested person deeming himself aggrieved to file, as of right, a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission; and it requires the carrier to make answer. Moreover, the complainant there, as in civil judicial proceedings, bears the expense of prosecuting his claim. \n3\n The Federal Trade Commission Act contains no such features.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n While the Federal Trade Commission exercises under section 5 the functions of both prosecutor and judge, the scope of its authority is strictly limited. A complaint may be filed only 'if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public.' This requirement is not satisfied by proof that there has been misapprehension and confusion on the part of purchasers, or even that they have been deceived-the evidence commonly adduced by the plaintiff in 'passing off' cases in order to establish the alleged private wrong. It is true that in suits by private traders to enjoin unfair competition by 'passing off,' proof that the public is deceived is an essential element of the cause of action. This proof is necessary only because otherwise the plaintiff has not suffered an injury. There, protection of the public is an incident of the enforcement of a private right. \n4\n But to justify the Commission in filing a complaint under section 5, the purpose must be protection of the public. \n5\n The protection thereby afforded to private persons is the incident. Public interest may exist although the practice deemed unfair does not violate any private right. In Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441\n, 42 S. Ct. 150, 19 A. L. R. 882, a practice was suppressed as being against public policy, although no private right either of a trader or of a purchaser appears to have been invaded. In Federal Trade Commission v. Winsted \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n Hosiery Co., \n258 \nU.S. 483\n, 42 S. Ct. 384, an unfair practice was suppressed because it affected injuriously a substantial part of the purchasing public, although the method employed did not involve invasion of the private right of any trader competed against.\n In determining whether a proposed proceeding will be in the public interest the Commission exercises a broad discretion. But the mere fact that it is to the interest of the community that private rights shall be respected is not enough to support a finding of public interest. To justify filing a complaint the public interest must be specific and substantial. Often it is so, because the unfair method employed threatens the existence of present or potential competition. Sometimes, because the unfair method is being employed under circumstances which involve flagrant oppression of the weak by the strong. Sometimes, because, although the aggregate of the loss entailed may be so serious and widespread as to make the matter one of public consequence, no private suit would be brought to stop the unfair conduct, since the loss to each of the individuals affected is too small to warrant it. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The alleged unfair competition here complained of arose out of a controversy essentially private in its nature. The practice was persisted in largely out of hatred and malice engendered by Sammons' act. It is not claimed that the article supplied by Klesner was inferior to that \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n of Sammons, or that the public suffered otherwise financially by Klesner's use of the words 'Shade Shop.' It is significant that the complaint before the Commission was not filed until after the dismissal, in 1920, of a suit which had been brought by Sammons in 1915, in the Supreme Court of the District, to enjoin Klesner's use of the words 'Shade Shop.' \n7\n When the Commission directed the filing of the complaint Hooper & Klesner had been using those words in its business for five years. They had been used for nearly seven years before the order here in question was made; and for nearly nine years before this suit to enforce it was begun. Whatever confusion had originally resulted from Klesner's use of the words must have been largely dissipated before the Commission first took action. If members of the public were in 1920, or later, seriously interested in the matter, it must have been because they had become partisans in the private controversy between Sammons and Klesner.\n The order here sought to be enforced was entered upon a complaint which had in terms been authorized by a resolution of the Commission. The resolution declared, in an appropriate form, both that the Commission had reason to believe that Klesner was violating section 5 and that it appeared to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public. Thus, the resolution was sufficient to confer upon the Commission jurisdiction of the complaint. Section 5 makes the Commission's finding of facts conclusive, if supported by evidence. Its preliminary determination that \n\n[280 U.S. 19, 30]\n\u00a0\n institution of a proceeding will be in the public interest, while not strictly within the scope of that provision, will ordinarily be accepted by the courts. But the Commission's action in authorizing the filing of a complaint, like its action in making an order thereon, is subject to judicial review. The specific facts established may show, as a matter of law, that the proceeding which it authorized is not in the public interest, within the meaning of the act. If this appears at any time during the course of the proceeding before it, the Commission should dismiss the complaint. If, instead, the Commission enters an order, and later brings suit to enforce it, the court should, without enquiry into the merits, dismiss the suit.\n The undisputed facts, established before the Commission, at the hearings on the complaint, showed affirmatively the private character of the controversy. It then became clear (if it was not so earlier) that the proceeding was not one in the interest of the public; and that the resolution authorizing the complaint had been improvidently entered. Compare Gerard C. Henderson, The Federal Trade Commission, pp. 52-54, 174, 228, 229, 337. It is on this ground that the judgment dismissing the suit is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The rules of practice adopted by the Commission require that the application be in writing and 'contain a short and simple statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation of law and the name and address of the applicant and of the party complained of.'

PALADINI(1929)\nNo. 299\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. W. Hutton and R. T. Lynch, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ira S. Lillick, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner suffered a severe injury on the high seas while employed as an engineer on the tugboat Henrietta, \n\n[279 U.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n belonging to A. Paladini, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of California. He sued the corporation and also the respondents, the stockholders of the same, seeking to hold the latter liable under the Constitution of the State, article 12,  3, and the Civil Code,  322, which provide that each stockholder shall be individually and personally liable for such proportion of all its debts and liabilities contracted during the time he was a stockholder, as the amount of stock owned by him bears to the whole of the subscribed capital stock. The respondents took proceedings in the District Court of the United States to limit their liability under the Acts of Congress, and the limitation was established by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under R. S.  4283 ( Code, title 46,  183 (46 USCA  183)), and the Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  18, 23 Stat. 57 (Code, title 46,  189 (46 USCA  189)) 26 F.(2d) 21. These statutes, it will be remembered, provide for the limitation of the liability of shipowners to the value of the vessel and pending freight, and of part owners to their proportional share. The argument of the present petitioner is that the stockholders of A. Paladini, Inc., were not the owners of the Henrietta and that their liability under the law of California was an independent one voluntarily assumed by contract, with which the Acts of Congress do not interfere.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals disposed of the case after a thorough discussion. It is unnecessary to do more than to make a short statement of the points. The purpose of the act of Congress was 'to encourage investment by exempting the investor from loss in excess of the fund he is willing to risk in the enterprise.' (C. C. A.) 26 F.(2d) 24; Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 \nU.S. 96, 103\n, 32 S. Ct. 27; Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 47 S. Ct. 357. For this purpose no rational distinction can be taken between several persons owning shares in a vessel directly and making the same division by putting the title in a corporation and distributing the corporate stock. The \n\n[279 U.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n policy of the statutes must extend equally to both. In common speech the stockholders would be called owners, recognizing that their pecuniary interest did not differ substantially from those who held shares in the ship. We are of opinion that the words of the acts must be taken in a broad and popular sense in order not to defeat the manifest intent. This is not to ignore the distinction between a corporation and its members, a distinction that cannot be overlooked even in extreme cases, Behn, Meyer & Co. v. Miller, \n266 \nU.S. 457, 472\n, 45 S. Ct. 165, but to interpret an untechnical word in the liberal way in which we believe it to have been used-as has been done in other cases. International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19.\n The other branch of the petitioner's argument seems to us a perversion of the California law. The effect of that law so far as it goes is to destroy the operation of a charter as a nonconductor between the persons injured by a breach of corporate duty and the members of the corporation, who but for the charter would be liable. As suggested in Flash v. Conn, \n109 \nU.S. 371\n, 3 S. Ct. 263, it leaves the members to a certain extent in the position of copartners. But that is the liability that the Acts of Congress mean to limit. Having no doubt of the comprehensive purpose of Congress we should not be ingenious to construe the California statute in such a way as to raise questions whether it could be allowed to interfere with the uniformity which has been declared a dominant requirement for admiralty law.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFROST v.

Gen. of Oklahoma, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant owns a cotton ginning business in the city of Durant, Okl., which he operates under a permit from the State Corporation Commission. By a statute of Oklahoma, originally passed in 1915 and amended from time to time thereafter, cotton gins are declared to be public utilities, and their operation for the purpose of ginning seed cotton to be a public business. Comp. Stats. 1921,  3712. The commission is empowered to fix their charges and to regulate and control them in other respects. Section 3715. No gin can be operated without a license from the commission, and in order to secure such license there must be a satisfactory showing of public necessity. Section 3714, as amended by chapter 109, Session Laws 1925. The only substantial amendment to this section made by the act of 1925 is to add the proviso: 'Provided, that on the presentation of a petition for the establishment of a gin to be run co-operatively, signed by one hundred (100) citizens and tax payers of the community where the gin is to be located, the Corporation Commission shall issue a license for said gin.'\n By an act of the state Legislature, passed in 1917 (Comp. Stats. 1921 ,  5599), co-operative agricultural or \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n horticultural associations not having capital stock or being conducted for profit, may be formed for the purpose of mutual help by persons engaged in agriculture or horticulture. Under a statute passed in 1919 (Comp. Stats. 1921,  5637 et seq.) 10 or more persons may form a corporation for the purpose of conducting, among others, an agricultural or horticultural business upon a co-operative plan. A corporation thus formed is authorized to issue capital stock to be sold at not less than its par value. The number of shares which may be held by one person, firm or corporation is limited. Dividends may be declared by the directors at a rate not to exceed 8 per cent. per annum. Provision is made for setting aside a surplus or reserve fund, and 5 per cent. may be set aside for educational purposes. The remainder of the profits of the corporation must be apportioned and paid to its members ratably upon the amounts of the products sold to the corporation by its members and the amounts of the purchases of members from the corporation; but the corporation may adopt by-laws providing for the apportionment of such profits in part to nonmembers upon the amounts of their purchases and sales from or to the corporation.\n The Durant Co-operative Gin Company, one of the appellees, was organized in 1926 under the act of 1919. After its incorporation, the company made an application to the commission for a permit to establish a cotton gin at Durant, accompanying its application with a petition signed by 100 citizens and taxpayers, as required by the statutory proviso above quoted. Appellant protested in writing against the granting of such permit and there was a hearing. The commission, at the hearing, rejected an offer to show that there was no public necessity for the establishment of an additional gin at Durant, and held that the proviso made it mandatory to grant the permit applied for without regard to necessity. Thereupon ap- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 519]\n\u00a0\n pellant brought this suit to enjoin the commission from issuing the permit prayed for and to enjoin the Durant company from the establishment of a cotton gin at Durant, upon the ground that the proviso, as construed and applied by the commission (see Mont. Bank v. Yellowstone County, \n276 \nU.S. 499, 504\n, 48 S. Ct. 331), was invalid as contravening the due process and equal protection of the law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court below, consisting of three judges under section 266, Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), denied the prayer for an injunction and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. 26 F.(2d) 508.\n\n 1. \nWe first consider the preliminary contention made on behalf of appellees that appellant has no property right to be affected by operations of the Durant Company, and therefore no standing to invoke the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment or to appeal to a court of equity.\n It already appears that cotton gins are declared by the Oklahoma statute to be public utilities, and their operation for the purpose of ginning seed cotton to be public business. No one can operate a cotton gin for such purpose without securing a permit from the commission. In their regulation and control, the commission is given the same authority which it has in respect of transportation and transmission companies, and the same power to fix rates, charges and regulations. Comp. Stats. 1921,  3712, 3713, 3715. Under section 3714 as amended, supra (laying the proviso out of consideration for the moment), the commission may deny a permit for the operation of a gin where there is no public necessity for it, and may authorize a new ginning plant only after a showing is made that such plant is a needed utility. Both parties definitely concede the validity of these provisions, and, for present purposes at least, we accept that view.\n It follows that the right to operate a gin and to collect tolls therefor, as provided by the Oklahoma statute, is not \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 520]\n\u00a0\n a mere license, but a franchise, granted by the state in consideration of the performance of a public service, and as such it constitutes a property right within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co., \n172 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 19 S. Ct. 77; California v. Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1, 40\n, 41 S., 8 S. Ct. 1073; Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 328\n, 329 S., 13 S. Ct. 622; Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n230 U.S. 58\n, 64-66, 33 S. Ct. 988; Boise Water Co. v. Boise City, \n230 \nU.S. 84, 90\n, 91 S., 33 S. Ct. 997; McPhee & McGinnity Co. v. Union Pac. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 158 F. 5, 10, 11.\n In California v. Pacific Railroad Co., supra, 127 U. S. pages 40, 41 ( 8 S. Ct. 1080), a franchise is defined as 'a right, privilege or power of public concern, which ought not to be exercised by private individuals at their mere will and pleasure, but should be reserved for public control and administration, either by the government directly, or by public agents, acting under such conditions and regulations as the government may impose in the public interest, and for the public security. ... No private person can establish a public highway, or a public ferry, or railroad, or charge tolls for the use of the same, without authority from the Legislature, direct or derived. These are franchises. ... The list might be continued indefinitely.'\n Specifically, the foregoing authorities establish that the right to supply gas or water to a municipality and its inhabitants, the right to carry on the business of a telephone system, to operate a railroad, a street railway, city waterworks or gasworks, to build a bridge, operate a ferry, and to collect tolls therefor, are franchises. And these are but illustrations of a more comprehensive list, from which it is difficult, upon any conceivable ground, to exclude a cotton gin, declared by statute to be a public utility engaged in a public business, the operation of which is precluded without a permit from a state governmental agency, and which is subject to the same authority as that exercised over transportation and transmission companies in respect \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 521]\n\u00a0\n of rates, charges and regulations. Under these conditions, to engage in the business is not a matter of common right, but a privilege, the exercise of which, except in virtue of a public grant, would be in derogation of the state's power. Such a privilege, by every legitimate test, is a franchise.\n Appellant, having complied with all the provisions of the statute, acquired a right to operate a gin in the city of Durant by valid grant from the state acting through the corporation commission. While the right thus acquired does not preclude the state from making similar valid grants to others, it is, nevertheless, exclusive against any person attempting to operate a gin without obtaining a permit or, what amounts to the same thing, against one who attempts to do so under a void permit, in either of which events the owner may resort to a court of equity to restrain the illegal operation upon the ground that such operation is an injurious invasion of his property rights. 6 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, 3d Ed. ( 2 Equitable Remedies)  583, 584; People's Transit Co. v. Henshaw (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 87, 90; Bartlesville El. L. & P. Co. v. Bartlesville I. R. Co., 26 Okl. 453, 109 P. 228, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 77; Patterson v. Wollmann, 5 N. D. 608, 611, 67 N. W. 1040, 33 L. R. A. 536; Millville Gas L. Co. v. Vineland L. & P. Co., 72 N. J. Eq. 305, 307, 65 A. 504. The injury threatened by such an invasion is the impairment of the owner's business, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n If the proviso dispensing with a showing of public necessity on the part of the Durant and similar companies is invalid as claimed, the foregoing principles afford a sufficient basis for the maintenance of the present suit, against not only the Durant Company, but the members of the commission who threaten to issue a permit for the establishment of a new gin by that company without a showing of public necessity.\n\n 2. \nIs, then, the effect of the proviso to deny appellant the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment? As the proviso was construed \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 522]\n\u00a0\n and applied by the commission and by the court below, its effect is to relieve all corporations organized under the act of 1919 from an onerous restriction upon the right to engage in a public business which is imposed by the statute upon appellant and other individuals, as well as corporations organized under general law, engaging in such business. That a greater burden thereby is laid upon the latter than upon the former is clear. Immunity to one from a burden imposed upon another is a form of classification and necessarily results in inequality; but not necessarily that inequality forbidden by the Constitution. The inequality thus prohibited is only such as is actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary. Arkansas Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, \n261 \nU.S. 379, 384\n, 43 S. Ct. 387, and cases cited.\n The purpose of the clause in respect of equal protection of the laws is to rest the rights of all persons upon the same rule under similar circumstances. Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S. Ct. 423. This Court has several times decided that a corporation is as much entitled to the equal protection of the laws as an individual. Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389, 400\n, 48 S. Ct. 553; Kentucky Finance Corporation v. Paramount Exch., \n262 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 43 S. Ct. 636; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 154\n, 17 S. Ct. 255. The converse, of course, is equally true. A classification which is bad because it arbitrarily favors the individual as against the corporation certainly cannot be good when it favors the corporation as against the individual. In either case, the classification, in order to be valid, \" must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 U.S. 412\n, 415 (40 S. Ct. 560); Air-way Corp. v. Day, \n266 U.S. 71\n, 85 (45 S. Ct. 12); Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 U.S. 230\n, 240 (46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224). That is to say, mere difference is not enough; the attempted classification 'must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 523]\n\u00a0\n and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.' Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 155 (17 S. Ct. 255).' Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, supra, 277 U. S. page 37 ( 48 S. Ct. 425).\n By the terms of the statute here under consideration, appellant, an individual, is forbidden to engage in business unless he can first show a public necessity in the locality for it; while corporations organized under the act of 1919, however numerous, may engage in the same business in the same locality no matter how extensively the public necessity may be exceeded. That the immunity thus granted to the corporation is one which bears injuriously against the individual does not admit of doubt, since by multiplying plants without regard to necessity the effect well may be to deprive him of business which he would otherwise obtain if the substantive provision of the statute were enforced.\n It is important to bear in mind that the Durant Company was not organized under the act of 1917, but under that of 1919. The former authorizes the formation of an association for mutual help, without capital stock, not conducted for profit, and restricted to the business of its own members, except that it may act as agent to sell farm products and buy farm supplies for a nonmember, but as a condition may impose upon him a liability, not exceeding that of a member, for the contracts, debts and engagements of the assocition, such services to be performed at the actual cost thereof including a pro rata part of the overhead expenses. Comp. Stats. 1921,  5608. Under this exception, the difference between a nonmember and a member is not of such significance or the authority conferred of such scope as to have any material effect upon the general purposes or character of the corporation as a mutual association. As applied to corporations organized under the 1917 act, we have no reason to doubt that the \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 524]\n\u00a0\n classification created by the proviso might properly be upheld. American Sugar Refinding Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S. Ct. 43; Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers, \n273 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S. Ct. 291. A corporation organized under the act of 1919, however, has capital stock, which, up to a certain amount, may be subscribed for by any person, firm or corporation; is allowed to do business for others; to make profits and declare dividends, not exceeding eight per cent. per annum; and to apportion the remainder of its earnings among it members ratably upon the amount of products sold by them to the corporation. Such a corporation is in no sense a mutual association. Like its individual competitor, it does business with the general public for the sole purpose of making money. Its members need not even be cotton growers. They may be- all or any of them-bankers of merchants or capitalists having no interest in the business differing in any respect from that of the members of an ordinary corporation. The differences relied upon to justify the classification are, for that purpose, without substance. The provision for paying a portion of the profits to members or, if so determined, to nonmembers, based upon the amounts of their sales to or purchases from the corporation, is a device which, without special statutory authority, may be and often is resorted to by ordinary corporations for the purpose of securing business. As a basis for the classification attempted, it lacks both relevancy and substance. Stripped of immaterial distinctions and reduced to its ultimate effect, the proviso, as here construed and applied, baldly creates one rule for a natural person and a different and contrary rule for an artificial person, notwithstanding the fact that both are doing the same business with the general public and to the same end, namely, that of reaping profits. That is to say, it produces a classification which subjects one to the burden of showing a public necessity for his business, from which it relieves the other, and is essentially arbi- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 525]\n\u00a0\n trary, because based upon no real or substantial differences, having reasonable relation to the subject dealt with by the legislation. Power Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 47 S. Ct. 678; Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, supra, \n277 \nU.S. 39\n, 48 S. Ct. 423; Quaker City Cab. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n277 \nU.S. 402\n, 48 S. Ct. 553.\n\n 3. \nThe further question must be answered: Are the proviso and the substantive provisions which it qualifies separable, so that the latter may stand although the former has fallen? If the answer be in the negative- that is to say, if the parts of the statute be held to be inseparable-the decree below should be affirmed, since, in that event, although the proviso be bad, the inequality created by it would disappear with the fall of the entire statute and no basis for equitable relief would remain. But for reasons now to be stated we are of opinion that the substantive provisions of the statute are severable and may stand independently of the proviso.\n If section 3714 as originally passed had contained the proviso, the effect would be to render the entire section invalid, because then the result of upholding the substantive part of the section notwithstanding the invalidity of the proviso would have been to make applicable to the Durant Company and others similarly organized, the requirement in respect of a showing of public necessity, although the legislative will contemporaneously expressed as part of the same act was to the contrary. In this state of the matter, to hold otherwise would be to extend the scope of the law in that regard so as to embrace corporations which the Legislature passing the statute had, by its very terms, expressly excluded, and thus to go in the face of the rule that where the excepting proviso is found unconstitutional the substantive provisions which it qualifies cannot stand. Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478, 484\n, 42 S. Ct. 164.' 'For all the purposes of construction (the proviso) is to be regarded as part of the act. The meaning of the legislature must be gathered from all they have said, as well from that which \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 526]\n\u00a0\n is ineffective for want of power, as from that which is authorized by law.' State ex rel. McNeal v. Dombaugh, 20 Ohio St. 167, 174, 175.\n But the proviso here in question was not in the original section. It was added by way of amendment many years after the original section was enacted. If valid, its practical effect would be to repeal by implication the requirement of the existing statute in respect of public necessity in so far as the Durant and similar corporations are concerned. But since the amendment is void for unconstitutionality, it cannot be given that effect, 'because an existing statute cannot be recalled or restricted by anything short of a constitutional enactment.' Davis v. Wallace, supra, 257 U. S. page 485, 42 S. Ct. 166.\n To this effect also is Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 U.S. 312\n, 341-342, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375. In that case there had been in force in Arizona, both as a state and a territory, for many years, a general statute granting authority to judges of the courts of first instance to issue writs of injunction. The statute was amended so as to except from its operation certain cases between employers and employees. The amendment was declared invalid as denying the equal protection of the laws; but the general provision of the statute as it originally stood was upheld upon the ground that it had been in force for many years and that an exception in the form of an unconstitutional amendment could not be given the effect of repealing it. And see Waters-Pierce Oil Company v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 28, 47\n, 20 S. Ct. 518.\n Here it is conceded that the statute, before the amendment, was entirely valid. When passed, it expressed the will of the Legislature which enacted it. Without an express repeal, a different Legislature undertook to create an exception, but, since that body sought to express its will by an amendment which, being unconstitutional, is a nullity and, therefore, powerless to work any change in \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 527]\n\u00a0\n the existing statute, that statute must stand as the only valid expression of the legislative intent.\n In passing upon a similar situation, the Supreme Court of Michigan, speaking through Judge Cooley, in Campau v. Detroit, 14 Mich. 276, 286, said: 'But nothing can come in conflict with a nullity, and nothing is therefore repealed by this act on the ground solely of its being inconsistent with a section of this law which is entirely unconstitutional and void.' In Carr, Auditor, v. State ex rel. Coetlosquet, 127 Ind. 204, 215, 26 N. E. 778, 781 (11 L. R. A. 370, 22 Am. St. Rep. 624), the state Supreme Court disposed of the same point in these words: 'We suppose it clear that no law can be changed or repealed by a subsequent act which is void because unconstitutional. ... An act which violates the Constitution has no power and can, of course, neither build up nor tear down. It can neither create new rights nor destroy existing ones. It is an empty legislative declaration without force or vitality.' See, also, People v. Butler Street Foundry, 201 Ill. 236, 257-259, 66 N. E. 349; People v. Fox, 294 Ill. 263, 269, 128 N. E. 505; McAllister v. Hamlin, 83 Cal. 361, 365, 23 P. 357; State ex rel. v. Mills, 231 Mo. 493, 498-499, 133 S. W. 22; Ex parte Davis (C. C.) 21 F. 396, 397. The question is not affected by the fact that the amendment was accomplished by inserting the proviso in the body of the original section and re-enacting the whole at length. Truax v. Corrigan, supra; People v. Butler Street Foundry, supra, 201 Ill. pages 258, 259, 66 N. E. 349; State ex rel. v. Mills, supra, 231 Mo. page 499, 133 S. W. 22.\n\n 4. \nIt is true that appellant applied for and obtained a permit to do business under the statute to which it was sought to attach the proviso in question. Is he, thereby, precluded from assailing the proviso upon the ground that one who claims the benefit of a statute may not assert its invalidity? It is not open to question that one who has acquired rights of property necessarily based upon a statute may not attack that statute as unconstitutional, for he cannot both assail it and rely upon it in the same proceeding. Hurley \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 528]\n\u00a0\n v. Commission of Fisheries, \n257 \nU.S. 223, 225\n, 42 S. Ct. 83. But here the proviso under attack, having been adopted by a subsequent act and being invalid, had no effect, as we have already said, upon the provisions of the statute. As applied to this case, it began and ended as a futile attempt by the Legislature to bring about a change in the law which a previous Legislature had enacted. For this purpose, and as construed and applied below, it was a nullity, wholly 'without force or vitality,' leaving the provisions of the existing statute unchanged. It necessarily results that appellant's rights came into being and owed their continued existence wholly to that statute, disconnected from the ineffective proviso, and it is that statute, so disconnected, which measures the extent to which he may enjoy and defend such rights. In seeking and obtaining the benefits of the statute, appellant proceeded without regard to the proviso, neither affirming nor denying nor in contemplation of law acquiescing in its validity; and his action cannot be made a basis upon which to rest a successful claim of an estoppel in pais or of a waiver of the right to maintain the constitutional challenge here made.\n We conclude: That the proviso is unconstitutional as contravening the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; that the remainder of the statute is separable and affords the sole rule in respect of the questions here to be determined; that the Corporation Commission is without power to issue permits to corporations organized under the act of 1919 without a showing of public necessity; that the Durant Company is without authority to do business in the absence of a permit thus issued; and that appellant is entitled to the relief for which he prays.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting). section 3714 of Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921, as amended by chapter 109 of the Laws of 1925, Frost secured \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 529]\n\u00a0\n from the Corporation Commission a license to operate a cotton gin in the city of Durant. 1 Later, the Durant Co-operative Gin Company applied to the commission under that statute for a license to operate a gin in the same city. In support of its application, it presented a certificate of organization under chapter 147 of the Laws of 1919 entitled 'An act providing for the organization and regulation of co-operative corporations' (Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921,  5637-5652), and a petition signed by one hundred citizens and taxpayers of that community requesting that the license be issued. Frost objected to the granting of a license, on the ground that there was no necessity for an additional gin in that city. The commission ruled that, upon the showing made, it was obliged by section 3714 as so amended to issue a license, without hearing evidence as to necessity; and indicated its purpose to issue the license. Thereupon, Frost brought this suit under  266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) against the commission, the Attorney General, and the Durant Company to enjoin granting the license. A restraining order issued upon the filing of the bill.\n The case was first heard by three judges upon application for an interlocutory injunction and upon defendants' motion to dismiss. Frost contended that his license had conferred a franchise; that from it there arose in him the property right to be protected against further local competition, unless existing ginning facilities were inadequate; that in the absence of a showing of necessity com- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 530]\n\u00a0\n petition by the Durant Company would be illegal; and that to issue a license which authorized such competition would take Frost's property without due process of law and deny to him the equal protection of the law. The District Court denied both the injunction and the motion to dismiss; and it dissolved the restraining order. Upon direct appeal by Frost, this court affirmed the interlocutory decree per curiam in Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 719\n, 47 S. Ct. 589, on the authority of Chicago Great Western Ry. Co. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 45 S. Ct. 55. Thereupon, the facts being stipulated, the case was submitted in the District Court on final hearing to the same judges; and a decree was entered dismissing the bill. 26 F.(2d) 508. This appeal presents the same questions which were argued on the appeal from the interlocutory decree.\n Under the Oklahoma act of 1907 cotton gins were held subject to regulation by the Corporation Commission. \n2\n In 1915, the Legislature declared them public utilities and restriction of competition was introduced by prohibiting operation of a gin without a license from the commission. That statute required that a license issue for proper gins already established, but directed that none should issue for a new gin in any community already adequately supplied, except upon 'the presentation of a petition signed by not less than fifty farmer petitioners of the immediate vicinity.' Session Laws 1915, c. 176 (Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921,  3712-3718). Chapter 191 of the Session Laws of 1923 struck out of section 3714 the provision referring to farmers. But in 1925 there was inserted in lieu thereof the proviso, 'that on the presentation of a petition for the establishment of a gin to be run co-operatively, signed by one hundred (100) \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 531]\n\u00a0\n citizens and taxpayers of the community where the gin is to be located, the Corporation Commission shall issue a license for said gin.' Session Laws 1925, c. 109. In 1926, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held in Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Commission, 121 Okl. 51, 52, 247 P. 390, that a corporation organized under chapter 147 of the Laws of 1919 was run co-operatively within the meaning of section 3714 as so amended.\n The attack upon the statute is rested mainly upon the contention that by requiring issuance of a license to so-called co-operative corporations organized under the law of 1919, the statute as amended in 1925 creates an arbitrary classification. The classification is said to be arbitrary, because the differences between such concerns and commercial corporations or individuals engaged in the same business are in this connection not material. The contention rests, I think, upon misapprehensions of fact. The differences are vital; and the classification is a reasonable one. Before stating why I think so, other grounds for affirming the judgment should be mentioned.\n First. The bill alleges, and the parties have stipulated, that Frost was licensed under section 3714 of the Compiled Statutes as amended by the act of 1925. The stipulation does not show that prior to the amendment he held any license. His alleged property right to conditional immunity from competition rests wholly on the statute now challenged. It is settled that one cannot in the same proceeding both rely upon a statute and assail it. Hurley v. Commission of Fisheries, \n257 \nU.S. 223, 225\n, 42 S. Ct. 83. Compare Great Falls Mfg. Co. v. Atty. General, \n124 \nU.S. 581, 598\n, 599 S., 8 S. Ct. 631; Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 412 S., 37 S. Ct. 609; St. Louis Malleable Casting Co. v. Prendergast Co., \n260 \nU.S. 469, 472\n, 473 S., 43 S. Ct. 178; Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307, 316\n, 45 S. Ct. 324, 38 A. L. R. 286; Booth Fisheries Co. v. Industrial Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 208, 211\n, 46 S. Ct. 491; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission (No. 1, October Term, 1928, decided January 2, 1929) \n278 \nU.S. 300\n, 49 S. Ct. 150, 73 L. Ed. -. This established rule requires affirmance of the judgment below. \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 532]\n\u00a0\n Second. Frost claims that to grant a license to the Durant Company without a showing of public necessity would involve taking his property without due process. The only property which he asserts would be so taken is the alleged right to be immune from the competition of persons operating without a valid license. But for the statute, he would obviously be subject to competition from any one. Whether the license issued to him under section 3714 conferred upon him the property right claimed is a question of statutory construction, and thus, ordinarily, a question of state law. 'Whether state statutes shall be construed one way or another is a state question, the final decision of which rests with the courts of the state.' Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S. C. St. 103, 104 ( 71 L. Ed. 270, 48 A. L. R. 1102). In the absence of a decision of the question by the highest court of the state, this court would be obliged to construe the statute; and in doing so it might be aided by consideration of the decisions of courts of other states dealing with like statutes. But the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has decided the precise question in Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Commission, 121 Okl. 51, 52, 247 P. 390, 391. It held that a license under section 3714 does not confer the property right claimed, saying: 'What property rights are taken from petitioners by licensing another gin, under the foregoing proviso? What rights of any kind could the licensing of another gin affect? It does not disturb the property of petitioners, nor prevent the free operation of their gins. The only right which could be affected by such license is the right of petitioners to operate their gin without competition, a right which is not secured to them either by the state or federal Constitution, hence the contention as to taking their property without due process of law cannot be sustained.' As no property right of Frost is invaded-his suit must fail, however objectionable the statute may be.\n Third. Frost claims that to issue a license to the Durant Company without a showing of necessity would \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 533]\n\u00a0\n violate the quality clause. Whether the license was issued to Frost upon a showing of necessity does not appear. The mere granting of a license to the Durant Company later on different, and perhaps easier, terms would not violate Frost's constitutional right to equality, since he has already secured his license under the statute as written. The fact that some one else similarly situated may hereafter be refused a license, and would be thereby discriminated against, is obviously not of legal significance here. Southern Railway Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524\n, 30 S. Ct. 594; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540\n, 32 S. Ct. 784; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571\n, 35 S. Ct. 167; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 149\n, 39 S. Ct. 237; Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers, \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S. Ct. 291.\n Fourth. Frost claims on another ground that his constitutional rights have been violated. He says that what the statute and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma call a license is in law a franchise; that a franchise is a contract; that where a constitutional question is raised this court must determine for itself what the terms of a contract are; and that this franchise should be construed as conferring the right to the conditional immunity from competition which he claims. None of the cases cited lend support to the contention that the license here issued is a franchise. \n3\n They hold merely that subordinate political \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 534]\n\u00a0\n bodies, as well as a Legislature, may grant franchises; and that violations of franchise rights are remediable, whoever the transgressor. Moreover, the limited immunity from competition claimed as an incident of the license was obviously terminable at any moment. Compare Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 409\n, 37 S. Ct. 158. It was within the power of the Legislature, at any time after the granting of Frost's license, to abrogate the requirement of a certificate of necessity, thus opening the business to the competition of all comers. It is difficult to see how the lesser enlargement of the possibilities of competition by a license granted under the 1925 proviso could operate as a denial of constitutional rights.\n It must also be borne in mind that a franchise to operate a public utility is not like the general right to engage in a lawful business, part of the liberty of the citizen; that it is a special privilege which does not belong to citizens generally; that the state may, in the exercise of its police power, make that a franchise or special privilege which at common law was a business open to all;4 that a special privilege is conferred by the state upon selected persons; that it is of the essence of a special privilege that the franchise may be granted or withheld at the pleasure of the state; that it may be granted to corporations only, thus excluding all individuals,5 and that the Federal Constitution imposes no limits upon the State's discretion in this respect. \n6\n In New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., \n115 \nU.S. 650\n, 6 S. Ct. 252, the plaintiff, \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 535]\n\u00a0\n claiming an exclusive franchise, sought to enjoin the competition of the defendant. The court said, at page 659 of 115 U. S. (6 S. Ct. 257): 'The right to operate gasworks, and to illuminate a city, is not an ancient or usual occupation of citizens generally. No one has the right to ... carry on the business of lighting the streets ... without special authority from the sovereign. It is a franchise belonging to the State, and, in the exercise of the police power, the state could carry on the business itself or select one or several agents to do so.\" The demurrer to the bill was dismissed. In New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Rivers, \n115 \nU.S. 674\n, 6 S. Ct. 273, on similar facts in deciding for the plaintiff, the court said at page 682 of 115 U. S. (6 S. Ct. 277), 'The restriction, imposed by the contract upon the use by others than plaintiff of the public streets and ways, for such purposes, is not one of which the appellee can complain. He was not thereby restrained of any freedom or liberty he had before. ...' One who would strike down a statute must show not only that he is affected by it, but that as applied to him, the statute exceeds the power of the state. This rule, acted upon as early as Austin v. The Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, and definitely stated in Supervisers v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n, 314, has been consistently followed since that time.\n Fifth. Frost's claim that the act of 1925 discriminates unjustifiably is not sound. The claim rests wholly on the fact that individuals and ordinary corporations must show inadequacy of existing facilities, while co-operatives organized under the act of 1919 may secure a license without making such a showing, if the application is supported by a petition of one hundred persons who are citizens and taxpayers in the community. It is settled that to provide specifically for peculiar needs of farmers or producers is a reasonable basis of classification. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S. Ct. 43; Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers', \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S. Ct. 291. And it is conceded that the classification made by the act of \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 536]\n\u00a0\n 1925 would be reasonable if it had been limited to co-operatives organized under chapter 22 of the Laws of 1917. Thus the contention that the classification is arbitrary is directed only to co-operatives organized under the law of 1919. It rests upon two erroneous assumptions: (1) That co-operatives organized under the law of 1919 are substantially unlike those organized under chapter 22 of the Laws of 1917; and (2) that there are between co-operative corporations under the law of 1919 and commercial corporations no substantial differences having reasonable relation to the subject dealt with by the gin ligislation.\n The assertion is that co-operatives organized under the law of 1919, being stock companies, do business with the general public for the sole purpose of making money, as do individual or other corporate competitors; whereas co-operatives organized under the law of 1917 are 'for mutual help, without capital stock, not conducted for profit, and restricted to the business of their own members.' The fact is that these tow types of co- operative corporations-the stock and the nonstock-differ from one another only in a few details, which are without significance in this connection; that both are instrumentalities commonly employed to promote and effect co- operation among farmers; that the two serve the same purpose; and that both differ vitally from commercial corporations. The farmers seek through both to secure a more efficient system of production and distribution and a more equitable allocation of benefits. But this is not their only purpose. Besides promoting the financial advantage of the participating farmers, they seek through co-operation to socialize their interests-to require an equitable assumption of responsibilities while assuring an equitable distribution of benefits. Their aim is economic democracy on lines of liberty, equality and fraternity. To accomplish these objectives, both types of co-operative corporations provide for excluding capitalist control. As means to this \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 537]\n\u00a0\n end, both provide for restriction of voting privileges, for curtailment of return on capital and for distribution of gains or savings through patronage dividends or equivalent devices.\n In order to insure economic democracy, the Oklahoma act of 1919 prevents any person from becoming a shareholder without the consent of the board of directors. It limits the amount of stock which one person may hold to $500. And it limits the voting power of a shareholder to one vote. Thus, in the Durant Company, the holder of a single share of the par value of $10 has as much voting power as the holder of 50 shares. The act further discourages entrance of mere capitalists into the co-operative by provisions which permit 5 per cent. of the profits to be set aside for educational purposes; which require 10 per cent. of the profits to be set aside as a reserve fund, until such fund shall equal at least 50 per cent. of the capital stock; which limit the annual dividends on stock to 8 per cent.; and which require that the rest of the year's profits be distributed as patronage dividends to members, except so far as the directors may apportion them to nonmembers.\n The provisions for the exclusion of capitalist control of the nonstock type of co-operative organized under the Oklahoma act of 1917 do not differ materially in character from those in the 1919 act. The nonstock co-operative also may reject applicants for membership; and no member may have more than one vote. This type of co-operative is called a nonprofit organization; but the term is merely one of art, indicating the manner in which the financial advantage is distributed. This type also is organized and conducted for the financial benefit of its members and requires capital with which to conduct its business. In the stock type the capital is obtained by the issue of capital stock, and members are not subjected to personal liability for the corporation's business obliga- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 538]\n\u00a0\n tions. In the nonstock type the capital is obtained parly from membership fees, partly through dues or assessments and partly through loans from members or others. And for fixed capital it substitutes in part personal liability of members for the corporation's obligations. \n7\n In the stock type there are eo nomine dividends on capital and patronage dividends. In the nonstock type the financial benefit is distributed by way of interest on loans and refunds of fees, dues and assessments. And all funds acquired through the co-operative's operations, which are in excess of the amount desirable for a 'working fund', are to be distributed as refunds of fees, dues, and assessments. Both acts allow business to be done for nonmembers; and though the nonstock association may, it is not required, to impose obligations on the nonmember for the liability of the association. Thus, for the purposes here relevant, there is no essential difference between the two types of co-operatives.\n The Oklahoma law of 1919 follows closely in its provisions the legislation enacted earlier in other states with a view to furthering farmers' co-operation. The first emergence of any settled policy as to the means to be employed for effecting co-operation among farmers in the United States came in 1875 when, at the annual convention of the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry, recommendations were formally adopted indorsing 'Rochdale principles,' and a form of rules for the guidance of prospective organizers was promulgated. These provided for stock companies with shares of $5 each; that no member be allowed to hold more than 100 shares; that ownership \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 539]\n\u00a0\n of a single share shall constitute the holder a member of the association; that only 8 per cent. 'interest' shall be paid on the capital; that the balance of the profits shall go 'either to increase the capital or business of the association, or for any educational or provident purposes authorized by the association,' or be distributed as patronage dividends; and that the patronage dividends be distributed among customers, except that nonmembers should receive only one-half the proportion of members. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The need of laws framed specifically for incorporating farmers' co- operatives being recognized, Massachusetts enacted in 1866 the necessary legislation by a general law which differed materially from that under which commercial organizations were formed. The statute provided for co- operatives having capital stock. \n9\n Before 1900, 10 other states had enacted laws of like character. \n10\n After \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 540]\n\u00a0\n 1900 many such statutes were passed. Now, only 2 states lack laws making specific provision for the incorporation of farmers' co-operatives. \n11\n Thirty-three states, at least, have enacted laws providing for the formation of co-operative associations of the stock type. All of them permit a fixed dividend on capital stock, the doing of business for nonmembers, and the distribution of patronage dividends. \n12\n Some of them, recognizing the need for elasticity, impose the single requirement that earnings be apportioned in part on a patronage basis, and leave all other provisions for organization and distribution of profits to the by-laws. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Farmers' co-operative incorporation laws of the nonstock type are of much more recent origin, and are fewer \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 541]\n\u00a0\n in number. \n14\n The earliest law of this character was the crude measure enacted in California in 1895.15 Statutes of that type have been passed in about 16 States;16 but 10 of these have also laws of the stock type. \n17\n The enactment of state laws for the incorporation of nonstock co-operatives and their extensive use in the co-operative marketing of commodities, are due largely to the fact that, prior to 1922, the Clayton Act, October 15, 1914, c. 232,  6 (38 Stat. 731; 15 USCA  17), limited to nonstock co- operatives the right to make a class of agreements with members which prior thereto would have been void as in restraint of \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 542]\n\u00a0\n trade. 18 See Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Tobacco Growers, \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S. Ct. 291. Nearly one-half of the existing laws of the nonstock type were enacted between 1914 and 1922.19 This limitation in the Clayton Act proved to be unwise. By the Capper-Volstead Act of February 18, 1922, c. 57,  1 (42 Stat. 388; 7 USCA  291), Congress recognizing the substantial indentity of the two classes of co-operatives, extended the same right to stock co-operatives. The terms of this legislation are significant:\n'That persons engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce, such products of persons so engaged. Such associations may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members may make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes: Provided, however, that such associations are operated for the mutual benefit of the members thereof, as such producers, and conform to one or both of the following requirements:\n\n'First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership capital he may own therein, or,\n\n'Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum. \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 543]\n\u00a0\n 'And in any case to the following:\n\n'Third. That the association shall not deal in the products of nonmembers to an amount greater in value than such as are handled by it for members.'\n\n Congress recognized the identity of the two classes of co-operatives, and the distinction between agricultural stock co-operative corporations and ordinary business corporations, also, by providing in the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, pt. III,  231 (44 Stat. 39; 26 USCA  982), that exemption from the income tax was not to be denied 'any such (co-operative) association because it has capital stock, if the dividend rate of such stock is fixed at not to exceed the legal rate of interest in the state of incorporation or 8 per centum per annum, whichever is greater, ... and if substantially all such stock ... is owned by producers; ... nor shall exemption be denied any such association because there is accumulated and maintained by it a reserve. ... Such an association may market the products of nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the products marketed for members.' This exemption was continued in the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852,  103 (45 Stat. 812; 26 USCA  2103).\n More than two-thirds of all farmers' co-operatives in the United States are organized under the stock type laws. In 1925 there were 10,147 reporting organizations. Of these 68.7 per cent. were stock associations. In leading states the percentage was larger. In Wisconsin the percentage was 80; in North Dakota 87; in Nebraska, 91.3; and in Kansas, 92. Of the farmers' co-operatives existing in Oklahoma in 1925, 87.6 per cent. were stock associations. \n20\n The great co-operative systems of Eng- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 544]\n\u00a0\n land, Scotland and Canada were developed and are now operated by organizations of the stock type. \n21\n The nonstock type of co-operative is not adapted to enterprises, which like gins require large investment in plant, and hence considerable fixed capital. \n22\n For this reason it was a common practice for marketing co-operatives, which had been organized as nonstock co-operatives in order to comply with the requirements of the Clayton Act above described, to form a subsidiary co-operative corporation with capital stock to carry on the incidental business of warehousing or processing which requires a large investment in plant. \n23\n And the fact that even the marketing of some products may be better served by the stock type of co-operative organizations is so widely recognized that most of the marketing acts provide that associations formed thereunder may organize either with or without capital stock. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n[278 U.S. 515, 545]\n\u00a0\n Experience has demonstrated, also, that doing business for nonmembers is usually deemed essential to the success of a co-operative. \n25\n More than five-sixths of all the farmers' co-operative associations in the United States do business for nonmembers. In 1925, 86.3 per cent. of the reporting organizations did so. In leading states the percentage was even larger. In Wisconsin the percentage was 89; in Missouri 93.2; in Minnesota 94.1; in Nebraska 95.8; in Kansas 96.5; in North Dakota 97. In Oklahoma 92 per cent. of all co-operatives did business for nonmembers. \n26\n Of the cotton co-operatives in the United States 93.9 per cent. did business for nonmembers. In Texas, where co-operative ginning has received successful trial,27 all the cotton co-operatives perform service for non- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 546]\n\u00a0\n members. In Oklahoma, also, all of the cotton co-operatives reporting do business for nonmembers. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n That no one plan of organization is to be labeled as truly co- operative to the exclusion of others was recognized by Congress in connection with co-operative banks and building and loan associations. See United States v. Cambridge Loan & Building Company, \n278 \nU.S. 55\n, 49 S. Ct. 39, 73 L. Ed. -. With the expansion of agricultural co-operation it has been recognized repeatedly. Congress gave its sanction to the stock type of co-operative by the Capper-Volstead Act and also by specifically exempting stock as well as nonstock co-operatives from income taxes. State Legislatures recognized the fundamental similarity of the two types of co- operation by unifying their laws so as to have a single statute under which either type of co-operative might organize. 29 And experts in the Department of Agriculture, charged with disseminating information to farmers and Legislatures, have warned against any crystallization of the co-operative plan, so as to exclude any type of co-operation. \n30\n\u00a0\n\n[278 U.S. 515, 547]\n\u00a0\n That in Oklahoma a law authorizing incorporation on the stock plan was essential to the development of co-operation among farmers has been demonstrated by the history of the movement in that state. Prior to 1917 there was no statute which specifically authorized the incorporation of co- operatives. In that year the nonstock law above referred to was enacted. \n31\n Two years passed, and only 3 co-operatives availed themselves of the provisions of that act. Then persons familiar with the farmers' problems in Oklahoma secured the passage of the law of 1919, providing for the incorporation of co-operatives with capital stock. \n32\n Within the next 5 years \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 548]\n\u00a0\n 202 co-operatives were formed under it; and since then 139 more. In the 12 years since 1917 only 60 nonstock co-operatives have been organized; most of them since 1923, when through an amendatory statute, this type was made to offer special advantages for co-operative marketing. \n33\n Thus over 82 per cent. of all co-operatives in Oklahoma are organized under the 1919 stock act. One husband and one Oklahoma co-operative cotton gins have been organized under the 1919 stock law; not a single one under the 1917 nonstock law. \n34\n To deny the co-operative character of the 1919 act is to deny the co-operative character, not only of the gins in Oklahoma, which farmers have organized and operated for their mutual benefit, but also that of most other co-operatives within the state, which have been organized under its statutes in harmony with legislation of Congress and pursuant to instructions from the United States Department of Agriculture. A denial of co-operative character to the stock co-operatives is inconsistent also with the history of the movement in other states and countries. For the stock type of co-operative is not only the older form, but is the type more widely used among English-speaking peoples.\n There remain to be considered other circumstances leading to the passage of the statute here challenged. As was said in Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, 340 (55 L. Ed. 369, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160): 'When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time law was enacted must be assumed.' Here that presumption is reinforced by facts which have been called to our attention. That evils exist in cotton ginning which are subject to drastic legislative regulation \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 549]\n\u00a0\n has recently been recognized by this court. Crescent Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n257 \nU.S. 129\n, 42 S. Ct. 42. The specific evils existing in Oklahoma which the statute here assailed was enacted to correct was the charging of extortionate prices to the farmer for inferior ginning service and the control secured of the cotton seed. \n35\n These conditions are partly attributable to the fact that a large percentage of the ordinary commercial gins in Oklahoma are controlled by cotton seed oil mills, which make their service as ginners incidental to that as crushers of seed, and are thereby enabled to secure the seed at less than its value. 36 That \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 550]\n\u00a0\n such control of gins may lead to excessive prices for the ginning service was recognized in the Crescent Oil Case. The fact that, despite the regulatory provisions of the Public Service Law, a public utility is permitted to earn huge profits indicates that something more than rate regulation may be needed for the protection of farmers. Certainly, it cannot be said that the Legislature could not reasonably believe that co- operative ginning might afford a corrective for rates believed to be extortionate.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion.\n\n Dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I agree with what Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has said. But there is one aspect of the decision now rendered to which I would especially direct attention. To me it would seem that there are such differences in organization, management, financial structure and practical operation between the business conducted by appellant, a single individual, and that conducted by a corporation organ- \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 551]\n\u00a0\n ized as is appellee, as to justify the classification and discrimination made by the statute. But, assuming there were no such differences, I fail to perceive any constitutional ground on which appellant can complain of a discrimination from which he has not suffered. His real and only complaint is not that he has been discriminated against either in the grant or enjoyment of his license, but that in the exercise of his nonexclusive privilege of carrying on the cotton ginning business he will suffer from competition by the corporate appellee which, under local law, may secure a like privilege with possibly less difficulty than did appellant.\n The proviso of the 1925 act is held unconstitutional solely on the ground that 'an onerous restriction upon the right to engage in a public business' was 'imposed by the statute upon appellant' and others similarly situated, which was not imposed on appellee. Appellant, if he had been denied a license, or if his exercise of the privilege, when granted, were more limited by the statute than that of appellee, might invoke the equal protection clause. But he now requires no such protection for he has received his license and is in full and unrestricted enjoyment of the same privilege as that which the appellee seeks. This is not less the case even if the statute be assumed to have made it more difficult for him than for appellee to secure a license.\n Whether the grant appellant has received be called a franchise or a license would seem to be unimportant, for in any case it is not an exclusive privilege. Under the Constitution and laws of Oklahoma the Legislature has power to amend or repeal the franchise, Constitution of Oklahoma, art. 9,  47; Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Comm., 121 Okl. 51, 247 P. 390; and injury suffered through an indefinite increase in the number of appellant's competitors by nondiscriminatory legislation, would clearly be damnum absque injuria. A similar in \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 552]\n\u00a0\n crease under the present alleged discriminatory statute would seem likewise to afford appellant no legal cause for complaint, for, a license not having been withheld from him, his position is precisely the same as though the statute authorized the grant of a license to him and to appellee on equal terms. He is suffering, not from any application of the discriminatory feature of the statute, with which alone the Constitution is concerned, see Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Ct. 167; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134, 149\n, 39 S. Ct. 237, but merely from the increase in the number of his competitors, an injury which would similarly have resulted from a nondiscriminatory statute granting the privilege to all on terms more lenient than those formerly accorded appellant. Of such a statute, appellant could not complain and I can find no more basis for saying that constitutional rights are impaired where the discrimination which the statute authorizes has no effect, than where the statute itself does not discriminate.\n Nor would appellant seem to be placed in any better position to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by recourse to the rule that the possessor of a nonexclusive franchise may enjoin competition unauthorized by the state. Appellee's business is not unauthorized. It is carried on under the sanction of a statute to which appellant himself can offer no constitutional objection, for even unconstitutional statutes may not be treated as though they had never been written. They are not void for all purposes and as to all persons. See Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 27 S. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736. For appellant to say that appellee's permit is void, and that its business may be enjoined, because conceivably some on else may challenge the constitutionality of the act, would seem to be a departure from the salutary rule consistently applied that only those who suffer from the unconstitutional application of a statute may challenge its validity. See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, \n271 \nU.S. 50, 55\n, 46 S. Ct. 375; \n\n[278 U.S. 515, 553]\n\u00a0\n Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 34 S. Ct. 359; Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, \n179 \nU.S. 405, 410\n, 21 S. Ct. 206; Cusack Co. v. Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 530\n, 37 S. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1918A, 136, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 594; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540, 550\n, 32 S. Ct. 784; Mallinckrodt Chemical Works v. Missouri, \n238 \nU.S. 41, 54\n, 35 S. Ct. 671; Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390, 398\n, 36 S. Ct. 120.\n It seems to me that a fallacy, productive of unfortunate consequences, lurks in the suggestion that one may maintain a suit to enjoin competition of a business solely because hereafter some one else might suffer from an unconstitutional discrimination and enjoin it. But, more than that, even if the license had been withheld from appellant because he could not support the burden placed upon him by the statute, I should have thought it doubtful whether he would have been entitled to have had appellee's permit canceled-the relief now granted. He certainly could not have asked more than the very privilege which he now enjoys.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The stipulation of facts states: 'That W.

The type was called Rochdale because it was this type of organization which the pioneers of the present co-operation among English speaking peoples used there. This law which served as a pattern for most of the co-operative incorporation laws passed by other states prior to 1900 contained fewer of the safeguards to assure preservation of co-operative principles than does the Oklahoma act of 1919. No limitation was placed on the quantum of stock per member or on the voting privileges, and no restriction was placed on the amount of dividends to be paid on stock, the distribution of profits being left entirely to the by-laws and to the directors, save for the requirement that a portion of the earnings go into a reserve fund. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Pennsylvania, Public Laws 1868, Act 62; Minnesota, Laws 1870, c. 29; Michigan, Acts 1875, No. 75, amending Act 288 of 1865 so as to include agricultural co-operatives; Connecticut, Laws 1875, c. 62; California, Laws 1878, p. 883; New Jersey, Laws 1884, p. 63; Ohio, Laws 1884, p. 54; Kansas, Laws 1887, c. 116; Wisconsin, Laws 1887, c. 126; Montana, 1895, Code (1921),  6375-6385.

But such statutes do not purport to repeal earlier laws authorizing agricultural co-operation for other purposes which allow business for nonmembers. That the Legislatures recognize that the problems of co- operative marketing and of other types of agricultural co-operation require different treatment is demonstrated by the retention of general laws providing for agricultural co-operation after passage of the standard marketing act. In Oklahoma, for example, in the same year that the act of 1917 was amended so as to embody some of the features of the Bingham Act, the 1919 act was amended in unimportant particulars, thus receiving express legislative recognition of its continued usefulness.

The New York Law is known as the Co- operatives Corporations Law, and consolidates all prior acts for the formation of co-operative associations. Thus, marketing co-operatives, with or without capital stock, and other agricultural co-operatives, with or without capital stock, and with or without restrictions as to business for nonmembers, are all organized under the same act. \n[\nFootnote 30\n] Chris L. Christensen, Chief of the Department of Agriculture's Division of Co-operative Marketing, in Department Circular No. 403 (1926), says (page 2); '... The various forms which co-operative organizations have taken demonstrate the adaptability and extensive usefulness of this form of business organization.' And at page 3: 'A discussion of organization types is of value only when the conditions that make certain types necessary or valuable are taken into consideration. Attempts to build co-operative associations according to any special plan have met with failure in the past, and it is possible that in the future we shall see more rather than fewer types of co-operative organizations.' \n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] That the draftsmen of this law were influenced by the restrictions of the Clayton Act is evidenced by the fact that some of the language of section 2 of the 1917 act is taken verbatim from section 6 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  17). \n[\nFootnote 32\n] The Oklahoma state market commission, Carl Williams, editor of the Oklahoma Farmer-Stockman, and various farm organizations lent their assistance to the legislature in drafting this law. See Second Biennial Report of Oklahoma State Market Commission (1919-1920) p. 5; Carl Williams, Letter to Division of Co-operative Marketing, Department of Agriculture, dated January 21, 1929. The Oklahoma state market commission says of the 1919 Act (Marketing Bulletin, April 20, 1920, p. 5): 'In organizing these new corporations, the farmers had a real basis on which to organize. ... The law was written by men who understood the farmer's condition and had some practical knowledge of real co-operative marketing on a business basis. The laws of Minnesota, Nebraska, and other states were studied. Conditions under which co-operative associations had failed in the Northern states and those which had succeeded were taken into careful consideration. The best points from the laws of the several states, which would be suitable for Oklahoma conditions were incorporated and the features of these laws which were not suitable were eliminated.' \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] Laws 1923, c. 181. \n[\nFootnote 34\n] All figures here given are obtained from the files of the Department of Agriculture, Division of Co-operative Marketing. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] Two of the leading farm newspapers in Oklahoma are the Oklahoma Cotton Grower and the Oklahoma Farmer-Stockman, the latter edited by Carl Williams. In an editorial on February 10, 1926, the Cotton Grower urges farmers to form co-operative gins as the only way to obtain economy in ginning service. On March 1, 1927, the Farmer-Stockman contains an editorial urging, as a partial solution of the ginning problem, the placing of members on the Corporation Commission who are interested in the farmer as well as in the commercial gin. On May 15, 1927, the same paper notes the great increase in co-operative ginning in the state, and says that it is due to the extortionate prices charged by private ginners. On August 15, 1927, the Farmer-Stockman speaks of the meeting of the Corporation Commission to fix rates for ginning as the 'annual farce.' It is stated that the meeting is called a farce because the rate is always set high enough, so as to allow grossly excessive returns to the ginners at the expense of the farmers. The editor states that the only solution for the farmer is co-operation in ginning. On September 15, 1927, the same paper states that some privately owned gins have averaged a profit of over 100 per cent. on invested capital over a period of three years. On October 15, 1927, the Farmer-Stockman notes that poor ginning can cost the farmer at least 4 cents on each pound of cotton. \n[\nFootnote 36\n] The District Court said (26 F.(2d) 508, 519, 520): 'The ordinary commercial ginner within the state of Oklahoma may gin either as an individual, a co-partnership, or a corporation; no statute, rule, or provision of law restricts him in any wise in the enjoyment of the full proceeds of the earnings under the rate fixed. He usually is engaged, not only in ginning cotton, but also in the purchase of seed cotton, cotton seed after he has ginned the cotton, and frequently in the purchase of cotton after it is ginned for profit. A ginner has a greater facility to purchase the seed than anyone else. As he gins the cotton, he catches the seed as they fall from the stand, and has the immediate means for storage and housing same. The patron, if he does not elect to sell to the ginner, must receive them and haul them away, when as a rule he has no place for storage for accumulating as much as a carload, so as to sell them to advantage. A great per cent. of the gins so operated are owned and controlled by cotton seed crushers, operating cotton seed oil mills within the state of Oklahoma; such operation of gins not being entirely for the purpose of rendering a public service, but also for collecting cotton seed at a central point. Their gin business as ginners is incidental to that as crushers of seed, to the end that they may be enabled to purchase the seed under favorable conditions. See Choctaw Cotton Oil Co. v. Corporation Commission, 121 Okl. 51, 247 P. 390; Planters' Cotton & Glanning Co. v. West, 82 Okl. 145, 198 P. 855.' \n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL INS. CO. OF AMERICA v. NORTHERN PAC. RY. CO.(1929)\nNo. 23\nArgued: October 25, 1929Decided: November 25, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ralph S. Pierce and James B. Howe, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n Mr. Dennis F. Lyons, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The General Insurance Company of America, a Washington corporation, issued to Peter Agor, a citizen and resident of the state of Washington, two policies for $12,000 each, insuring him against loss or damage by fire \n\n[280 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n to wool and sacks contained in a warehouse situated in Benton county, Washington. While the policies were in full force, the warehouse and the wool and sacks contained therein were destroyed by a fire which started on the 2d of May, 1926, some time between 7 and 10 o'clock in the evening.\n Thereafter the insurance company made two payments to Agor, totaling $ 20,481.90, in discharge of its liability to him under the policies. May 14, 1926, Agor executed 'subrogation receipts' to the insurance company, in which he acknowledged receipt of the sum above mentioned in full settlement of his claims against the company for loss and damage caused by the fire, and by which he assigned and transferred to the insurance company his claims against any person or corporation which might arise, due to the loss and damage sustained by him, and by which the company was subrogated to the extent of the amount paid to him.\n Then the insurance company brought this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, in its amended complaint, a cause of action against the railway company under each policy and subrogation receipt, for the amount paid to Agor, with interest, on the ground that the loss was due to the negligence of the railway company in operating its railroad.\n The railway company denied that it was responsible for the fire or was guilty of negligence in respect to it.\n Trial was had; four witnesses were sworn and examined for the plaintiff, and the plaintiff rested. The counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit. The motion was granted and a judgment of dismissal entered. This was on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to indicate any facts sufficient to show negligence on the part of the defendant as alleged, or at all. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment 28 F.(2d) 574. \n\n[280 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n The facts were that the fire occurred at Badger, in the state of Washington. Badger was a small station on the Northern Pacific Railway southeast of Seattle, on the main line of the company. The warehouse which burned was 40 or 50 feet from the main tracks. The warehouse was possibly 50 feet wide and 200 feet long. The country about was sand and sagebrush. There was no blowing of the wind testified to, except at noon of the day of the fire. The fire was between half past 7 and 10 in the evening. There was no wind in the evening. A freight train of 70 cars passed going south between those hours. It was a double-header. Between Badger and the previous station, 7 miles away, there was a stiff upgrade from north to south, and there was a good deal of puffing and smoke between the two stations. The evidence is quite clear, however, that for a measurable distance before the train reached Badger the grade was either on the level or down hill. There was no evidence of the presence of sparks from the engine at the time of the fire or during the evening. About 20 minutes after the train had passed Badger, the fireman looked back and remarked to the engineer that there seemed to be a fire burning up all Badger. Badger was a lonely station. There was no station house there. There were only three employees of the railway company there, and only three or four shacks beside the warehouse. The fire occurred Sunday evening.\n The chief witness called by the insurance company testified he went to bed about 8 o'clock; that he was waked by the section foreman about 10 o'clock. The fire had begun at the southwest corner of the warehouse, some 50 feet away from the track, and, when he saw it, it was climbing from the ground up. The two or three men who were present were not able to do anything to put the fire out, and the building continued to burn until the next day. There is no other evidence of the circumstances \n\n[280 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n under which the fire took place. The warehouse was one which could be opened by a key that was usually left in the lock or in a hole near the door. There was evidence that there were people who resorted to the warehouse and slept there at times-sheep shearers and others; but no testimony shows that at the time of the fire there was any blowing of tumble weeds or other things which would convey fire. This is a case in which, if negligence is to be presumed, it must arise from the mere passing of the train followed by a fire. Nothing shows negligence by the engineer, the fireman, or the employees of the railway company. No one is able to suggest what it was that started the fire. There were many rats in the warehouse. There had been vagrants around it. At times people had seen tumble weeds blown about in a wind, but nothing of this kind indicates an occasion for a fire at the time when it took place.\n Counsel differ as to the law which should govern the decision in this case, whether Washington or federal (so called). In our judgment, it makes no difference.\n A leading case in Washington is that of Thorgrimson et al. v. Northern Pacific Ry. Company, 64 Wash. 500, 117 P. 406. That was an action for damages by the owner of a roofing plant situated about 80 feet south of the main line of the railway company, and the theory of the suit was that the railway company had negligently operated its train past the plant and caused the fire which destroyed the property of the plaintiff.\n The Supreme Court of the state said:\n'The rule putting the burden on the railway company to explain the cause of a fire following a passing engine, to which this court is probably committed (Overacker v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 64 Wash. 491, 117 P. 403, just decided) and which counsel relied on to carry the case to the jury on the questions of equipment and operation, is one of \n\n[280 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n necessity, and is applied so that justice may not be defeated. But we know of no cases going to the extent to which counsel would have us go to sustain their contention; that is, to presume negligence from the mere passing of the train followed by a fire. It is the proof of setting the fire, and not the fact that a building adjacent to a railroad right of way was burned, that raises the inference of negligence and shifts the burden of proof. In all the cases we have examined, including those from our own court, where the burden has been shifted from plaintiff to defendant, there has been some evidence from which the jury might infer with reasonable certainty that the fire would not have occurred unless set by the passing train. Counsel admitted on the trial and appellants now admit that they have no evidence other than circumstantial evidence.'\n\n The facts of the case before us do not show anything more than the passing of the train and the existence of fire 15 or 20 minutes afterwards. No connection is shown between the fire and the passing of the train except that of sequence. The principles of the Washington case cited would require a nonsuit in this case.\n Nor are the federal cases any more favorable to the petitioner. In McCullen v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company (C. C. A.) 101 F. 66, 49 L. R. A. 642, the action was to recover the value of property said to have been set on fire by sparks from the passing train on the defendant's road. The evidence was conflicting, and the effect of the decision was that where there was conflicting evidence as to whether the fire was set by sparks from a passing train, the case should be held to be one for a jury, and one in which a presumption would arise from the fact of causing the fire that there was negligence to be charged to the company. But that case differs from the one at bar, for the reason that there \n\n[280 U.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n was evidence there that the fire was occasioned by sparks from the engine. No such evidence appears here. There is entire absence of evidence here that the fire was created by the presence of any sparks.\n Another federal case is that of Garrett v. Sourthern Railway Company, 101 F. 102, 49 L. R. A. 645. It was there held by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit that, in an action by a railroad company for damages from fire alleged to have been set by sparks from the defendant's locomotive, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove, not only that the fire was caused by sparks from the defendant's engine, but that the emission of such sparks was due to defendant's negligence.\n In the present case we need not go so far. Both the circumstances that sparks caused the fire and that their presence was due to the negligence of the railroad company are absent. The case comes exactly within the rule laid down by this court in the Nitroglycerine Case, 15 Wall. 524, where Mr. Justice Field said:\n'Outside of these cases, in which a positive obligation is cast upon the carrier to perform safely a special service, the presumption is that the party has exercised such care as men of ordinary prudence and caution would exercise under similar circumstances, and if he has not, the plaintiff must prove it. Here no such proof was made, and the case stands as one of unavoidable accident, for the consequences of which the defendants are not responsible. The consequences of all such accidents must be borne by the sufferer as his misfortune.'\n\n We think the trial judge was right in granting a nonsuit and the Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGE VAN CAMP & SONS CO. v. AMERICAN CAN CO.(1929)\nNo. 94\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Solon J. Carter and Frederick E. Matson, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for George Van Camp & Sons Co.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Thompson, of Indianapolis, Ind., and Lemuel A. Welles, of New York City, for American Can Co.\n Mr. Henry H. Hornbrook, of Indianapolis, Ind., for Van Camp Packing Co., Inc.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal District Court for the District of Indiana to enjoin violations of section 2 of the Clayton Act. 38 Stat. 730, c. 323; U. S. Code, tit. 15,  13 (15 USCA  13). From a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity, an appeal was taken to the court below. Under section 239 of the Judicial Code as amended (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  346), that court has certified the following questions concerning which instructions are desired for the proper disposition of the cause:\n'Question 1. Does section 2 of the 'Clayton Act' (United States Code, title 15, section 13) have application to cases of price discrimination, the effect of which may be to substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, not in the line of commerce wherein \n\n[278 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n the discriminator is engaged, but in the line of commerce in which the vendee of the discriminator is engaged?\n\n'Question 2. Where one who makes an article and sells it, interstate, to persons engaged, interstate, in a line of commerce different from that of the maker, discriminates in price between such buyers (said discrimination not being made on account of differences in the grade, quality or quantity of the commodity sold, nor being made as only due allowance for the differences in the cost of selling or transportation, nor being made in good faith to meet competition) and the effect of such discrimination may to be substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the line of commerce wherein the buyers are engaged, does the maker and seller of the article, making such price discrimination, transgress section 2 of the 'Clayton Act' (United States Code, title 15, section 13)?'\n\n The relevant facts upon which the questions are based are set forth as follows:\n'The bill charges that appellant, George Van Camp & Sons Company, is engaged, interstate, in the business of packing and selling food products in tin cans, and that appellee Van Camp Packing Company is engaged in the same business, and is a competitor of appellant, and that appellee American Can Company manufactures, in very great quantities, and sells, interstate, to food packers, tin cans used in the food packing industry, and owns the monopoly for certain machines which are necessary for sealing the cans of its manufacture, and that it sells such cans in large quantities to appellant and to appellee Van Camp Packing Company, and leases to them its machines for sealing these cans.\n\n'That the American Can Company is unlawfully discriminating between different purchasers of its commodities, in that the price at which it offered and offers and sold \n\n[278 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n and sells its said cans to appellee Van Camp Packing Company is 20 per cent. below its publicly announced standard prices and the prices at which it contracted to sell and did and does sell its cans of the same kind to appellant, George Van Camp & Sons Company; that the American Can Company furnishes food packers, including appellant, its machines necessary for sealing its said cans at a fixed rental, and furnishes the same machines to the Van Camp Packing Company free of charge; that the American Can Company paid and pays the Van Camp Packing Company large sums of money by way of bonus, discounts, and reductions from the price of cans fixed in contracts between them, none of such bonus, discounts, or reductions being allowed or paid to appellant; and that these discriminations were and are not made on account of differences in grade, quality, or quantity of the commodity sold, nor of the machines leased, nor on account of any difference in the cost of selling or transportation, nor made in good faith to meet competition.\n\n'That the effect of such discrimination is to substantially lessen competition, and tends to create a monopoly in the line of interstate commerce, in which the appellant, George Van Camp & Sons Company, and the appellee Van Camp Packing Company are both engaged, namely, the packing and selling of food products in tin cans.\n\n'There is no allegation in the bill that the discriminations complained of tended to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition in the line of commerce in which the appellee American Can Company is engaged.\n\n'On separate motions of the several appellees on the ground that said section 2 of the Clayton Act is addressed only to discriminations in price the effect of which may be to substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly in the business in which the discriminator is engaged, the District Court dismissed the bill for \n\n[278 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n want of equity, and the appeal is from the decree of dismissal.'\n\n Section 2, copied in the margin,1 provides that it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to discriminate in price between different purchasers ... where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. As applied to the present case, the word 'commerce' as there used means interstate commerce. Clayton Act,  1 (15 USCA  12).\n The pertinent facts, shortly stated, are: That George Van Camp & Sons Company, the complainant, and the Van Camp Packing Company are both engaged in the business of packing and selling food products in tin cans in interstate commerce. The American Can Company manufactures tin cans used in the food-packing industry and sells such cans to the other two companies and leases to them machines for sealing the cans. It sells to the packing company at a discount of 20 per cent. below the announced standard prices at which it sells cans of the same kind to the complainant; it charges complainant a \n\n[278 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n fixed rental for the sealing machines, but furnishes them to the packing company free of charge; and it discriminates in other respects. The effect of the discrimination is to substantially lessen competition, and its tendency is to create a monopoly, in the line of interstate commerce in which complainant and the packing company are competitively engaged.\n These facts bring the case within the terms of the statute, unless the words 'in any line of commerce' are to be given a narrower meaning than a literal reading of them conveys. The phrase is comprehensive and means that if the forbidden effect or tendency is produced in one out of all the various lines of commerce, the words 'in any line of commerce' literally are satisfied. The contention is that the words must be confined to the particular line of commerce in which the discriminator is engaged, and that they do not include a different line of commerce in which purchasers from the discriminator are engaged in competition with one another. In support of this contention, we are asked to consider reports of congressional committees and other familiar aids to statutory construction. But the general rule that 'the province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity,' Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 419\n, 421 S., 20 S. Ct. 155, 158 (44 L. Ed. 219), is too firmly established by the numerous decisions of this court either to require or permit us to do so. The words being clear, they are decisive. There is nothing to construe. To search elsewhere for a meaning either beyond or short of that which they disclose is to invite the danger, in the one case, of converting what was meant to be open and precise, into a concealed trap for the unsuspecting, or, in the other, of relieving from the grasp of the statute some whom the Legislature definitely meant to include. Decisions of this court, where the letter of the statute was not deemed controlling and the legislative intent was determined by a consideration of circumstances \n\n[278 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n apart from the plain language used, are of rare occurrence and exceptional character, and deal with provisions which, literally applied, offend the moral sense, involve injustice, oppression or absurdity, United States v. Goldenberg, \n168 \nU.S. 95, 103\n, 18 S. Ct. 3; or lead to an unreasonable resuit, plainly at variance with the policy of the statute as a whole, Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, 43 S. Ct. 65. Nothing of this kind is to be found in the present case. The fundamental policy of the legislation is that, in respect of persons engaged in the same line of interstate commerce, competition is desirable and that whatever substantially lessens it or tends to create a monopoly in such line of commerce is an evil. Offense against this policy, by a discrimination in prices exacted by the seller from different purchasers of similar goods, is no less clear when it produces the evil in respect of the line of commerce in which they are engaged than when it produces the evil in respect of the line of commerce in which the seller is engaged. In either case, a restraint is put upon 'the freedom of competition in the channels of interstate trade which it has been the purpose of all the anti- trust acts to maintain.' Federal Trade Comm v. Beech-Nut Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 42 S. Ct. 150, 155 (66 L. Ed. 307, 19 A. L. R. 882).\n We have not failed carefully to consider Mennen Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 288 F. 774 (followed in National Biscuit Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 299 F. 733), cited as contrary to the conclusion we have reached. The decision in that case was based upon the premise that the statute was ambiguous and required the aid of committee reports, etc., to determine its meaning, a premise which we have rejected as unsound.\n Both questions submitted are answered in the affirmative.\n Question No. 1, Yes.\n Question No. 2, Yes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For opinion conforming to answers to certified questions, see 30 F.( 2d) 1011. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities, which commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, where the effect of such discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monoply in any line of commerce: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent discrimination in price between purchasers of commodities on account of differences in the grade, quality, or quantity of the commodity sold, or that makes only due allowance for difference in the cost of selling or transportation, or discrimination in price in the same or different communities made in good faith to meet competition: And provided further, that nothing herein contained shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their own customers is bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade.' \n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILCHRIST v. INTERBOROUGH RAPID TRANSIT CO.(1929)\nNo. 159\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Irwin Untermyer, of New York City (Messrs. Samuel Untermyer and Charles Dickerman Williams, both of New York City, on the brief), for Transit Commission of New York.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 159, 171]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Nicholson, Charles L. Craig, Joseph A. Devery, and Edgar J. Kohler, all of New York City, for City of New York.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 159, 177]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, James L. Quackenbush, William L. Ransom, and Jacob H. Goetz, all of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 159, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This direct appeal is from an order of May 10, 1928, by the District Court, Southern District of New York, three judges sitting, which authorized an interlocutory injunc- \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 190]\n\u00a0\n tion to restrain appellants-the Transit Commission and New York City-from requiring, or attempting to enforce, further acceptance by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company of a five-cent passenger fare over the lines operated by it and from seeking to prevent a charge of seven cents. This court stayed the order pending further hearing. The cause has been twice orally argued before us and helpful briets are on file.\n In support of the action below appellees maintain: The five-cent fare originally stipulated and long observed had become noncompensatory. Although specified in the agreements with the city under which the transit lines are being operated, that fare was not immutable, since, by implication, provisions of the Public Service Law of 1907 directing that reasonable rates should be granted to subways, elevated and other street railways were incorporated into the contracts. The Transit Commission in effect denied an application for compensatory rates, insisted upon observance of the five-cent one and intended to take immediate steps to secure enforcement of it. This amounted to action by the state which would deprive the Interborough Company of property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The city of New York is a municipal corporation, whose charter vests control of streets and other executive powers in the board of estimate and apportionment. The Transit Commission of three members created by chapter 134, New York Laws 1921, exercises powers theretofore intrusted to the Public Service Commission for the First District (chapter 429, Laws 1907) successor to the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners organized under the Rapid Transit Act of 1891 (Laws 1891, c. 4).\n The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, a New York corporation, with $ 35,000,000 capital stock, operates elevated and subway lines in four boroughs of Greater \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 191]\n\u00a0\n New York City. Some of these it owns; some the city owns and lets to it for operation; others-the original elevated lines-it hired in 1903 from the Manhattan Railway Company for 999 years, agreeing to pay therefore interest on $45,000,000 of outstanding bonds, 7 per cent. (now 5 per cent.) on $60,000,000 capital stock of the lessor, and $35,000 annually for administrative expenses. At this time the total yearly payments for use of elevated lines is about $4,900,000.\n Greater New York City contains five boroughs-Manhattan coterminous with Manhattan Island (10 miles long) with area of 19 square miles; the Bronx, 41 square miles; Queens, 117; Brooklyn, 80; and Richmond (Staten Island), 57. The population of the city in 1910 was 4,785,000 (in 1927, 5, 970,000), of whom 2,330,000 resided within Manhattan, in the southern portion of which are located the great business centers of the metropolitan district. The Bronx, on the mainland north of Harlem River, and Queens and Brooklyn on Long Island, have undergone very rapid development and increased greatly in population since 1900. The expanse of the greater city, together with its peculiar physical characteristics, render exceedingly difficult any effort to provide rapid and cheap transportation for its residents and the crowds of outsiders who travel therein daily for business or pleasure. See Sun Publishing Ass'n v. City of New York, 152 N. Y. 257, 273, 46 N. E. 499, 37 L. R. A. 788.\n Prior to 1903, under franchises dating from 1875, the Manhattan Railway, or its predecessors, constructed, owned, and operated the four original elevated railway lines extending northward from South Ferry along Second, Third, Sixth and Ninth avenues. All these were leased by the Interborough Company in 1903 and now constitute the oldest part of its system. Long before and ever since 1913 they have charged five cents per passenger and from this the lessee for many years derived substantial net \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 192]\n\u00a0\n profits. During 1910 and 1911 the average was $1,589,348.\n The subway first constructed begins at City Hall, Manhattan, and extends northward to Ninety-Sixth street-6 miles. \n1\n From the latter point two branches diverge; one continues north across Harlem River to 230th street, in the Bronx-7 miles; the other (West Farms Branch) runs northeast and under Harlem River to 182d street at Bronx Park-7 miles. These lines were constructed for the city, became its property and were let to the Interborough's assignor under 'contract No. 1,' executed February 21, 1900, 2 and authorized by the Rapid Transit Act of 1891 as amended.\n This contract-an elaborate instrument of 125 printed pages-provided with great detail that the lessee should equip and thereafter operate the road at its own expense under direction of the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners, and further undertook to secure uninterrupted service. Among other things it declared: 'The contractor (Interborough's assignor) shall during the term of the lease be entitled to charge for a single fare upon the railroad the sum of five (5) cents, but not more. The contractor may provide additional conveniences for such passengers as shall desire the same upon not to exceed one (1) car upon each train, and may collect from each passenger in such car a reasonable charge for such additional convenience furnished him, provided that the amount to be charged therefor and the character of such additional convenience shall from time to time be subject to the approval of the board. The contractor may provide not to exceed one (1) car in each train for persons smoking.' \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 193]\n\u00a0\n The lease was for 50 years (with right of renewal), the rent a sum equal to the annual interest on city bonds issued to secure the necessary funds for construction, plus 1 per centum for amortization. The lessee retained title to all equipment and the city agreed to purchase this at fair value when the lease ended.\n Construction under contract No. 1 cost the city around $60,000,000.3\n By 'contract No. 2,' dated July 21, 1902, the city contracted with the Interborough's assignor for the construction and operation during 35 years (with privilege of renewal) of an extension to the first subway, commencing at City Hall, Manhattan, and extending under East River to Borough Hall and thence to Atlantic avenue, Brooklyn-4 miles. The lessee undertook to furnish equipment, act under direction of the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners, and to pay for use of the lines a sum equal to the interest on bonds issued by the city to meet construction costs, plus 1 per centum for amortization; also to carry out the proposal that passengers should have the right to transportation without change of cars and for a single fare not exceeding five cents for one continuous trip over the railroad and connecting lines. A clause identical with the one above quoted from contract No. 1 prescribed a five-cent fare; another provision obligated the city to purchase the equipment when the lease terminated.\n For the construction of this extension the city paid out $6,600,000.\n Under contracts 1 and 2 ways extending over approximately 24 miles ( 75 of single track) were constructed and then equipped. The longest pos- \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 194]\n\u00a0\n sible continuous trip by a passenger was 17.4 miles. For equipping them the lessee claims a capital investment of $60,000,000; but large items are questioned and the true sum may be less than $40,000,000. This equipment, with real estate valued at $300,000 and office sundries, is all the property connected with the subways which the Interborough now owns. The lines were opened for traffic October 27, 1904, and prior to 1919 their operation yielded annually large net profits.\n The court below thought that, unless modified by contract No. 3, infra, contracts Nos. 1 and 2 established an inflexible five-cent fare, and this view has not been seriously questioned here.\n In order to meet the insistent demand for quick transportation, after prolonged negotiations, the Public Service Commission, acting for the city with approval of the board of estimate (being specially authorized by the Rapid Transit Act as amended in 1912 (Laws N. Y. 1912, c. 226)), entered into elaborate separate, but related agreements (dated March 19, 1913) with the Interborough and Manhattan Companies for (1) the construction and operation of extensions to the old lines and certain new subways-'contract No. 3'; (2) a third track on the elevated lines-'third track certificate'; ( 3) extensions to the elevated lines-'extension certificate'; (4) for operation of elevated trains over designated portions of the new subways- 'supplementary agreement.'\n Contract No. 3-122 printed pages-with great detail provided for immediate (and possible future) extensions of and additions to the subway system then existing, also their equipment and operation until the end of 1967. Under it the following lines were constructed, equipped and put into operation. \n4\n (1) From the end of old sub- \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 195]\n\u00a0\n way in Brooklyn eastwardly with two branches-9 miles. (2) From Borough Hall, Brooklyn, northwesterly under East River and lower Manhattan to Seventh avenue and thence north to Forty-Second street. (Times Square)-6 miles. (3) The Queensboro Bridge Line from Times Square eastward under Forty-Second street through Steinway Tunnel under East River to Queensboro Bridge Plaza and beyond-12 miles. (4) From Grand Central Station northward along Lexington avenue, under the Harlem and beyond, with two branches-18 miles. (5) An extension of West Farms Branch northward-5 miles.\n Fifty miles of subways were thus added to the original system-146.8 miles of single track. The longest distance between terminals became 26.78 miles. For the construction of these additions and extensions the city expended from its own treasury $113,000,000 and the Interbrough Company advanced $58,000,000. For equipment the latter paid not above $62,000,000. Title to both road and equipment vested in the city, and both were let to the Interborough Company until December 31, 1967, for operation in conjunction with the older subways. The lessee owns none of the equipment provided under this contract, and is not obligated thereby to pay anything to the city as rental for the ways; but it did agree to make certain payments out of the earnings after named deductions are satisfied. The leases under contracts 1 and 2 were adjusted to expire with 1967\n\n\n The following provisions of 'contract No. 3' are of special importance here:\n'Article I. ... The city and the lessee further agree upon the modification of contract No. 1 and contract No. 2 in the respects herein set forth, but nothing in this contract shall be construed as a modification or waiver of any of the rights or obligations of the respective parties under contract No. 1 and contract No. 2, except in the respect and to the extent herein specifically set forth.' \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 196]\n\u00a0\n (Certain modifications of Nos. 1 and 2 are specified, but the five- cent fare provisions are not mentioned.)\n\n'Article III. This contract is made pursuant to the Rapid Transit Act which is to be deemed a part hereof as if incorporated herein.'\n\n'Article XLIX. ... The gross receipts from whatever source derived directly or indirectly by the lessee or on its behalf in any manner from, out of or in connection with the operation of the railroad and the existing railroads (old subways), hereinafter referred to as the 'revenue,' shall be combined during the term of this contract and the city shall receive for the use of the railroad at the intervals provided a specified part or proportion of the income, earnings or profits of the railroad and the existing railroads. ...' (Broadly speaking, the part payable to the city is to be ascertained as follows: The Interborough Company shall deduct and retain each year sums sufficient to pay rentals on old lines required by contracts 1 and 2, say $3,000,000; taxes; operating expenses; maintenance; depreciation; $6,335,000, the estimated average profit derived during the years 1911-1912 from operation of the old lines under contracts 1 and 2; 6 per cent. on $80,000,000 advanced for construction and paid for original equipment under contract No. 3; interest on other cost of equipment. These are cumulative. Thereafter the city shall receive 8.76 per cent. on the cost of construction paid out under contract No. 3. The remainder will be equally divided between the city and the Interborough.)\n\n'Article LIV. The payment of the rental (to city) for the existing railroads referred to in paragraph 1(a) of article XLIX shall be made as provided in contract No. 1 and contract No. 2 for the full term of such contracts as herein modified. ...'\n\n'Article LIX. The lessee shall operate the railroad (to be constructed) and the existing railroads (those \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 197]\n\u00a0\n constructed under contracts 1 and 2) as one complete system and shall furnish with respect thereto such service and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable. Free transfers shall be given, as required by the commission ... so as to afford a continuous trip in the same general direction for a single fare.'\n\n'Article LXII. The lessee shall during the term of the contract be entitled to charge for a single fare upon the railroad (to be constructed) and the existing railroads the sum of five (5) cents but not more.'\n\n'Article LXXVIII. Upon giving one year's notice in writing to the lessee the city, acting by the commission with the approval of the board of estimate, may terminate this contract as to all the railroad ( to be constructed), including extensions and additions, at any time after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date when operation of any part of the railroad shall actually begin; or the city, acting by the commission, upon like notice and with like approval may terminate (certain specified) portions thereof. ...' (In the event of such termination the city agreed to pay the lessee a varying per centum, never above 115 per cent., of amounts contributed towards cost of construction or for equipment.)\n\n The 'third track certificate' authorized the Manhattan Railway Company (owner of original elevated lines), subject to definitely prescribed conditions, terms and requirements, to lay third tracks on the Second, Third, and Ninth Avenue Lines for accommodation of express trains.\n The 'extension certificate' authorized the Interborough Company to construct and operate four defined connections between the old elevated and the new subway lines. It carefully specified conditions intended to insure uninterrupted operation and protect the parties and contained the following clause:\n\n\n[279 U.S. 159, 198]\n\u00a0\n 'The Interborough Company shall be entitled to charge for a single fare for each passenger for one continuous trip in the same general direction over the railroads (including the parts of the municipal railroad over which the Interborough Company is provided with trackage rights as in this Certificate provided) and the additional tracks (which shall mean the additional tracks authorized by the commission by certificate to the Manhattan Railroad Company bearing even date herewith) and the Manhattan Railroad the sum of five (5) cents but not more. ...'\n There is also a provision for terminating the right to operate elevated trains over the extensions and additions and for taking them by the city upon payment of varying percentages of their cost, never exceeding 115 per cent.\n These extensions and connections rendered possible the operation of trains far beyond the original extremities of the old elevated lines over roads in the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx belonging to the city.\n By the 'supplementary agreement,' the city granted to the Interborough Company the right to use certain parts of subways constructed under contract No. 3 in connection with the elevated roads extended as above shown and reserved as possible compensation a named per centum of any increased receipts.\n January 1, 1919, all the lines, both elevated and subway, were constructed, equipped, and in operation with uniform five-cent fare.\n The record indicates that when this suit was begun the city had expended from its own treasury for construction of subways $180,000,000; that the Interborough Company had advanced for such construction $58,000, 000, and had expended for equipment not above $120,000,000-probably much less. The cost to the Interborough for laying third tracks on the elevated lines and building extensions thereto was $44,000,000. The original cost of the \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 199]\n\u00a0\n old elevated lines is not disclosed and perhaps cannot be definitely ascertained; it did not exceed $90,000,000. Expenditures under contract No. 3 greatly exceeded estimates; and the cost of operation has been much higher. The present values of the above-mentioned properties is very large, but to determine this with fair accuracy would be exceedingly difficult.\n The following excerpts from an affidavit offered by the city are enlightening. The record supports the facts and figures used so far as here important; also in general the stated conclusions.\n'The operation under contract No. 3 has been highly profitable to the Interborough, as was the prior operation under contracts Nos. 1 and 2. For the year ended June 30, 1926, the Interborough realized from the subway operation a net surplus of $6,569,573.03 after the payment of all operating expenses, taxes, interest, and other fixed charges, including the rentals of $2,655,186.26 to the city under contracts Nos. 1 and 2. The surplus is the amount available for the payment of dividends upon the capital stock of the company so far as subway operation by itself is concerned. The amount of total capital stock outstanding is $35,000,000 . ... The subway earnings alone, therefore, under contract No. 3, provide for dividend payments of over 18 per cent. on the par value of the stock. ...\n\n'For 1927 the surplus amounted to $6,380,017.34. (The decline was due to a strike.)\n\n'For the current fiscal year ended June 30, 1928, the figures for the first six months are available and show a net surplus amounting to $3,687, 000, which exceeds the surplus for the corresponding six months of the fiscal year before by $1,609,000.\n\n'These earnings are, of course, enormous and leave no room for claim that the five-cent fare fixed by contract No. 3 is inadequate to give a fair return upon the investment of the company in the subway properties, or \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 200]\n\u00a0\n that the five-cent fare is without due regard of the rights of the company under the contract. ...\n\n'The financial difficulties of the Interborough during the past eight years, have been due to the elevated lease from the Manhattan Railroad Company, and not to the subway contract with the city. The terms of the elevated lease provide that the Interborough must pay as rental the interest upon the Manhattan Railway Company bonds outstanding and dividends after an initial period, at 7 per centum upon the capital stock. The dividend rate, however, was adjusted in 1922 so that the Interborough is now paying 5 per centum upon about 94 per centum of the capital stock, only if and as earned by the Interborough, and 7 per centum upon the minority interest. The Manhattan Railway Company bonds outstanding amount to about $45,000,000 and the capital stock to $60,000,000. ... In 1927, the interest payments on the bonds amounted to $1,808,240 and the dividends on the stock to $3,086,756. In addition to these amounts, however, the Interborough must pay also interest and sinking fund charges on its own bonds and notes issued for the third tracking, the extension of the elevated lines, and other improvements. The total fixed charges resting on the elevated division, including the dividend rentals, amounted for the year ended June 30, 1926, to $8,062,274.85. The income above operating expenses and taxes available for these charges, was only $3,936, 396.50. The net revenues from the elevated fell short of earning all charges, including the dividends to the Manhattan Railway stockholders, by $ 4,125,878.35. For the year ended June 30, 1927, the corresponding shortage amounted to $4,909,129.66.\n\n'... The elevated and subway operations have been kept financially distinct. The revenues, expenses, taxes and fixed charges have been segregated, so that each system has had its own financial set-up under the contract controlling its operation. ... \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 201]\n\u00a0\n 'Notwithstanding the extreme crowding which has existed for several years on the trunk subway lines, the number of passengers has increased steadily upon the subways, while on the elevated it has been decreasing. Since 1920 the transportation revenue (on subways) at a five-cent fare has increased from $29,300,000 to $40,731,000 in 1927. For the first six months of the current fiscal year, the subway revenue was $21,433,000, compared with $18,647,000 for the same six months the year before; the growth is still continuing unimpeded.\n\n'On the elevated lines the total transportation revenues in 1920 amounted to $18,450,000 and for the year ended June 30, 1927, to $17,951, 000. During the first six months of the current fiscal year the elevated transportation revenues were $8,874,000, compared with $9,098,000 for the same six months the year before. The decline has not stopped. ...'\n\n In 1891 the Legislature of New York enacted what is known as the 'Rapid Transit Act' to 'provide for Rapid Transit Railways in cities of over one million inhabitants,' intended to meet the special needs of New York City, the only municipality with so large a population. It has been amended some forty times. Originally no provision permitted construction of railways at public expense-only privately-owned lines were contemplated. A Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners with general supervisory powers over the construction and operation of rapid transit lines was authorized and given authority to contract concerning fares; also to issue 'extension certificates' upon such terms, conditions, and requirements as might appear just and proper. In 1894 (Laws N. Y. 1894, c. 752) an amendment directed that the question whether the city should construct rapid transit facilities at its own expense be submitted to the voters, and further provided:\n'In case it shall be determined by vote of the people as provided by sections 12 and 13 of this act, to construct \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 202]\n\u00a0\n by and at the city's expense, then and in that event the road or roads so constructed shall be and remain the absolute property of the city so constructing it or them, and shall be and be deemed to be a part of the public streets and highways of said city, to be used and enjoyed by the public upon the payment of such fares, and tolls, and subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as may be imposed and provided for by the Board of Rapid Transit Railway Commissioners . ...'\n\n'The said board, for and in behalf of said city, shall enter into a contract with any person, firm or corporation, which in the opinion of said board shall be best qualified to fulfill and carry out said contract, for the construction of such road or roads. ...'\n\n'Such contract shall also provide that the person, firm or corporation so contracting to construct said road or roads shall, at his or its own cost and expense, equip, maintain and operate said road or roads for a term of years to be specified in said contract, not less than thirty-five, nor more than fifty years, and upon such terms and conditions as to the rates of fare to be charged and the character of service to be furnished and otherwise as said board shall deem to be best suited to the public interests, and subject to such public supervision and to such conditions, regulations and requirements as may be determined upon by said board.'\n\n The voters approved the proposal. On February 21, 1900, and July 21, 1902, contracts Nos. 1 and 2 were executed, and the lines therein specified were constructed and put into operation.\n In 1906 (Laws N. Y. 1906, c. 472) the Rapid Transit Act was so amended as to require approval by the board of estimate and apportionment of all contracts for construction, equipment, maintenance or operation of rapid transit railways built at public expense. Another amendment (chapter 498, Laws of 1909) authorized the termination of operating contracts and the \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 203]\n\u00a0\n taking by the city of the equipment upon payment of cost and not exceeding 15 per cent. In 1912, as specially requested by the board of estimate and with full knowledge of the circumstances, the Legislature enacted the Wagner Bill which amended the Rapid Transit Act, so as definitely to authorize the contracts and certificates, finally signed March 19, 1913 and above described, whose provisions, after long negotiations, had been tentatively agreed upon prior to the amendment. Admiral Realty Co. v. City of New York, 206 N. Y. 110, 99 N. E. 241, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 1054.\n Concerning extension certificates section 24 of the amended act declares: '4. The certificate or certificates prepared by the commission as aforesaid when delivered and accepted by such person, firm or corporation shall be deemed to constitute a contract between the said city and said person, firm or corporation according to the terms of the said certificate; and such contract shall be enforceable by the commission acting in the name of and in behalf of the said city or by the said person, firm or corporation according to the terms thereof, but subject to the provisions of this act. ...'\n The Public Service Commission Law, entitled 'An act to establish the public service commissions and prescribing their powers and duties, and to provide for the regulation and control of certain public service corporations and making an appropriation therefor,' chapter 429, Laws of 1907, became effective July 1, 1907. It authorized appointment of two commissions and directed: 'The jurisdiction, supervision, powers and duties of the Public Service Commission in the First District (New York City) shall extend under this act: 1. To railroads and street railroads lying exclusively within that district, and to the persons or corporations owning, leasing, operating or controlling the same. ...'\n This is a general law relative to regulation and control of public utilities throughout the state. It contains no \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 204]\n\u00a0\n words purporting to amend or modify the Rapid Transit Act except: Those abolishing the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners and directing that, in addition to other duties, '... the commission in the First District shall have and exercise all the powers heretofore conferred upon the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissions under chapter 4 of the Laws of 1891 entitled 'An act to provide for rapid transit railways in cities of over one million inhabitants,' and the acts amendatory thereto.' And 'all the powers and duties of such board shall thereupon be exercised and performed by the Public Service Commission of the First District.' Among other things it provides:\n'Sec. 26. Safe and adequate service; just and reasonable charges.- Every corporation, person or common carrier performing a service designated in the preceding section (railroads, street railroads, and common carriers), shall furnish, with respect thereto, such service and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable. All charges made or demanded by any such corporation, person or common carrier for the transportation of passengers, freight or property or for any service rendered or to be rendered in connection therewith, as defined in section two of this act, shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by law or by order of the commission having jurisdiction and made as authorized by this Act . ...'\n\n'Sec. 28. Every common carrier shall file with the commission having jurisdiction and shall print and keep open to public inspection schedules showing the rates, fares and charges for the transportation of passengers and property. ...'\n\n'Sec. 29. Unless the commission otherwise orders no change shall be made in any rate, fare or charge, or joint rate, fare or charge, which shall have been filed and published by a common carrier in compliance with the require- \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 205]\n\u00a0\n ments of this act, except after thirty days' notice to the commission and publication for thirty days. ... The commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes in rates without requiring the thirty days' notice and publication herein provided for. ... Whenever there shall be filed with the commission by any common carrier as defined in this act any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, fare or charge, ... the commission shall have and it is hereby given authority, ... upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the propriety of such rate, charge, fare, classification, regulation or practice; and pending such hearing and decision thereon, the commission upon filing with such schedule, and delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby, a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule. ...'\n\n'Sec. 49. ,1. Whenever either commission shall be of opinion, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon a complaint, that the rates, fares or charges demanded, exacted, charged or collected by any common carrier, railroad corporation or street railroad corporation , ... or that the maximum rates, fares or charges, chargeable by any such common carrier, railroad or street railroad corporation are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for the service rendered, and are unjust and unreasonable, the commission shall ... determine the just and reasonable rates, fares and charges to be thereafter observed and in force as the maximum to be charged for the service to be performed, notwithstanding that a higher rate, fare or charge has been heretofore authorized by general or special statute, and shall fix the same by order. ...'\n\n No provision of the Rapid Transit Act subjects it to the Public Service Commission Law. An amendment to the Railroad Law (chapter 481, Laws 1910) does this in respect of that enactment. People ex rel. Ulster, etc., R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 171 App. Div. 607, 156 N. Y. S. 1065. \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 206]\n\u00a0\n May 28, 1920, the Interborough Company, purporting to proceed under section 49, Public Service Law, complained to the commission that a five- cent fare on the subways was insufficient and asked a higher one. The petition was denied 'for want of jurisdiction to determine and fix a rate of fare different from that fixed by contract No. 3.' A proceeding begun in a state court to annul this order was discontinued before final hearing. Another application-March, 1922-for increased fares upon both elevated and subway lines was likewise denied for lack of jurisdiction. No review was sought. In 1925 the Interborough memorialized the Governor and Legislature, set out the result of operations under the five-cent fare, the refusal of the commission to grant any increase, and asked relief. No action was taken upon this application.\n February 1, 1928, the Interborough Company, adopting the method prescribed by section 29, Public Service Law, filed with the Transit Commission new schedules which purported to establish, effective March 3, 1928, a seven-cent fare upon all its lines and requested permission to put them into effect on five days' notice. Prior to February 14, 1928, the commission took no official action. But it appears that counsel for the commission and the mayor expressed the opinion that no relief should or would be granted, and perhaps used some threatening and ill-advised language; also that the members of the commission had concluded no relief could be granted, and that proceedings should be begun at once in a state court to enforce observance of the contract rate.\n At 9:20 a. m. February 14, 1928, the original bill now before us was filed. It alleged the five-cent rate had become confiscatory, that the commission had failed to grant relief, and asked an injunction against any attempt to enforce it, also against any interference with the establishment of a seven-cent fare.\n Later during the same morning the Transit Commission entered an order which denied its authority to grant \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 207]\n\u00a0\n any new rate and rejected the new schedules. It further directed counsel to institute suits in the state court to prevent threatened violation of law by the Interborough Company through failure to observe the contract rate. Thereupon, being already prepared, three proceedings were begun.\n On March 3, 1928, the Interborough Company filed a supplemental bill reciting the action taken by the commission subsequent to the filing of the original bill, renewed the prayer for relief by injunction and especially asked that further prosecution of the proceedings in the state court, be forbidden.\n Voluminous affidavits were submitted by both sides and upon these and the pleadings the District Court, three judges sitting, heard the cause and authorized the interlocutory injunction described above.\n Considering the entire record, we think the challenged order was improvident and beyond the proper discretion of the court.\n The record is voluminous; the contracts between the parties are complex; the relevant statutes intricate. No decision of this court, or of any court of New York, authoritatively determines the questions at issue. The basic one calls for construction of complicated state legislation.\n To support the action of the court below it would be necessary to show with fair certainty, first, that before the original bill was filed the commission had taken, or was about to take, some improper action in respect of the Interborough Company's new schedules or its application for leave to discontinue the five-cent rate and establish one of seven cents; and secondly, that the five-cent fare was so low as to be confiscatory while the proposed charge of seven cents was reasonable. We think neither of these things adequately appears from the record.\n At most, prior to the original bill, the commission's members had accepted the view that it lacked jurisdiction \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 208]\n\u00a0\n to permit a new rate because the existing one was irrevocably fixed by lawful contracts and had determined promptly to seek enforcement of the city's supposed rights by proceedings in the state courts. This was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. No ground existed for anticipating undue delay or hardship. The purpose of the commission was in entire accord with rulings announced as early as 1920 and seemingly no longer controverted when, in 1925, the Interborough applied for legislative relief. There had been abundant opportunity to test the point of law by appeal to the state courts.\n The power of the city to enter into contracts Nos. 1 and 2 was affirmed in Sun Publishing Ass'n v. City of New York, supra; likewise the validity of contract No. 3 was declared in Admiral Realty Co. v. City of New York, supra. These cases point out that the object of those contracts was to secure the operation of railways properly declared by statute to be part of the public streets and highways and the absolute property of the city.\n The statute under which the Interborough undertook to proceed gave 30 days after filing of the new schedules during which the commission might take action. The effect of the contracts, long the subject of serious disputation, depended upon the proper construction of state statutes-a matter primarily for determination by the local courts. The members of the commission intended to take official action appropriate to the circumstances, and neither what they did nor what they intended to do gave any adequate cause for complaint. Alleged newspaper stories and unbecoming declarations by counsel or city officials can not be regarded here as of grave importance.\n Under the doctrine approved in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 231\n, 29 S. Ct. 67, and Henderson Water Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 278\n, 46 S. Ct. 112, the Interborough Company could not have resorted to a federal court without first applying to the commission as pre- \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 209]\n\u00a0\n scribed by the statute; and having made such an application it could not defeat orderly action by alleging an intent to deny the relief sought.\n Both the bill of complaint and the argument of counsel here proceed upon the theory that under the law of New York, as clearly interpreted by definite rulings of her courts, the contracts for operating the transit lines impose no inflexible rate of fare. With this postulate we cannot agree. People ex rel. City of New York v. Nixon, 229 N. Y. 356, 128 N. E. 245, decided July 7, 1920, is especially relied upon; but the circumstances there were radically different from those now presented. The effect of a contract with the city, expressly authorized by amendment to the Rapid Transit Act adopted subsequent to enactment of the Public Service Commission Law, was not involved. The court carefully limited its opinion. And it said: 'The conditions of other franchises may supply elements of distinction which cannot be foreseen. Contracts made after the passage of the statute (Consol. Laws, c. 48 (Public Service Commission Law )) may conceivably be so related to earlier contracts either by words of reference or otherwise as to be subject to the same restrictions. We express no opinion upon these and like questions. They are mentioned only to exclude them from the scope of our decision. In deciding this case, we put our ruling upon the single ground that the franchise contract of October, 1912, was subject to the statute, and by the statute may now be changed.'\n Counsel for appellants refer with confidence to Parker v. Elmira, C. & N. R. Co., 165 N. Y. 274, 59 N. E. 81; Village of Ft. Edward v. Hudson Valley R. Co., 192 N. Y. 139, 84 N. E. 962; Quinby v. Public Service Commission, 223 N. Y. 244, 119 N. E. 433, 3 A. L. R. 685; People ex rel. Garrison v. Nixon, 229 N. Y. 575, 645, 128 N. E. 255; City of New York v. Brooklyn, etc., R. Co., 232 N. Y. 463, 134 N. E. 533.\n Although both the elevated and subway lines are operated by the same company, the two systems have been \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 210]\n\u00a0\n treated as separate and upon this record must be so regarded. The receipts from the subways show steady increase. If this continues, the Interborough Company ultimately will receive its entire investment on account of subways with large profits. The elevated roads, the present value of which for rate-making purposes is said to be above $150,000,000, are not prospering; their net receipts are diminishing. Appellees seek a seven- cent fare for all lines based upon alleged present values and the requirements of a supposed unified system.\n The claim for an 8 per cent. return upon the values of subways, which are the property of the city and distinctly declared by statute to be public streets (Sun Publishing Ass'n v. City of New York, supra), is unprecedented and ought not to be accepted without more cogent support than the present record discloses. The operating equipment supplied under contracts Nos. 1 and 2, which originally cost not over $60,000,000, real estate valued at $300,000 and office sundries of small value, is the only property connected with the subways to which the Interborough holds title; but it seeks remunderation based upon total values of all these ways and their equipment said to represent investments amounting to $360,000,000 and present value exceeding $600,000,000. At the current rate of return, after paying operating expenses, taxes, and rentals to the city, the Interborough will realize annually from the subways more than $17,000,000. The annual income of the elevated lines, after deducting operating expenses, maintenance, taxes, etc., probably will not hereafter exceed $4, 000,000, and as the Interborough must pay rentals therefor amounting to $4, 900,000, also interest on bonds, notes, etc. (issued for third tracks, extensions, etc.), in excess of $3,000,000, its loss by reason of this lease is heavy and apparently will increase.\n During 1927 passengers carried on the subway lines numbered 814,600, 000; on the elevated, 359,000,000; total, \n\n[279 U.S. 159, 211]\n\u00a0\n 1,173,600,000. An increase of two cents upon each fare would have added to the subway receipts $16,292,000; to the elevated, $7,180,000.\n The Transit Commission has long held the view that it lacks power to change the five-cent rate established by contract; and it intended to test this point of law by an immediate, orderly appeal to the courts of the state. This purpose should not be thwarted by an injunction. Upon the record before us we cannot accept the theory that the subways and elevated roads constitute a unified system for rate-making purposes. Considering the probable fair value of the subways and the current receipts therefrom no adequate basis is shown for claiming that the five-cent rate is now confiscatory in respect of them. The action below was based upon supposed values and requirements of all lines operated by the Interborough Company treated as a unit; and the effort to support it here proceeds upon a like assumption.\n The interlocutory order must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These and similar figures are mere rough approximations. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] This and subsequent contracts designate agreements for operation as leases. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These and similarly stated figures are intended only to give a fair idea of the problems presented; they do not indicate adjudication of any disputed question. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] These new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx are mostly above ground. \n\n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGLEASON v.

Ormonde Hunter, of Savannah, Ga., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, granted March 5, 1928, to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 21 F.(2d) 883, reversing a judgment for petitioner of the District Court for Southern Georgia.\n At the trial by jury, it appeared that respondent railway company has terminals for the receipt and delivery of freight both at Charleston, S. C ., and Savannah, Ga.; that McDonnell was an employee of respondent at its Savannah office, whose duty it was, and whose continuous practice it had been, to give notice to those engaged in the cotton trade, including petitioner, a cotton factor in Savannah, of the arrival of cotton at the Savannah terminal under 'order notify' bills of lading. There was evidence from which the jury could have found that on March 19, 1925, McDonnell, so acting, gave petitioner notice of arrival of a shipment of cotton under a designated order notify bill of lading; that later on the same day a local bank presented to petitioner the described bill of lading, regular in form and properly indorsed, with an attached draft on petitioner for $10,000, which petitioner paid in reliance upon the notice of arrival given by the agent and the apparent regularity of the documents; that, after presentation of the draft and before payment, McDonnell had again informed petitioner, in response to an inquiry, that the cotton described in the bill of lading had arrived. There was evidence also plainly \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n indicating that petitioner would not have paid the draft without that assurance. The draft and the bill of lading, purporting to be issued by respondent at its Charleston office, eventually proved to have been forged and negotiated by McDonnell in Charleston while temporarily absent from his duties in Savannah and his entire course of conduct with respect to them, including his false notice to petitioner, was in the successful pursuance of a scheme to defraud petitioner of the amount paid by it on the draft.\n The second count of petitioner's declaration, and the only one presently involved, set out a cause of action in deceit by McDonnell acting as the agent of respondent in giving the petitioner the false notice and set up that the petitioner was induced to pay the draft by the representation that the cotton had arrived. The court, disregarding any question of want of due care on the part of respondent, instructed the jury that, if it found that the false notice by McDonnell to petitioner was given within the scope of his authority and that petitioner had in fact been induced by the false statement to take up the draft, it should return a verdict for the petitioner. Judgment on the verdict for petitioner was reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that an employer is not liable for the false statements of an agent made solely to effect a fraudulent design for his own benefit and not in behalf of the employer or his business, the court saying (21 F.(2d) 884): 'Under the general rule prevailing in the federal courts, an employer is not liable for such conduct of his employee. Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n130 \nU.S. 416\n, 9 S. Ct. 570. ...'\n In the Friedlander Case the action was brought to recover for the nondelivery of merchandise, purported to have been received by the defendant carrier and covered by a bill of lading issued by its agent, admittedly author- \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n ized to issue bills of lading in the usual course of business. The bill had been fraudulently issued by the agent for his own enrichment, and the described merchandise had not, in fact, been received by the defendant or its agent. The court held that there was no implied authority in the agent to issue bills of lading for merchandise not actually received, and that there was consequently no contractual obligation on the part of the carrier. As the only act of the agent complained of, the issuance of the bill of lading, was thus held not to be within the scope of his authority, that holding was sufficient to dispose of the entire case. To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat. Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109, 119, 65 So. 1003; Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 42 Wash. 572, 576, 85 P. 53, 6 L. R. A. (N. S.) 302, 7 Ann. Cas. 728; contra Bank of Batavia v. New York, etc., R. R. Co., 106 N. Y. 195, 12 N. E. 433, 60 Am. Rep. 440. But the court in the Friedlander Case went on to say (\n130 \nU.S. 425\n, 9 S. Ct. 573):\n'... Nor is the action maintainable on the ground of tort. 'The general rule,' said Willes, J., in Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank, L. R. 2 Ex. 259, 265, 'is that the master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant or agent as is committed in the course of the service and for the master's benefit, though no express command or privity of the master be proved.' See also Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co., 1 H. & C. 526. The fraud was in respect to a matter within the scope of Easton's employment or outside of it. It was not within it, for bills of lading could only be issued for merchandise delivered; and being without it, the company, which derived and could derive no benefit from the unauthorized and fraudulent act, cannot be made responsible. British Mutual Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Railway Co., 18 Q. B. D. 714.'\n\n The rule, applied in that case, that the authority of an agent to issue bills of lading is impliedly conditioned upon the receipt of the merchandise described in the bill, has \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n now been modified by statute. Section 221 of the Federal Bills of Lading Act, 39 Stat. 542 (49 USCA  102), applicable to bills of lading of common carriers in interstate and foreign commerce, provides that the carrier, in certain enumerated cases, shall be liable on a bill so issued even though the merchandise is not received by the agent.\n But the above-quoted passage from that case, taken in conjunction with other references in the opinion to the fraudulent conduct of the agent for his own benefit, has been regarded as authority for the broader rule applied by the court below, and the present case must turn upon the sufficiency of the rule thus announced. For there was here no want of authority in the agent. His power to act for his principal was not contingent upon any act or omission of another. From the verdict, we must take it that it was his duty unconditionally to answer the inquiry of petitioner as to the arrival of the goods, and concededly, if acting within the scope of his employment, the respondent would have been liable, however flagrant the agent's act, had it not been tainted by his selfish motive. Nelson Business College v. Lloyd, 60 Ohio St. 448, 54 N. E. 471, 46 L. R. A. 314, 71 Am. St. Rep. 729; Aiken v. Holyoke St. Ry. Co., 184 Mass. 269, 68 N. E. 238; Binghampton Trust Co. v. Auten, 68 Ark. 299, 57 S. W. 936.\n The limitation upon the doctrine of respondeat superior applied by the court below finds little support other than in the passage quoted and in cases, chiefly in some of the \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n lower federal courts, purporting to follow it-see Harris, Irby & Vose v. Allied Compress Co. (C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 7, 9; American Surety Co. v. Pauly ( C. C. A.) 72 F. 470, 482; Dun v. City Nat. Bk. (C. C. A.) 58 F. 174, 179, 23 L. R. A. 687; cf. Leachman v. Bd. of Supervisors, 124 Va. 616, 624, 98 S. E. 656-but in those cases it was not necessary to the decision. The state courts, including those of Georgia, where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives. Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat. Bk., 78 Ga. 574, 3 S. E. 327; McCord v. Western Union Tel. Co., 39 Minn. 181, 39 N. W. 315, 1 L. R. A. 143, 12 Am. St. Rep. 636; Havens v. Bk. of Tarboro, 132 N. C. 214, 43 S. E. 639, 95 Am. St. Rep. 627; Reynolds v. Witte, 13 S. C. 5, 15, 36 Am. Rep. 678; Fifth Ave. Bk. v. Forty-Second St., etc., R. R. Co., 137 N. Y. 231, 33 N. E. 378, 18 L. R. A. 331, 33 Am. St. Rep. 712; Dougherty v. Wells, Fargo & Co., 7 Nev. 368. The English courts, after hinting at a departure from the rule as thus stated, British Mutual Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Ry., 18 Q. B. D. 714; cf. Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank, L. R. 2 Ex. 259, 265, have finally reached the same conclusion, Lloyd v. Grace (1912) A. C. 716.\n And we think that the restriction of the vicarious liability of the principal adopted by the court below is supported no more by reason than by authority. Undoubtedly formal logic may find something to criticize in a rule which fastens on the principal liability for the acts of his agent, done without the principal's knowledge or consent and to which his own negligence has not contributed. But few doctrines of the law are more firmly established or more in harmony with accepted notions of social policy than that of the liability of the principal without fault of his own. Shaw, C. J., in Farwell v. Boston & Worcester Railroad Corporation, 4 Metc. (Mass.) 49, 55, 38 Am. Dec. 339; Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Ried, 3 Macq. 266, 283. See Pollock, Torts (1887) 67, 68; Salmond, Jurisprudence ( 2d Ed. 1907) 381. The \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n tendency of modern legislation in Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Acts and in the Bills of Lading Act cited and of judicial decision as well, has been to enlarge rather than curtail the rule.\n Granted the validity and general application of the rule itself, there would seem to be no more reason for creating an exception to it because of the agent's secret purpose to benefit himself by his breach of duty than in any other case where his default is actuated by negligence or sinister motives. In either case the injury to him who deals with the agent, his relationship and that of the principal to the agent's wrongful act, and the economic consequence of it to the principal in the conduct of whose business the wrong was committed, are the same.\n The arguments in favor of creating such an exception are equally objections to the rule itself. Holmes, The Common Law (1882) 231, note 3. But, as we accept and apply the rule, despite those objections, we can find no justification for an exception which is inconsistent both with the rule itself and the underlying policy which has created and perpetuated it. We think that the Friedlander Case should be overruled so far as it supports such an exception, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n The court below also thought that Congress, by enacting section 22 of the Bills of Lading Act, to which we have referred, impliedly approved the rule now contended for by legislating on the subject and creating an exception to the rule, announced in the passage quoted from Friedlander Case, instead of abolishing it. But such a rule of statutory construction, whatever its scope and validity, has no application to the present case. Section 22 deals only with the former rule that agents having authority to receive merchandise and issue bills of lading were without implied authority to issue the latter except on receipt of the merchandise. It enlarged the agent's implied \n\n[278 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n authority by imposing a new liability on the principal for the agent's act in issuing the bill, even though the merchandise was not received. But respondent's liability here is not predicated on the agent's authority to issue bills, which, so far as appears, he did not have, but upon his authority to notify petitioner of the arrival or nonarrival of the merchandise, which he clearly did have. Congress, by enlarging in a Bills of Lading Act the implied authority of an agent to issue bills of lading, can hardly be said to have dealt by implication with a general rule of liability applicable in other classes of transactions not involving bills of lading.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 22. 'That if a bill of lading has been issued by a carrier or on his behalf by an agent or employee the scope of whose actual or apparent authority includes the receiving of goods and issuing bills of lading therefor for transportation in commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, the carrier shall be liable to (a) the owner of goods covered by a straight bill subject to existing right of stoppage in transitu or (b) the holder of an order bill, who has given value in good faith, relying upon the description therein of the goods, for damages caused by the nonreceipt by the carrier of all or part of the goods or their failure to correspond with the description thereof in the bill at the time of its issue.' \n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGONZALEZ v.

Gillespie, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. \n278 \nU.S. 588\n, 49 S. Ct. 17. The subject-matter is a collative chaplaincy in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila, which has been vacant since December 1910.1 The main questions for decision are whether the petitioner is legally entitled to be appointed the chaplain, and whether he shall recover the surplus income accrued during the vacancy.\n Raul Rogerio Gonzalez, by his guardian ad litem, brought the suit against the archbishop in the court of \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n first instance of Manila, on August 5, 1924. He prayed for judgment declaring the petitioner the lawful heir to the chaplaincy and its income; establishing the right of the petitioner and his successors to be appointed to and receive the income of the chaplaincy during their infancy whenever it may be vacant and, pending such appointment, to receive the income for their maintenance and support; declaring the trust character of the property and ordering it to be so recorded; directing the archbishop to appoint the petitioner chaplain and to account to him for the income of the property from 1910 on; and directing the defendant to pay the petitioner 1,000 pesos a month pending the final determination of the case. The trial court directed the archbishop to appoint the petitioner chaplain; and ordered payment to him of 173,725 pesos ($86,862.50), that sum being the aggregate net income of the chaplaincy during the vacancy, less the expense of having the prescribed masses celebrated in each year. It reserved to the petitioner any legal right he may have to proceed in the proper court for cancellation of the certificate of registration of the property in the name of the archbishop. The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands reversed the judgment on February 4, 1928, and absolved the archbishop from the complaint, 'without prejudice to the right of proper persons in interest to proceed for independent relief,' in respect to the income accrued during the vacancy, or in respect to the reformation of the certificate of registration so as to show the fiduciary character of the title. As the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, this court has jurisdiction on certiorari. Act Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229,  7, 43 Stat. 936, 940 (28 USCA  349).\n The chaplaincy was founded in 1820, under the will of Don a Petronila de Guzman. By it, she requested 'the father chaplain to celebrate sixty masses annually' in behalf of the souls of her parents, brothers, sisters, and \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n herself. The deed of foundation, which was executed by the testamentary executor of Don a Petronila, provided that 'said property is segregated from temporal properties and transferred to the spiritual properties of this archbishopric, without its being possible to alienate or convert the property as such into any other estate for any cause, even though it be of a more pious character, ... so that by virtue of this deed of foundation canonical collation may be conferred on the said appointed chaplain.' By appropriate proceedings an ecclesiastical decree approved 'the foundation of the chaplaincy with all the circumstances and conditions provided for in said clause (of the wall) and in the deed of said clause (of the will) and in the deed of of seventeen hundred pesos against said building, converting said sum into spiritual property of a perpetual character subject to the ecclesiastical forum and jurisdiction.'\n The will provided that the foundation should effect the immediate appointment as chaplain of D. Esteban de Guzman, the great-grandson of the testatrix, and 'in his default the nearest relative, and in default of the latter a collegian (colegial) of San Juan de Letran, who should be an orphan mestizo, native of this said town.' It named the president of that college as the patron of the chaplaincy. Esteban was appointed chaplain in 1820. From time to time thereafter four other descendants of the testatrix were successively appointed. The latest of these renounced the chaplaincy in December, 1910, married soon thereafter, and in 1912 became the father of the petitioner, Raul Rogerio Gonzalez, who is a legitimate son of the fifth chaplain, and claims to be the nearest relative in descent from the first chaplain and the foundress.\n Raul was presented to the archbishop for appointment in 1922. The archbishop refused to appoint him, on the ground that he did not then have 'the qualifications required for chaplain of the said chaplaincy.' He added: \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n 'The grounds of my conclusion are the very canons of the new Code of Canon Law. Among others, I can mention canon 1442, which says: 'Simple chaplaincies or benefices are conferred upon clergymen of the secular clergy,' in connection with canon 108, paragraph 1, 'Clergymen are those already initiated in the first tonsure,' and canon 976, paragraph 1, 'No one can be promoted to first tonsure before he has begun the course in theology.' In view of the canon as above mentioned, and other reasons which may be adduced, I believe that the boy, Raul Gonzalez, is not legally (ecclesiastically speaking) capacitated to the enjoyment of a chaplaincy.'\n Ever since the Council of Trent (1545-1563), it has been the law of the church that no one can be appointed to a collative chaplaincy before his fourteenth year. When Raul was presented for appointment, he was in his tenth year. He was less than 12 when this suit was begun. He was 14 when the trial court entered its judgment. It is also urged on behalf of the archbishop that at no time since that Council could one be lawfully appointed who lacked elementary knowledge of Christian doctrine.\n The new Codex Juris Canonici, which was adopted in Rome in 1917 and was promulgated by the church, to become effective in 1918, provides that no one shall be appointed to a collative chaplaincy who is not a cleric. Canon 1442. It requires students for the priesthood to attend a seminary; and prescribes their studies. Canons 1354, 1364. It provides that in order to be a cleric one must have had 'prima tonsura' (Canon 108, par. 1); that in order to have 'prima tonsura' one must have begun the study of theology ( Canon 976, par. 1); and that in order to study theology one must be a 'bachiller'-that is, must have obtained the first degree in the sciences and liberal arts (Canon 1365). It also provides that no one may validly receive ordination, unless in the opinion of the ordinary he \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n has the necessary qualifications. Canon 968, par. 1, 1464. Petitioner concedes that the chaplaincy here involved is a collative one, and that Raul lacked, at the time of his presentment and of the commencement of the suit, the age qualification required by the canon law in force when the chaplaincy was founded. \n2\n It is also conceded that he lacked, then and at the time of the entry of the judgment, other qualifications of a candidate for a collative chaplaincy essential, if the new Codex was applicable.\n Raul's contention, in effect, is that the nearest male relative in descent from the foundress and the first chaplain, willing to be appointed chaplain, is entitled to enjoy the revenues of the foundation, subject only to the duty of saying himself the sixty masses in each year, if he is qualified so to do, or of causing them to be said by a qualified priest and paying the customary charge therefor out of the income. He claims that the provisions of the new Codex are not applicable, and that his rights are to be determined by the canon law in force at the time the chaplaincy was founded, and that the judgment of the trial court should be reinstated, because he possessed at the time of the entry of the judgment all the qualifications required by the canon law in force in 1820. Raul argues that contemporaneous construction and long usage have removed any doubt as to what these qualifications were; that when the foundation was established, and for a long time thereafter, the ecclesiastical character of the incumbent was a minor consideration; that this is shown by the administration of this chaplaincy; and that his own ecclesiastical qualifications, at the time of the entry of the \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n judgment in the trial court, were not inferior to those of the prior incumbents. He asserts that, although chaplaincies were disamortized in Spain prior to 1867 (Alcubilla, Diccionario, Vol. II, p. 118), they had in the Philippines remained undisturbed by any legislation of Spain, and that the rights of the church were preserved by article 8, of the Treaty of Paris. 30 Stat. 1754, 1758; Ponce v. Roman Catholic Church, \n210 U.S. 296\n, 315-322, 28 S. Ct. 737. He contends that to deprive him of his alleged right to the chaplaincy because of a change made in 1918 in the canon law would violate the Constitution of the United States, the Treaty with Spain of 1898, and the Organic Act of the Philippine Islands ( 32 Stat. 691).\n The trial court rested its judgment for Raul largely on the ground that he possessed, at the time of its entry, the qualifications required by the canon law in force when the chaplaincy was founded, and that, hence, he was entitled both to be appointed chaplain and to recover the income accrued during the vacancy, even though he did not possess the qualifications prescribed by the new Codex then otherwise in force. The Supreme Court held that to give effect to the provisions of the new Codex would not impair the obligation of the contract made in 1820, as it was an implied term of the deed of foundation that the qualifications of a chaplain should be such as the church authorities might prescribe from time to time, and that, since Raul confessedly did not possess the qualifications prescribed by the new Codex which had been promulgated before he was presented, he could not be appointed.\n First. The archbishop interposes here, as he did below, an objection to the jurisdiction of the Philippine courts. He insists that, since the chaplaincy is confessedly a collative one, its property became spiritual property of a perpetual character subject to the jurisdiction of the ec- \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n clesiastical forum, and that thereby every controversy concerning either the right to appointment or the right to the income was removed from the jurisdiction of secular courts. The objection is not sound. The courts have jurisdiction of the parties. For the archbishop is a juristic person amenable to the Philippine courts for the enforcement of any legal right; and the petitioner asserts such a right. There is jurisdiction of the subject-matter; for the petitioner's claim is, in substance, that he is entitled to the relief sought as the beneficiary of a trust.\n The fact that the property of the chaplaincy was transferred to the spiritual properties of the archbishopric affects not the jurisdiction of the court, but the terms of the trust. Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 714, 729. The archbishop's claim in this respect is that by an implied term of the gift, the property, which was to be held by the church, should be administered in such manner and by such persons as may be prescribed by the church from time to time. Among the church's laws, which are thus claimed to be applicable, are those creating tribunals for the determination of ecclesiastical controversies. Because the appointment is a canonical act, it is the function of the church authorities to determine what the essential qualifications of a chaplain are and whether the candidate possesses them. In the absence of fraud, collusion, or arbitrariness, the decisions of the proper church tribunals on matters purely ecclesiastical, although affecting civil rights, are accepted in litigation before the secular courts as conclusive, because the parties in interest made them so by contract or otherwise. \n3\n Under like circumstances, effect is given in the courts to the determinations \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n of the judicatory bodies established by clubs and civil associations. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The archbishop contended that Raul lacked even the minimum of training and knowledge of Christian doctrine made indispensable by the canon law in force in 1820; that his confessed lack of the essential age at the time of the presentment and also at the time of the institution of the suit were insurmountable obstacles to the granting of the prayer for appointment to the chaplaincy; and, moreover, that the failure to take an appeal to the Pope from the decision of the archbishop, as provided by the canon law, precluded resort to legal proceedings. We have no occasion to consider the soundness of these contentions. For we are of opinion that the canon law in force at the time of the presentation governs, and the lack of the qualification prescribed by it is admitted. Neither the foundress, nor the church authorities, can have intended that the perpetual chaplaincy created in 1820 should, in respect to the qualifications of an incumbent, be forever administered according to the canons of the church which happened to be in force at that date. The parties to the foundation clearly contemplated that the archbishop would, before ordination, exercise his judgment as to the fitness of the applicant; and they must have contemplated that, in the course of the centuries, the standard of fitness would be modified.\n When the new Codex was promulgated in 1918, Raul was only six years old and had not yet been presented. If he had been presented, he obviously could not have been appointed. No right was then being enjoyed by him \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n of which the promulgation of the new Codex deprived him. When he was presented later, he was ineligible under the then existing canon law. In concluding that Raul lacked the qualifications essential for a chaplain the archbishop appears to have followed the controlling canon law. There is not even a suggestion that he exercised his authority arbitrarily.\n Third. Raul urges that, even though he is not entitled to be appointed chaplain, he is entitled to recover the surplus net income earned during the vacancy. Indeed, it is the property rights involved that appear to be his main consideration. The value of the property in 1820 was about 1,700 pesos. The annual net income was then 180 pesos, a sum sufficient only to defray the annual expense of 60 masses. The annual net income has grown to about 12,000 pesos, and the annual expense of the 60 masses does not now exceed 300 pesos. In each year during the vacancy the masses have been duly celebrated. The surplus income accruing during the vacancy has been used by the archbishop currently for pious purposes, namely, education. By canon 1481 of the new Codex, the surplus income of a chaplaincy, after deducting expenses of the acting chaplain, must one-half be added to the endowment or capital and one-half to the repair of the church, unless there is a custom of using the whole for some common good to the diocese. The use made of the surplus of this chaplaincy was in accordance with what was claimed to be the long established custom of the archdiocese. Both the custom and the specific application made of this surplus have been approved by the Holy See. The Supreme Court held that, since Raul had sought the income only as an incident of the chaplaincy, he could not recover anything.\n Raul's claim, which is made even in respect to income accrued prior to his birth, is rested upon some alleged right by inheritance, although his father is still living. \n\n[280 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n The intention of the foundress, so far as expressed, was that the income should be applied to the celebration of masses and to the living of the chaplain, who should preferably be the nearest male relative in the line of descent from herself or the first chaplain. The claim that Raul individually is entitled as nearest relative to the surplus by inheritance is unsupported by anything in the deed of gift or the applicable law. Since Raul is not entitled to be appointed chaplain, he is not entitled to a living from the income of the chaplaincy.\n Raul urges also an alleged right as representative of the heirs of the testatrix as a class. This suggestion was, we think, properly met by the ruling of the Supreme Court that the suit was not brought as a class suit. Whether the surplus income earned during the vacancy has been properly disposed of by the archbishop and what disposition shall be made of it in the future we have no occasion to inquire. The entry of the judgment without prejudice 'to the right of proper persons in interest to proceed for independent relief' leaves any existing right of that nature unaffected.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A chaplaincy in the Roman Catholic Church is an institution founded by an individual for the purpose of celebrating or causing to be celebrated annually a certain number of masses conforming to the will of the founder. Chaplaincies are commonly divided into two classes-lay and ecclesiastical. A laical or mercenary chaplaincy is one instituted without the intervention of ecclesiastical authority, does not require a title in order to be ordained, and is not subject to ecclesiastical authority. The ecclesiastical or collative chaplaincy, although also founded by an individual, is one erected into a benefice by the proper spiritual authority, requires a title of ordination, and is thus subject to ecclesiastical control. When the foundation of an ecclesiastical or collative chaplaincy calls for relatives of the founder to enjoy the chaplaincy, it is called colativa familiar. When individuals of a certain family are not called to the possession, but the patron is authorized to nominate, then the chaplaincy is called colativa simple or gentilicia. But whether the chaplaincy is colativa familiar or colativa simple, intervention of the proper spiritual authority to appoint and ordain is essential.

HARRIS(1929)\nNo. 116\nArgued: January 10, 1929Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. Streeter B. Flynn and Robert M. Rainey, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioners.\n Mr. Robert F. Blair, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was before us at an earlier stage in Grayson v. Harris, \n267 \nU.S. 352\n, 45 S. Ct. 317. \n\n[279 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n In August, 1917, the petitioners brought an action against the respondents in the district court of Creek county, Oklahoma, to recover an undivided half interest in certain lands in that county lying within the former Creek Nation in the Indian Territory. These lands had been allotted on July 9, 1906, in the names of two freedmen, Creek citizens, who had previously died; and the title to an undivided half interest in the lands had thereupon passed to Gertrude Grayson, a Creek citizen, who was an heir of each of the allotees. She died, intestate, and without issue, in April, 1907, leaving as her next of kin certain remote kindred who were Creeks, and a maternal grandmother who was not a Creek. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted as a State. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The plaintiffs alleged that upon the death of Gertrude Grayson the undivided half interest in the lands of which she had died possessed vested in fee in them as her surviving Creek heirs; and that when the suit was brought they were entitled to the possession thereof but were being kept out of possession by the defendants who were then in possession under some claim of ownership. The defendants, answering, denied the plaintiffs' title and alleged that the title to Gertrude Grayson's half interest had upon her death descended to her grandmother, from whom the defendants derived title by mesne conveyances; that they and those through whom they claimed had been in adverse possession of the lands from the year 1906; and that the plaintiffs' cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations of seven years. The plaintiffs, replying, denied these allegations.\n The case was tried by the court without a jury, which was waived. The court held that upon the death of Gertrude Grayson her undivided half interest had descended \n\n[279 U.S. 300, 302]\n\u00a0\n to her surviving Creek kindred under section 6 of the Supplemental Creek Agreement, ratified and confirmed by the Act of June 30, 1902, c. 1323; 2 found that the evidence failed to show an adverse possession in the defendants and their predecessors prior to November 17, 1907, and that neither the defendants nor those under whom they claimed 'took any possession whatever of said land until some time in 1912'; and adjudged that-with certain exceptions not here material-the plaintiffs were the owners of the undivided half interest in suit.\n On an appeal the Supreme Court of Oklahoma filed in 1922 an opinion to the effect that the plaintiffs' action was barred by the statute of limitations; but, later, on a petition for rehearing, in 1923 withdrew the original opinion and substituted another opinion holding, without reference to the statute of limitations, that under the Supplemental Creek Agreement the undivided half interest of Gertrude Grayson had been inherited by her maternal grandmother; and accordingly reversed the judgment of the trial court, with instructions to enter judgment quieting the title of the defendants. 90 Okl. 147, 216 P. 446.\n On a writ of certiorari this Court, holding that under the Supplemental Creek Agreement the undivided half interest of Gertrude Grayson had been inherited by her Creek kindred and not by her grandmother, without passing on the question of the statute of limitations, which as we stated was not then open to our consideration, reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion. Grayson v. Harris, \n267 \nU.S. 352\n, 45 S. Ct. 317.\n Thereafter the Supreme Court of Oklahoma readopted the withdrawn opinion of 1922 on the question of the statute of limitations, and ordered it filed as the opinion \n\n[279 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n of the court, 129 Okl. 285, 264 P. 627; and holding, as therein set out that the plaintiffs' action was barred under section 4471 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas-which, as a part of chapter 97 relating to limitations, had been extended over and put in force in the Indian Territory by section 31 of the Act of May 2, 1890, c. 1823-again entered judgment reversing the judgment of the trial court and remanding the cause with instructions to confirm the defendants' title. 129 Okl. 281, 264 P. 623.

Therefore its construction and effect present federal questions that are to be determined by this Court in the exercise of its own independent judgment.\n This section provides-subject to a saving clause in favor of minors, married women and persons non compos mentis-that: 'No person or persons, or their heirs, shall have, sue or maintain any action or suit, either in law or equity, for any lands, tenements or hereditaments but within seven years next after his, her or their right to commence, have or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen or accrued; and all suits, either in law or equity, for the recovery of any lands, tenements or hereditaments shall be had and sued within seven years next after title or cause of action accrued, and no time after said seven years shall have passed.'\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma-without referring to the finding of the trial court that the defendants and those through whom they claimed had not taken any \n\n[279 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n possession of the land until some time in 1912-held that, although section 4471 provided that a suit for the recovery of land should be brought within seven years 'after title or cause of action accrued,' it might be read by leaving out the words 'or cause of action,' that is, as if it provided that the suit should be brought within seven years after the title accrued; that the title of Gertrude Grayson accrued on July 9, 1906, when she acquired her title by inheritance; that the statute then commenced to run, and, as this was before Oklahoma was admitted as a State, remained the controlling statute: that under its provisions, neither Gertrude Grayson nor her heirs could sue or maintain any action for the recovery of the lands except within seven years after her title so accrued, that is, within seven years after July 9, 1906; and that, as the suit was not brought until August, 1917, eleven years thereafter, and the plaintiffs had not pleaded or proven any disabilities or other facts which relieved them from the operation of the statute, their action was barred.\n The construction thus placed upon section 4471 and the effect given to it as applied to the facts in this case, are in our judgment erroneous. The first clause requires a suit for land to be brought within seven years after the 'right to commence, have or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen or accrued.' Under the entire section it is clear that the statute does not begin to run until the plaintiff's cause of action accrues, even although his title had been previously acquired. While under some circumstances there may be a cause of action when the title is acquired, as where the land is then adversely held-obviously the mere acquisition of title cannot of itself give the owner of land a cause of action against persons who have not asserted an adverse claim under circumstances constituting an invasion of his justiciable rights. A different construction of the statute would lead to the anomalous result that an owner of land whose title appeared to be \n\n[279 U.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n unquestioned would be prevented from recovering it if he did not bring suit within seven years after he acquired title against persons who during such seven years had neither asserted any claim to the land nor held adverse possession of it nor otherwise invaded his rights; that is, that his suit would be barred before any cause of action had accrued on which he could have brought suit. This, manifestly, was not intended.\n Here it does not appear that the defendants or their predecessors had asserted any claim to the undivided one-half interest before taking possession of it in 1912. Upon the facts found by the trial court-which were not questioned by the Supreme Court-the plaintiffs' cause of action against the defendants did not accrue until that time. And as the suit was brought within less than seven years thereafter it was not barred by the statute of limitations.\n We find no decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas that gives to section 4471 the construction placed upon it by the Oklahoma court. And, on the contrary, it was said by this Court in Joines v. Patterson, supra, at page 553 of 274 U. S. (47 S. Ct. 709) that: 'Under the settled construction given to the seven-year statute of limitations by the courts of Arkansas, it began to run against (the plaintiff) when (the defendant) took possession.' And see Shearman v. Irvine's Lessee, 4 Cranch, 367, 369, involving the construction of a similar Georgia statute.\n In view of our conclusion as to the construction and effect of section 4471, the controlling federal question remaining in the case, it is unnecessary to deal in detail with other contentions urged in behalf of the defendants, which, in so far as they may bear upon the federal question, are insufficient to sustain the judgment.\n The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] President's Proclamation, 35 Stat. 2160; Oklahoma v.

Appeal being the proper method, the writ of error (No. 106) will be dismissed.\n The action was brought by the state to recover taxes for the years 1901 to 1912, inclusive. Judgment against the company was rendered by the trial court for the years 1903 to 1912, no recovery being allowed for 1901 or 1902. Upon appeal the state Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. 160 Minn. 515, 200 N. W. 834. A writ of error from this court was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, resulting from an insufficient setting forth and waiver of claim of a substantial federal constitutional question. \n273 \nU.S. 658\n, 47 S. Ct. 343. Thereafter the state Supreme Court vacated its judgment, granted a reargument upon the constitutional question, and again affirmed the trial court. 174 Minn. 3, 218 N. W. 167. The present appeal is from the judgment of the court below last described.\n In Minnesota, by statute amended from time to time, but substantially in effect since 1871 (see 1 Mason's Minnesota Statutes 1927,  2246, 2247 ), a tax, measured by gross earnings, is laid upon all railway companies, in lieu of all taxes upon all of their property within the state. As a basis for computing the tax, each railway company is required to report annually its gross earnings upon business done upon its lines wholly within the state and upon \n\n[278 U.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n interstate business in the proportion which the mileage within the state bears to the entire mileage of the reilway over which such interstate business is done. The tax thus levied is a property tax based on the gross earnings fairly attributable to the property of the railway company within the state. The state Supreme Court has so held. And to the same effect see Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 452\n, 38 S. Ct. 373.\n The attack upon the statute is not that it is bad upon its face, but that, as applied to the specific facts upon which the liability of the company in the present action was sustained, it imposes a tax in respect of earnings wholly referable to certain docks in Wisconsin and a short stretch of track immediately connected therewith, and therefore results in laying a tax upon property outside the state of Minnesota. The contention is that the statute as thus construed and applied constitutes a burden upon interstate commerce, and also violates the due process of law and equal protection of the laws clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The facts follow.\n Among the lines owned and operated by the railway company, directly or through its subsidiaries, amounting in all to more than 2,000 miles within the state, is a road 107 miles in length, running from the Mesaba Iron Range in Minnesota to, and including as part thereof, the Wisconsin docks. Eighty-seven miles of the road are in Minnesota, and 20 miles, including the docks, are in Wisconsin. The principal business of the road in that of hauling ore from the mines at Mesaba to the docks. For this service the tariff provides a single charge per ton of ore transported, in which the dock service is absorbed without being separately specified. For the years in question, the railway company, in reporting the gross earnings assignable to the Minnesota part of the line as proportioned to the foregoing division of the mileage, first allocated to the docks and deducted, as compensation for dock services, amounts \n\n[278 U.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n ranging from 15 to 25 cents per ton of ore hauled. This was done upon the theory that in calculating the gross earnings the portions of the line in the two states should be considered entirely apart from the docks, and that the amounts thus allocated and deducted constituted earnings fairly attributable to the docks and the immediately connecting track alone. Taxes were computed and paid accordingly. Subsequently, the facts being disclosed, the state brought this action for additional taxes, calculated upon the amounts thus allocated and deducted.\n The constitutional contention was not pressed in the trial court. No finding pertinent to that inquiry was either asked or made. The question was raised by the answer, but waived in both courts below, and we so held. But for the action of the state Supreme Court in granting a reargument, it would not be here now. We agree with that court that it fairly cannot be found from the evidence that the mileage value of the Wisconsin part of the line, including the docks, was in fact greater than the Minnesota part of the line. The record contains some statements in respect of the cost of the docks and in respect of expenditures in road construction, but the showing is incomplete and leaves even the question of cost in large degree a subject for conjecture.\n The evidence does not show the actual use value of either the Minnesota or the Wisconsin part of the road, or their relative values. If all the facts bearing upon the matter were revealed, they well might demonstrate not only that cost, even if proved, would not be a fair measure of the use value, but that the Minnesota part of the line, mile for mile, was equal in value to that of the Wisconsin portion with the docks included. Such evidence as the record contains tends to that conclusion rather than the contrary. The road including the docks, is a unit. The charge for transportation of ore, including dock services, is a single charge. The entire ore traffic originates and \n\n[278 U.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n seems to be controlled in Minnesota, and the earnings from that source comparatively are very great, suggesting at least the probability of a special use value of the Minnesota part of the line. It is competent for the state to impose a tax upon the property of the company within the state, and for that purpose to measure the value of such property in the way here provided. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the tax under consideration, plus that already collected, exceeds 'what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property valued as part of a going concern, (or is) relatively higher than the taxes on other kinds of property.' Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 339\n, 43 S. Ct. 366, 368 (67 L. Ed. 682).\n Under these circumstances, upon principles established by numerous decisions of this court, the tax is not open to challenge as an exaction in violation of the federal Constitution.

CO.(1929)\nNo. 506\nArgued: April 17, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. Ira A. Campbell, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. J. M. R. Lyeth, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 709]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent issued a war risk insurance policy for $27,690 upon a cargo of gasoline, owned by petitioner's predecessor in interest and valued in the policy at $212,000, on board the tanker Gulflight, bound from Port Arthur, Tex., to Rouen. On the voyage the Gulflight was torpedoed and put into a port of refuge, where, in consequence of the injury to the ship, damages and expenses of a general average nature were incurred. A general average contribution of $49,088.04, the correctness of which is not questioned, was assessed against the cargo on the basis of the actual value of the cargo at destination, which was taken to be $417, 178. Petitioner made claim on the policy for indemnity of $6,411.54, the proportion of the general average contribution which the amount of the policy bore to the agreed policy value of the cargo. Respondent paid only $ 3,258.25, that portion of the indemnity claimed which the agreed policy value bore to sound value at the time of the contribution, or that portion of the general average contribution which the amount of insurance bore to sound value.\n In a suit in admiralty in the District Court for Southern New York to recover the balance claimed, that court confirmed the report of its commissioner (1927 A. M. C. 1669), and gave judgment for petitioner, which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 27 F.( 2d) 678. This court granted certiorari November 26, 1928 (\n278 \nU.S. 595\n, 49 S. Ct. 82, 73 L. Ed. -), because of a conflict of opinion between that and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co. v. Maldonado & Co. (C. C. A.) 182 F. 744, certiorari denied, \n220 \nU.S. 622\n, 31 S. Ct. 724.\n The sole question presented here is whether, in adjusting a general average loss upon cargo insurance under a valued policy, the insured is coinsurer to the extent that the sound value of the cargo at the time of contribution exceeds its agreed value, or, stated in somewhat different \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 710]\n\u00a0\n form, whether the effect of a valued policy on cargo, in limiting the liability of the insurer, is the same in the case of a general average as of a particular average loss.\n It has long been the accepted rule that in the case of a partial loss of cargo insured under a valued policy, with the valuation honestly made, the insured, in case of increase or decrease in its value, recovers that proportion of his loss which the agreed value. or so much of it as was assumed by the particular insurer, bears to the sound value. In case of an increase in value, his recovery is thus limited as though he were a coinsurer. Lewis v. Rucker, 3 Burr. 1167; Johnson v. Sheddon, 2 East, 581. See Tunno v. Edwards, 12 East, 488; Lawrence v. New York Insurance Co., 3 Johns. Cas. (N. Y.) 217, 218; Forbes v. Manufacturers' Ins. Co., 67 Mass. ( 1 Gray) 371; London Assurance v. Companhia de Moagens, \n167 \nU.S. 149, 171\n, 17 S. Ct. 785; British & Foreign Ins. Co. v. Maldonado & Co ., supra; International Navigation Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. (D. C.) 100 F. 304, 317, 318, affirmed (C. C. 108 F. 987, certiorari denied \n181 \nU.S. 623\n, 21 S. Ct. 926. So applied, the rule permits the adjustment of the premlum to an assumed certain and unchanging value of the subject of the insurance, and protects the underwriter against increases in liability because of increase in value of the cargo, as it protects the insured against diminution of his right to recover which might otherwise result from a decrease in value. It recognizes that the purpose of valuing the cargo is not to fix the maximum amount of recovery, which is accomplished by limiting the amount of the policy, but to eliminate from the risk which the insurer assumes so much of it as is consequent upon fluctuations of the market value of the cargo, whether the loss be total or partial. For under it the insurer's liability for the loss suffered can never be greater or less than if the actual value were the agreed value. \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 711]\n\u00a0\n Agreed value thus stands in the place of prime value under an open marine policy, where the insured recovers covers such part of his loss as prime value bears to sound value. See Lewis v. Rucker, supra, 3 Burr. at page 1171; Usher v. Noble, 12 East, 639, 646; Clark v. United Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 7 Mass. 365, 5 Am. Dec. 50.\n Petitioner does not question the soundness of the rule when applied to partial loss of cargo, but argues that it should not be applied to general average contribution. It is said that petitioner need not refer to sound value to compute its loss, which is already fixed by the general average adjustment, and the valuation clause estops the insurer from showing that the sound value of the cargo was greater than the agreed value and so reducing the amount of its indemnity; also that the rule to be applied to the present case should be the same as that applied to insurance on hulls, where the insured is allowed to recover in full for a partial loss up to the amount of the insurance. Finally, it is insisted that this clause of the policy should be construed as having been adopted by the parties in contemplation of the rule contended for as one established by the decisions in New York, where the policy was effected, and as settled in British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co. v. Maldonado & Co. supra.\n Liability for general average contributions is a risk insured against by the marine policy as is loss by particular average. Its amount, as is the case of a particular average loss, is dependent upon and varies with the sound value of the goods. There is nothing in the policy to suggest that the liability of the insurer is to be computed on a basis different in the one case from the other, and a clause whose general use and effect is to limit risk from fluctuation of value of the cargo insured is equally applicable in both classes of risks. Such a limitation is justified in both cases by the fact that the only assign- \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 712]\n\u00a0\n able purpose of the agreed value is to substitute a definite for an uncertain prime value, and to eliminate from the contract, in the interest of both the insured and the insurer, the fluctuation of liability which would otherwise result from a change in sound value. To allow petitioner to recover for the loss suffered in double the amount which concededly would have been its recovery, had the same loss resulted from fire, jettison, or other partial loss of cargo, would be an anomalous result, for which petitioner offers no justification in reason or in generally established principles of marine insurance law. The coinsurance principle, long and consistently applied in the case of particular average losses under both open and valued policies, gives a reasonable and equitable effect to the stipulation fixing value, consonant with principles generally applicable to marine insurance. It may be applied to general average contributions with like effect and with added consistency and harmony in the law.\n The application of the agreed value to the adjustment of the insurance loss does not depend on estoppel as was suggested in British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co. v. Maldonado & Co., supra. The policy agreement valuing the cargo at a specified amount is not a representation, or so regarded. It is no more than a stipulation in effect, that for purposes of computation of the insurance liability the cargo shall be taken at an agreed value. Within this limitation the policy is still a policy of indemnity and the insured must prove the sound value of the cargo in order to ascertain his actual loss, by deducting from it the amount of the proceeds of the damaged cargo. In every particular average adjustment the insurer may rely on the sound value of the cargo in order to establish the extent to which the insured is a coinsurer. It is true that a general average contribution is always determined and stated in terms of money and so the insured may \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 713]\n\u00a0\n establish his loss merely by proof of its amount, but his contribution is itself based upon sound value which entered into its computation, and its amount for all practical purposes, as in the case of particular average is increased in proportion to the excess of sound value over agreed value, see S. S. Balmoral Co. v. Marten (1902) App. Cas. 511, 514, 515. We perceive no reason why his recovery may not likewise be reduced accordingly.\n The rule that the insured may recover in full for partial losses under hull insurance (International Navigation Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra; International Navigation Co. v. Sea Insurance Co. (C. C. A.) 129 F. 13; Providence & S. S. S. Co. v. Phoenix Insurance Co., 89 N. Y. 559; contra, Clark v. United Fire & Marine Insurance Co., supra; cf. Brewer v. American Ins. Co., 123 Mass. 78) does not, we think, militate against the coinsurance rule as applied to cargo insurance, or afford support for that for which petitioner contends. We need not determine whether the rule as to hull insurance may be regarded as that of this court or of others, or pass upon its merits. The distinction between insurance on cargo and that on hulls is an old one, and a different result in the case of the latter may for that reason be accepted without affecting the rule as to the former. Where the distinction has been regarded as established, the departure from the rule applied in case of particular average losses of cargo has been justified on the ground that damage to a hull is not customarily ascertained by its sale, as is the case with cargo. The usual practice in cases of partial loss is for the insured to make repairs. His repair bill represents a sum of money which is the amount of his damage, ascertained without regard to the ship's value, and so the rule has been adopted as more convenient in practice than one requiring determination of the sound value of the ship. See Lohre v. Aitchison, L. R. 2 Q. B. D. 501, 507. Some \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 714]\n\u00a0\n point is given to this explanation by the ruling in Pitman v. Universal Marine Insurance Co., L. R. 9 Q. B. D. 192, that the same rule should be applied as in particular average loss of cargoes, where the repairs were not in fact made and the loss was established by a sale of the ship. And in a case of general average contribution by the hull, the House of Lords, in S. S. Balmoral Co. v. Marten, supra, held the insured to be a coinsurer, thus applying the rule accepted in the case of partial cargo losses, and implicitly supporting the coinsurance rule applied below to general average contribution by cargo.\n It is said that this rule would result in a recovery by the insured of more than the amount of his contribution, in event of a decrease in the value of the cargo below the agreed value. The court below seems to have thought that this might be so. But no court has so held. The insured, in the case of partial loss of cargo whose sound value is less than the agreed, may recover more than his actual loss, since in computing the indemnity the cargo must be taken at the agreed value. But, where there is in fact no loss of the cargo, it is not entirely clear upon what theory the insured could increase his recovery beyond his contribution in general average by any recourse to the agreed value. Having the cargo intact, no matter what its value, it may well be that the insured must needs be content with the discharge of the general average lien upon it.\n While an appellate court may hesitate to set aside a rule of commercial law long and generally accepted and applied, such is not the case with the suggestion that general average contributions must stand on a different footing from particular average losses under a valued policy on cargo. That has been thought to be the effect of an early New York case, Strong v. New York Fireman Insurance Co., 11 Johns. (N. Y.) 323, in which counsel for the in \n\n[279 U.S. 708, 715]\n\u00a0\n surer argued against any such distinction. But the court seems to have considered that the only question before it was whether a general average adjustment made in a foreign port was enforceable against the insurer even though made under rules different from those in force in the home port. Diligent efforts at the trial of the present case to prove a custom failed. The commissioner's finding that no settled custom or usage was proved is not challenged here. He found that underwriters, the Strong Case notwithstanding, did not usually pay general average contributions in full when sound value exceeded agreed value; that, after the decision in the Maldonado Case, refusals to pay on the basis of full contribution were less frequent, but some underwriters, including respondent, continued to settle on that basis, and the failure to bring the issue before a court for adjudication was due to the fact that the amounts involved were too small to justify litigation.\n The Massachusetts courts have followed the rule applied below. Clark v. Universal F. & M. Insurance Co., supra. Cf. Brewer v. American Ins. Co., supra. The other American cases have dealt with insurance on hulls and so are not decisive. The fact that the coinsurance rule has been applied to general average contributions in England, both by judicial decision, see S. S. Balmoral Co. v. Marten, supra, and by statute, Marine Insurance Act 1906,  73, and that such is conceded to be the rule by law or custom in France, Germany, Holland, and Japan, is of weight in making a choice of two conflicting rules applicable to sea-borne commerce. We conclude that the rule applied below is the more consonant with principle and the more consistent with other accepted doctrines of marine insurance, and that the judgment below should accordingly be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARBISON v.

Angstman, both of Helena, Mont., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A Montana statute (sections 2382 and 2383, Revised Codes 1921, as amended by chapter 186,  1, 2, Laws 1925) levies an excise tax upon distributors and dealers engaged within the state in the business of refining, manufacturing, producing, or compounding gasoline or distillate and selling the same in the state, and also upon those engaged within the state in the business of shipping, transporting, or importing any gasoline or distillate into the state and selling the same in the state after it has been brought to rest therein. The basis of the tax is the sale of gasoline or distillate, and the statute, in that respect, makes no discrimination, except that it properly excludes from the operation of the tax the imported commodity while it continues subject to the commerce clause of the Constitution. Raley & Bros. v. Richardson, \n264 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 44 S. Ct. 256. Thus far the validity of the statute is conceded.\n But the contention is that the statute discriminates against the Montana refiner because it is not extended \n\n[278 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n to include gasoline or distillate shipped from other states and consumed or used after it has come to rest in Montana and its status in interstate commerce has ended. Upon this ground the statute is challenged as constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of Montana upheld the statute as valid, 81 Mont. 423, 263 P. 687, following its earlier decision in State v. Silver Bow Refining Co., 78 Mont. 1, 19, 252 P. 301, where it was held that, while a tax upon the sale of imported oil after it had come to rest in the state or upon such oil as property would be valid, any attempt to lay a tax upon products shipped into the state for consumption only would be a burden upon interstate commerce.\n This holding, as it was applied to the contention in the present case, seems to have been the result of a too literal reading of Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S. Ct. 643, which was cited as authority. In that case, this court, upon a full review of the earlier cases, held that, when a commodity shipped from another state had come to rest as a part of the stock in trade of the dealer, the interstate transportation was at an end, and, whether in the original packages or not, a state tax upon the commodity, either as property or upon its sale in the state, if laid on the commodity generally without regard to its origin, would not constitute a burden upon or be a regulation of interstate commerce, of which the commodity had been the subject. But there is nothing in the opinion to suggest that the taxing power of the state is limited to the two kinds of taxes mentioned. Interstate transportation having ended, the taxing power of the state in respect of the commodity which was the subject of such transportation, may, so far as the commerce clause of the federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) is concerned, be exerted in any way which the state's Constitution and laws permit, provided, of \n\n[278 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n course, it does not discriminate against the commodity because of its origin in another state. That under such circumstances a tax may be imposed upon the use as well as upon the sale of the commodity in domestic trade, without coming into conflict with the commerce clause, was specifically determined in Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 648\n, 41 S. Ct. 606\n\n\n But, because the state Legislature could have laid a tax upon the use of the commodity as well as upon its sale, it by no means follows that a failure to do so constituted a discrimination forbidden by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That cause does not prohibit classification, and the power of the state to classify for purposes of taxation is of wide range and flexibility, provided that the classification rest upon a substantial difference, so that all persons similarly circumstanced will be treated alike. Statutes which tax one class of property while exempting another class necessarily result in imposing a greater burden upon the property taxed than would be the case if the omitted property were included. But such statutes do not create an inequality in the constitutional sense. Nor is the imposition of an excise tax upon one occupation or one activity from which other and different occupations or activities are exempt, a denial of equal protection. It is enough if all in the same class are included and treated alike. These propositions are so firmly established by repeated decisions of this court that further discussion is unnecessary.

Ct. 526.\n The difference between an excise tax based on sales and one based on use of property is obvious and substantial. If the state sees fit to tax one and not the other, there is nothing in the federal Constitution to prevent; and it is not for this court to question the wisdom or expediency of the action taken, or to overturn the tax upon the ground that to include both would have resulted in a more equitable distribution of the burdens of taxation.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELSON v. COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY(1929)\nNo. 296\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James G. Wheeler, of Paducah, Ky., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James M. Gilbert, of Frankfort, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the Commonwealth of Kentucky against plaintiffs in error to recover an amount levied under  1, c. 120, Acts 1924,1 which imposes a tax of three cents per gallon on all gasoline sold within the commonwealth at wholesale. The words 'sold 'at wholesale,\" as used in the act, are defined to include 'any and all sales made for the purpose of resale or distribution or for use,' and also to include any person who \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n shall purchase such gasoline without the state 'and sell or distribute or use the same within the state.' The tax was increased from three cents to five cents a gallon by section 1, c. 169, Acts 1926, and part of the amount sued for was computed at the latter rate.\n Plaintiffs in error are engaged in operating a ferryboat on the Ohio river between Kentucky and Illinois. They do an exclusively interstate business. They are citizens and residents of Illinois. Their office and place of business and the situs of all their personal property is in that state. The motive power of the boat is created by the use of gasoline, all of which is purchased and delivered to plaintiffs in error in Illinois. It is stipulated that 75 per cent. of this gasoline was actually consumed within the limits of Kentucky, but all of it in the making of interstate journeys. The tax in question was computed and imposed upon the use of the gasoline thus consumed.\n The trial court rendered judgment for the commonwealth, which was affirmed by the state court of appeals. Metropolis Ferry Co. v. Commonwealth, 225 Ky. 45, 7 S.W.(2d) 506. The validity of the statute as applied by the state courts was assailed upon the grounds: (1) That it violated the provisions of the state Constitution requiring that taxes should be uniform upon all property of the same class; and (2) that it was in controvention of the commerce clause and other provisions of the federal Constitution. The state court of appeals held that the tax was not a property tax, but an excise, and, therefore, the uniformity clause of the state Constitution was not involved. The claim under the commerce clause of the federal Constitution was denied on the ground that the tax was confined to gasoline used within the limits of the state and the commerce clause was not affected. It is with the latter question only that we are here concerned.\n Regulation of interstate and foreign commerce is a matter committed exclusively to the control of Congress, and the rule is settled by innumerable decisions of this \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n court, unnecessary to be cited that a state law which directly burdens such commerce by taxation or otherwise constitutes a regulation beyond the power of the state under the Constitution. It is likewise settled that transportation by ferry from one state to another is interstate commerce and immune from the interfence of such state legislation. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 217\n, 5 S. Ct. 826; Mayor of Vidalia v. McNeely, \n274 \nU.S. 676, 680\n, 47 S. Ct. 758. The power vested in Congress to regulate commerce embraces within its control all the instrumentalities by which that commerce may be carried on. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, 114 U. S. page 204, 5 S. Ct. 826. A state cannot 'lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form, whether by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of that commerce, or on the receipts derived from that transportation, or on the occupation or business of carrying it on.' Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 648\n, 8 S. s. Ct. 1380, 1384 (32 L. Ed. 311); Lyng v. Michigan, \n135 \nU.S. 161, 166\n, 10 S. Ct. 725; Ozark Pipe Line v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555, 562\n, 45 S. Ct. 184. While a state has power to tax property having a situs within its limits, whether employed in interstate commerce or not, it cannot interfere with interstate commerce through the imposition of a tax which is, in effect, a tax for the privilege of transacting such commerce. Adams Express Company v. Ohio, \n166 \nU.S. 185, 218\n, 17 S. Ct. 604.\n The following are a few of the cases illustrating the many applications of these principles.\n A state statute imposing a tax upon freight, taken up within the state and carried out of it, or taken up without the state and brought within it, was held, in the case of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, to constitute a regulation of interstate commerce in conflict with the Constitution. The court said (15 Wall. 275, 276):\n'Then, why is not a tax upon freight transported from state to state a regulation of interstate transportation, and, therefore, a regulation of commerce among the \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n states? Is it not prescribing a rule for the transporter, by which he is to be controlled in bringing the subjects of commerce into the state, and in taking them out? The present case is the best possible illustration. The Legislature of Pennsylvania has in effect declared that every ton of freight taken up within the state and carried out, or taken up in other states and brought within her limits, shall pay a specified tax. The payment of that tax is a condition upon which is made dependent the prosecution of this branch of commerce. And as there is no limit to the rate of taxation she may impose, if she can tax at all, it is obvious the condition may be made so oneous that an interchange of commodities with other states would be rendered impossible. The same power that may impose a tax of two cents per ton upon coal carried out of the state may impose one of five dollars. Such an imposition, whether large or small, is in restraint of the privilege or right to have the subjects of commerce pass freely from one state to another without being obstructed by the intervention of state lines.'\n\n A state or state municipality is without power to impose a tax upon persons for selling or seeking to sell the goods of a nonresident within the state prior to their introduction therein, Stockard v. Morgan, \n185 \nU.S. 27\n, 22 S. Ct. 576; or for securing or seeking to secure the transportation of freight or passengers in interstate or foreign commerce, McCall v. California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S. Ct. 881; Texas Transp. Co. v. New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S. Ct. 242, 34 A. L. R. 907. Nor can a state impose a tax on alien passengers coming by vessels from foreign countries. New York v. Compagnie Gen. Transatlantique, \n107 \nU.S. 59\n, 2 S. Ct. 87. And see Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283. In Minot v. Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co., 2 Abb. U. S. 323, 343, 17 Fed. Cas. 458, 464, No. 9,645, it was held that a state law imposing a tax for the use within the state of locomotives, passenger and freight cars, and for the use of rolling stock generally, was a license fee exacted for the privilege of such \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n use. It appearing that larger portion of the locomotives, etc., was used for the interstate transportation of persons and property, the court held that the statute constituted a regulation of such commerce. In the course of the opinion, by Mr. Justice Strong, it is said:\n'It is of national importance that in regard to such subjects there should be but one regulating power, for if one state can directly tax persons and property passing through it, or indirectly, by taxing the use of means of transportation, every other may; thus commercial intercourse between states remote from each other may be destroyed.'\n\n To the same effect is a decision by Mr. Justice Matthews, in respect of a similar state statute imposing a tax for the running or using of sleeping cars within the state in the transportation of interstate passengers. Pullman Southern Car Co. v. Nolan (C. C.) 22 F. 276, 280, 281. On error to this court, the decision was affirmed and the tax condemned as one laid on the right of transit between states. Sub nom. Pickard v. Pullman Southern Car Co., \n117 \nU.S. 34, 46\n, 6 S. Ct. 635. To impose a tax upon the transit of passengers from foreign countries or between states is to regulate commerce and is beyond state power. The doctrine of Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, so far as it is to the contrary, has not been followed. Head Money Cases, \n112 U.S. 580\n, 591-594, 5 S. Ct. 247; Henderson v. New York, \n92 U.S. 259\n, 270; Pickard v. Pullman Southern Car Co., supra, \n117 U.S. 48\n (6 S. Ct. 635). The stamp tax on bills of lading for the transportation of gold and silver from within the state to points outside, which was held invalid (inadvertently on the ground that it was a tax on exports) in Almy v. California, 24 How. 169, was characterized in Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 138, as 'a regulation of commerce, a tax imposed upon the transportation of goods from one state to another, over the high seas, in conflict with that freedom of transit of goods and persons between one state \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n and another, which is within the rule laid down in Crandall v. Nevada, and with the authority of Congress to regulate commerce among the states.'\n The statute here assailed clearly comes within the principle of these and numerous other decisions of like character which might be added. The tax is exacted as the price of the privilege of using an instrumentality of interstate commerce. It reasonably cannot be distinguished from a tax for using a locomotive or a car employed in such commerce. A tax laid upon the use of the ferryboat would present an exact parallel. And is not the fuel consumed in propelling the boat an instrumentality of commerce no less than the boat itself? A tax which falls directly upon the use of one of the means by which commerce is carried on directly burdens that commerce. If a tax cannot be laid by a state upon the interstate transportation of the subjects of commerce, as this Court definitely has held, it is little more than repetition to say that such a tax cannot be laid upon the use of a medium by which such transportation is effected. 'All restraints by exactions in the form to taxes upon such transportation, or upon acts necessary to its completion, are so many invasions of the exclusive power of Congress to regulate that portion of commerce between the States.' Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n114 U.S. 214\n (5 S. Ct. 833).\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n\n Concurring opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n In view of earlier decisions of the court, I acquiesce in the result. But I cannot yield assent to the reasoning by which the present forbidden tax on the use of property in interstate commerce is distinguished from a permissible \n\n[279 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n tax on property, measured by its use or use value in interstate commerce. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 456\n, 38 S. Ct. 373; Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S. Ct. 1122; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 220\n, 17 S. Ct. 305; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Missouri, \n190 \nU.S. 412, 422\n, 23 S. Ct. 730; cf. Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S. Ct. 876. Nor can I find any practical justification for this distinction or for an interpretation of the commerce clause which would relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their fair share of the expense of government of the states in which they operate by exempting them from the payment of a tax of general application, which is neither aimed at nor discriminates against interstate commerce. It 'affects commerce among the states and impedes the transit of persons and property from one state to another just in the same way, and in no other, that taxation of any kind necessarily increases the expenses attendant upon the use or possession of the thing taxed.' Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 232 (21 L. Ed. 888).\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ...

Van Winkle and Willis S. Moore, both of Salem, Or., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arose under Insurance Law of Oregon. 2 Oregon Laws, Tit. 36 ,  6322 to 6604. Sec. 6388 of this Law provides, inter alia, as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n 'It shall be unlawful for any fire insurance company doing business in the state of Oregon to write, place or cause to be written or placed, any policy or contract for indemnity or insurance on property situated or located in the state of Oregon, except through or by the duly authorized agent or agents of such insurance company residing and doing business in this state, to whom the premium on such insurance shall be paid; ...'\n\n\n[280 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n (4) 'Every insurance company licensed to transact a fire insurance business in this state and lawfully doing such business therein, may, in respect thereof, establish agencies in this state, to consist of but one agent for each city, town or village in the state ... and additional agencies as hereinafter provided, and the name of every agent appointed, in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be filed with the insurance commissioner immediately upon the making of such appointment by any such company. The insurance commissioner shall thereupon issue to each such agent ... qualified as provided in this act a certificate setting forth that such agent is entitled to act for the company appointing him for the balance of the current year. ... The fee fixed for issuing such certificate shall be $2 and shall be paid to the insurance commissioner; ...'\n\n\n (7)\n 'Any such insurance company ... may appoint one additional agent ... in any city of this state having a population of fifty thousand or more inhabitants according to the last federal census ; ...'\n\n\n (8)\n 'Any such insurance company may appoint an additional agent or agents ... in any city of this state on application to the insurance commissioner and the payment of an annual license fee of five hundred dollars for each such agent.'\n Herbring, a resident and practising attorney in the city of Portland, Oregon, in good standing, applied to Lee, the Insurance Commissioner of Oregon, for an agent's license to represent the Northwestern National Insurance Company of Milwaukee-a foreign corporation duly qualified to write policies of fire insurance in Oregon, and already having two agents in Portland. The application-upon which the Company had indorsed its approval-was accompanied by Herbring's check for $2 as payment for a license fee. The Commissioner returned \n\n[280 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n this application to the Company, stating that he could not accept an application direct from Herbring and requesting that the Company make the application. The Company itself thereupon executed an application for a license to Herbring to represent it as agent in Portland, and sent this to the Commissioner, but without the payment of any fee or any offer of such payment. The Commissioner returned this application to the Company, stating that as it already had two agents in Portland, its request for an additional license to Herbring could not be granted unless it wished to pay the additional fee of $500 prescribed by the Oregon law. On the same day the Commissioner returned Herbring's check and advised him that his application had been returned to the Company as he would make a third agency for the Company in Portland, 'and this is not permissible under the Oregon Insurance Laws, unless the additional fee of $500 is paid for such license.'\n The Company, so far as appears, neither replied to the Commissioner, nor paid or tendered the $500 fee, nor questioned the validity of this requirement. Herbring, however, appealed to the Circuit Court of the county from the decision of the Commissioner refusing to issue to him a license as an agent for the Company. See  6335. The Company was not a party to this appeal. The court-which heard the matter without pleadings- finding that the Company's application for the appointment of Herbring to act as an additional agent was denied by the Commissioner for the reason that it refused to pay the license fee of $500 required by subd. 8 of  6388 to be paid by any insurance company appointing an additional agent, and that this provision is 'void and unconstitutional and an unlawful interference with the right of said agent to engage in the business of selling fire insurance in the State of Oregon and with the right of said \n\n[280 U.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n insurance company to appoint such agent, except upon the payment of said additional license fee,' ordered the Commissioner to issue a license to Herbring to act as agent for the Company in Portland, without requiring the Company to pay $500 as a license fee for such appointment.\n On an appeal by the Commissioner from this order, the Supreme Court of Oregon held that the payment of the $500 fee is required by  6388 'as a condition precedent to the right of any fire insurance company to appoint such additional agent;' that, 'a foreign corporation being required to comply with the statute, in order to be entitled to appoint agents and consummate its business in the state of Oregon, it follows ... that in order for an agent to obtain a license to represent such a foreign corporation there must first be a compliance by the foreign corporation with the requirements of our state law,' and that 'the rights of one applying for a license to act as agent for such insurance company are contingent upon the compliance of the company with conditions precedent to its right to appoint such an agent;' and, further, that subd. 8 of  6388 is not repugnant to either the privileges or immunities clause or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendmant, but is a valid legislative requirement of a foreign insurance company in the conduct of its business in Oregon. The judgment of the Circuit Court was accordingly reversed, and the proceeding dismissed. 126 Or. 588, 269 P. 236, 238, 60 A. L. R. 1165\n\n\n From this judgment Herbring was allowed an appeal to this Court. The only Federal question presented by his assignments of error is that the Supreme Court of Oregon 'erred in holding that Sud-div. 8 of Section 6388 of the Oregon Laws does not abridge the rights of the appellant Karl Herbring, guaranteed by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.' \n\n[280 U.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n 1. In support of this assignment the appellant takes the position that the obtaining of an agent's license, while a condition precedent to the right of the agent to do business, has no bearing whatever upon the rights and privileges of the corporation, and that the statute 'is an unreasonable and unwarrantable interference with the right of the individual to carry on a legitimate business, and class legislation in that it is an attempt to monopolize the insurance agency business,' and 'in reality not a corporate regulation, but an unconstitutional attempt to deprive the individual of his common law right to follow an inherently lawful occupation.'\n This position is not well taken. Sudb. 8 of  6388, as appears upon its face and from the entire context, is not directed against individual insurance agents and imposes no restrictions upon them, but is, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, a provision requiring the insurance company itself to pay a $500 fee as a condition precedent to its right to appoint an additional agent to represent it in any city. To exercise this right, as indicated by the statute, it must apply to the Insurance Commissioner and pay the additional license fee for such agent. It is plainly no interference whatever with the right of the individual to carry on the business of an insurance agent, or class legislation in this respect. It is obvious that, as pointed out by the Supreme Court of Oregon, in order that an agent may be licensed to represent a company there must first be a compliance by the company with the requirement of the statute; the right of one applying for a license to act as an agent for the company being contingent upon such compliance. No one has the right to receive a license to represent a company as its agent, when the company itself has no right to appoint him. And the contention that the statute is an unconstitutional interference with the individual \n\n[280 U.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n rights of Herbring himself in conducting the business of an insurance agent, is without merit.\n\n 2. \nThe appellant also urges in argument, that 'if the statute be regarded as a corporate regulation, rather than as an individual prohibition, it is unconstitutional, in that it is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious' and cannot be sustained under the police power of the State. In other words, he seeks in argument to challenge the validity of the statute on the ground that it is an infringement of the Company's constitutional right to appoint an additional agent. The Company itself is not here insisting that the statute constitutes an impairment of its own right; it raised no such question before the Commissioner, and for aught that appears acquiesced in that officer's view of the validity of the statute.\n It may well be that under the facts in this case Herbring's individual interest in this question is not direct but merely collateral and remote and not such as would have entitled him to challenge the constitutional validity of the statute on the ground that it is an impairment of the Company's own rights. But, however that may be, there is no assignment of error here which challenges the validity of the statute on that ground; and the question which Herbring seeks to raise in argument, is not before us for decision.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHIGHLAND v. RUSSELL CAR & SNOWPLOW CO.(1929)\n\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ira Jewell Williams, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. M. Liveright, of Clearfield, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued respondent in the court of common pleas of Clearfield county, Pennsylvania, to recover a balance of $830.80 alleged to be due on account of coal sold between October 17, 1917, and February 15, 1918\n\n\n The complaint shows the following facts: October 2, 1917, plaintiff wrote defendant that he had purchased the output of certain mines and offered coal at $3.60 per ton. Defendant answered that it wanted a carload per week until further notice. Plaintiff replied that he had entered defendant's order for that amount. November 14, after plaintiff had shipped some of the coal, he wrote defendant that, owing to a recent wage agreement made between the miners and operators, the cost of mining had been increased 45 cents per ton; that plaintiff was obliged to pay the additional cost to the producer; and that he was making a price until further notice of $4.05 per ton. He added: 'Unless I hear from you to the contrary I shall take if for granted that you wish me to continue shipments on your order at this new price.' The amount sued for was based on $3.60 per ton for coal shipped in October and $4.05 per ton for that delivered later. Defendant had paid $1,531.84.\n The affidavit of defense admitted the sale and delivery of the coal, denied any agreement as to price, and, among \n\n[279 U.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n other averments not here material, alleged that the United States had fixed the prices of the coal and that its value on that basis was $1,322. 74.\n The trial court held that the plaintiff was bound by the prices fixed by the government, and, notwithstanding a verdict for the plaintiff, gave defendant judgment, which was affirmed by the Superior Court and also in the Supreme Court of the state.\n The prices so held applicable were fixed by the President pursuant to section 25 of the Lever Act approved August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276, 284. An executive order of August 21 specified $2 per ton on board cars at the mine; and an order made October 27 added 45 cents per ton.\n Plaintiff here insists, as he maintained in the state courts, that Congress had no power to establish or to authorize the President to prescribe prices for coal without providing just compensation for those who, in the absence of such regulation, might have sold their coal for more. And he contends that, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the act and orders operate to deprive him of liberty of contract. His coal was not requisitioned for public use. He does not claim that the amount paid by defendant was not compensatory or that it did not give him a reasonable profit or that the value of the coal was greater than the prices fixed by the President. The sole question is whether plaintiff's constitutional rights were infringed by the enforcement of the act and orders to prevent him from selling his coal for prices in excess of the just compensation he would have been entitled to receive if it had been taken under the sovereign power of eminent domain.\n Long before this country became involved in the war, Congress adopted measures for the national defense, and promptly after it entered the conflict there were developed \n\n[279 U.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n comprehensive plans for immediate and effective use of military force. An Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, authorized the enlargement, equipment, and training of the army. An Act of August 29 following, 39 Stat. 619, 645 ( 10 USCA  1361), empowered the President in time of war to take and utilize systems of transportation for the movement of troops, war material and other purposes, and, December 26, 1917, the President did take over the railroads of the country. 40 Stat. 1733. The Joint Resolution of April 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 1, declaring war with Germany, directed the President to employ the entire naval and military forces and pledged all the resources of the country to bring the conflict to a successful termination. An Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182, authorized the President extensively to exert the power of eminent domain in aid of construction and acquisition of ships.\n The Lever Act was broader than its predecessors. It was passed to encourage production, conserve supply, and control distribution of foods, fuel, and many other things deemed necessary to carry on the war. Hoarding, waste, and manipulations for the enhancement of prices were condemned. The President was empowered to license and regulate production, prices and sales, to requisition coal and other necessaries, to purchase and sell wheat, flour, and other staple articles of food, and to take over and operate factories and mines. Section 25 empowered the President to fix the price of coal, to regulate distribution among dealers and consumers, domestic or foreign, and to require producers to sell only to the United States through a designated agency empowered to regulate resale prices. The basis prescribed for the determination of prices to be charged by producers of coal was the cost of production, including the expense of operation, maintenance, depreciation, and depletion, plus a just and reasonable profit. And prices to be charged by dealers were \n\n[279 U.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n to be made by adding to their cost a just and reasonable sum for profit. The act did not require producers or dealers to sell their coal. It provided for the ascertainment and contemplated the payment of just compensation for all property that it authorized the President to take.\n During 1916 and the early months of 1917, the mining and distribution of coal had been greatly disturbed by conditions resulting from the war abroad and the preparations for national defense being made in this country. There was panic among consumers, and, in order to secure adequate supply, they offered prices higher than any theretofore prevailing. The prices of coal for immediate delivery which previously had been from $1.50 to $2, were bid up to $5, $6, and in exceptional cases as high as $7.50 per ton. In April contracts for the year's delivery could be made only at prices ranging from $3 up to $5 or $6 per ton. In May of that year the Council of National Defense created a committee to deal with the situation. After prolonged negotiation with producers throughout the country an agreement was reached by which a tentative maximum price was fixed at $3 per ton at the mines, to which was added 25 cents for selling commission to wholesalers. The purpose was to fix a price high enough to stimulate production so that by the operation of the law of supply and demand fair and just prices would result. Final Report of United States Fuel Administrator, p. 20; Report of Engineers Committee, 1918, 1919, p. 1.\n But this arrangement having failed to give assurance of an adequate supply, Congress and the President found it necessary to take the steps here involved. Defendant was engaged in manufacturing snowplows for railroads. Unquestionably, the production of such equipment was in the state of war then prevailing a public use for which coal and other private property might have been taken by exertion of the power of eminent domain. When regard \n\n[279 U.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n is had to the condition of the coal industry, plaintiff's control of the product of the mines referred to in his letters and the tone of his price quotations support the view that, in the interest of national safety, there was need of regulation in order to prevent manipulations to enhance prices by those having coal for sale and to lessen apprehension on the part of consumers in respect of their supply and the prices liable to be exacted.\n It is everywhere recognized that the freedom of the people to enter into and carry out contracts in respect of their property and private affairs is a matter of great public concern and that such liberty may not lightly be impaired.

Childrens Hospital, supra, \n261 \nU.S. 544\n, 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238. The principal purpose of the Lever Act was to enable the President to provide food, fuel, and other things necessary to prosecute the war without exposing the government to unreasonable exactions. The authorization of the President to prescribe prices and also to requisition mines and their output made it manifest that, if adequate supplies of coal at just prices could not be obtained by negotiation and price regulation, expropriation would follow. Plaintiff was free to keep his coal, but it would have been liable to seizure by the government. The fixing of just prices was calculated to serve the convenience of producers and dealers, as well as of consumers of coal needed to carry on the war. As it does not appear that plaintiff would have been entitled to more if his coal had been requisitioned, the act and orders will be deemed to have deprived his only of the right or opportunity by negotiation to obtain more than his coal was worth. Such an exaction would have increased the cost of the snowplows and other railroad equipment being manufactured by the defendant and therefore would have been directly opposed to the interest of the government. As applied to the coal in question, the statute and executive orders were not so clearly unreasonable and arbitrary as to require them to be held repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOBBS v. POLLOCK(1929)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Egan and William R. Smith, both of Topeka, Kan., and John F. Rhodes, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert J. Folonie, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus directing Judge Pollock, of the District Court of the United States for the District of Kansas, to call to his assistance two other Judges under  266 of the Judicial Code as amended (U. S. Code, Title 28,  380 (28 USCA  380)), to determine the prayer for interlocutory and final injunctions against the petitioners in certain suits. An order to show cause was issued and the Judge has made a return. We are of opinion that the writ must be denied upon the incontrovertible portions of the return, and therefore need to consider nothing else.\n One hundred and fifty stock fire insurance companies doing business in Kansas have bills in equity, of which the bill considered in this case is a type, pending in the District Court of the United States for the District of Kansas. These bills allege diversity of citizenship and also that the defendant Commissioner of Insurance, one of the present petitioners, has made an order affecting the rates to be charged for the issue of policies of fire insurance that is confiscatory and contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, but that if not obeyed he will enforce by revoking the plaintiffs' licenses to do business in Kansas. The bills also allege that the statutes of Kansas as construed to authorize the order are unconstitutional like it and for the same reason. The bills pray for a restraining order ad interim, an interlocutory injunction after a hearing before three Judges, and a permanent injunction by final decree.\n On April 3, 1928, the parties appeared before the present respondent, and on his suggestion the defendants, the present petitioners, agreed to take no action that \n\n[280 U.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n would be subject to restraint by a temporary restraining order, without first giving notice of intention to do so in ample time for the plaintiff to resort to the Court. An order embodying the agreement and stating that the Court therefore refrained from entering any temporary restraining order was entered at that date, and remained in force for over a year. Shortly after the entry the petitioners presented to the Judge a motion to dismiss the suit, on the ground that the matter was res judicata by reason of certain proceedings in the State Court, and also for want of equity, which after argument was overruled. On May 10, 1929, the case was referred to a Master to make findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the issues in the case. This was upon motion of the plaintiff made on May 4. On May 6 the defendants, the petitioners, notified the plaintiff that they would proceed to enforce the rate order on and after May 20, 1929, and on May 7 filed a motion for a hearing before three Judges, on the plaintiff's application for an interlocutory injunction. This came up on May 10 along with the plaintiff's motion to refer to a Master. The plaintiff 'definitely stated that it did not intend to press its prayer contained in its bill of complaint;' meaning thereby its prayer for an interlocutory injunction based upon the asserted unconstitutionality of the Statute and rate orders, and the Judge said that the defendants' motion did not pertain to any matter before the Court, and intimated that he was ready to grant a restraining order. A few days later the plaintiff moved for an interlocutory injunction against the cancellation of the licenses of the plaintiff and its agents. The defendants objected and asked the Judge to call in two others. This the Judge declined to do and issued an order restraining the defendants from canceling licenses because of supposed violations of the rate order in question. The defendants treat this as satisfying the prayers of the bill and requiring three Judges to be within the jurisdiction of the Court to grant. \n\n[280 U.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n The Judge knows at least what he intended and supposed himself to do. He states that it appeared to him that the only question before him was the construction of the ratemaking statute of Kansas, the plaintiff conceding its constitutionality for the purposes of the motion. He construed the act as not warranting a revocation of licenses for violation of the rate order or for anything that the plaintiff appeared to have done, and says that the injunction granted by him was not granted upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute but restrained only something that by his construction the statute did not allow. We see no reason why the injunction should be held to go further than the Judge says that he intended it to go, or than its express words, or why those words should not be explained as a construction of the statute rather than an adjudication that it is void. But if the injunction is taken as we say that it should be, it is not within Judicial Code  266 as amended (28 USCA  380), three Judges were not necessary, and the petitioners have no right to come here. Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, 46 S. Ct. 557. Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n272 \nU.S. 317\n, 47 S. Ct. 105. Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 385. On the other hand as there was jurisdiction of the cases by reason of diversity of citizenship, as well as on the constitutional ground, an appeal lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals if the petitioner thought the Judge's construction wrong. The Judge was clearly right in treating the plaintiffs in the several cases as masters to decide what they would ask and in danying to the defendants, the petitioners, the power to force upon the plaintiffs a constitutional issue which at that moment they did not care to raise. The fact that the bills raised it did not prevent them from presenting a narrower claim and contenting themselves with the granting of that. Other serious difficulties in the way of the petition are set up in the return, but we think that the foregoing answer makes further argument unnecessary.\n Rule to show cause discharged.\n Mandamus denied. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL SHOE CO. v. PINKUS(1929)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. D. Williamson, of St. Louis, Mo., and O. C. Burnside and W. G. Streett, both of Lake Village, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Lamar Williamson, of Monticello, Ark., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On an action in the common pleas court of Chicot county, Arkansas, August 24, 1925, plaintiff in error obtained judgment against Pinkus for $ 463.43. The debtor was an insolvent merchant doing business in that county. He had 46 creditors; his debts amounted to more than $10,000, and his assets were less than $3,000. On the day judgment was entered, the insolvent, invoking chapter 93 of Crawford & Moses' Digest, commenced a suit in the chancery court of that county, praying to be adjudged insolvent and for the appointment of a receiver to take and distribute his property as directed by that statute. \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n On the same day, the court adjudged him insolvent and appointed a receiver, with directions to take the property and liquidate it and direct creditors to make proof of their claims 'with the necessary stipulation that they will participate in the proceeds in full satisfaction of their demands.' And, in pursuance of the statute, the court ordered the receiver, after the expiration of 90 days, first to pay costs, next salaries earned within 90 days, then 'the claims of those who have duly filed their claims with the above stipulation, if enough funds are in your hands to pay the same, and lastly ... to pay any and all other claims of creditors, or so much as the funds ... will pay, all creditors of the same class receiving an equal percentage of the funds.' The receiver sold the property for $2,659, and gave Pinkus $500 as his exemption. The court allowed $250 as compensation for the receiver.\n November 18, 1925, plaintiff in error caused execution to issue for collection of the judgment. The sheriff, being unable to find property on which to levy, returned the writ unsatisfied. Thereupon plaintiff in error brought this suit. The complaint alleged the facts aforesaid, asserted that chapter 93 had been superseded and suspended by the passage of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA), and prayed that the judgment be paid out of the funds in the hands of the receiver. The chancery court overruled the contention, held that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, and dismissed the case. Its judgment was affirmed by the highest court of the state. 173 Ark. 316, 292 S. W. 996. The case is here under section 237(a), Judicial Code (28 USCA  344(a).\n The question is whether, in the absence of proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, what was done in the chancery court protects the property in the hands of the receiver from seizure to pay the judgment held by plaintiff in error.\n A state is without power to make or enforce any law governing bankruptcies that impairs the obligation of \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n contracts or extends to persons or property outside its jurisdiction or conflicts with the national bankruptcy laws.

The Supreme Court of the state treats it as such. Hickman v. Parlin-Orendorff Co., 88 Ark. 519, 115 S. W. 371; Baxter County Bank v. Copeland, 114 Ark. 316, 322, 169 S. W. 1180; Morgan v.

It provides for surrender by insolvent of all his unexempt property (section 5885) to be liquidated by a trustee for the payment of debts under the direction of the court. It classifies creditors, prescribes the order of payment of their claims and gives preference to those fully discharging the debtor in consideration of pro rata distribution (section 5888). Mayer v. Hellman, \n91 U.S. 496\n, 502; Stellwagen v. Clum, supra; Segnitz v. Garden City Co., 107 Wis. 171, 83 N. W. 327, 50 L. R. A. 327, 81 Am. St. Rep. 830; In re Weedman Stave Co . (D. C.) 199 F. 948, and cases cited.\n The state enactment operates within the field occupied by the Bankruptcy Act. The insolvency of Pinkus was covered by its provisions. He could have filed a voluntary petition. His application to the state court for the appointment of a receiver was an act of bankruptcy, section 3(a), U. S. C. tit. 11,  21(a); 11 USCA  21(a); and, at any time within four months thereafter, three or more creditors having claims amounting to $500 or over could have filed an involuntary petition, section 59(b), U. S. C. tit. 11,  95(b); 11 USCA  95(b). We accept the statement made in the brief submitted on hehalf of Pinkus that he had been discharged in voluntary proceedings within six years prior to the filing of the petition in the chancery court. Therefore he could \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n not have obtained discharge under Bankruptcy Act,  14, U. S. C. tit. 11,  32 (11 USCA  32), and, in proceedings under that act, all his creditors would have been entitled to participate in distribution without releasing the insolvent as to unpaid balances.\n The power of Congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States is unrestricted and paramount. Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 4. The purpose to exclude state action for the discharge of insolvent debtors may be manifested without specific declaration to that end; that which is clearly implied is of equal force as that which is expressed. New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 150, et seq., 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; Erie R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 170\n, 37 S. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S. Ct. 175. The general rule is that an intention wholly to exclude state action will not be implied unless, when fairly interpreted, an act of Congress is plainly in conflict with state regulation of the same subject. Savage v. Jones, supra; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S. Ct. 170; Merchants Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365\n, 39 S. Ct. 114. In respect of bankruptcies the intention of Congress is plain. The national purpose to establish uniformity necessarily excludes state regulation. It is apparent, without comparison in detail of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act with those of the Arkansas statute, that intolerable inconsistencies and confusion would result if that insolvency law be given effect while the national act is in force. Congress did not intend to give insolvent debtors seeking discharge, or their creditors seeking to collect claims, choice between the relief provided by the Bankruptcy Act and that specified in state insolvency laws. States may not pass or enforce laws to interfere with or complement the Bankruptcy Act or to provide additional or auxiliary regulations. Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617, 618; Northern Pacific Railway v. Washington, \n222 U.S. 370\n, 378, et seq., 32 S. Ct. 160; \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis, Iron Mt. & S. Ry. v.

R. Co. v. Winfield, supra; Oregon- Washington Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87, 101\n, 46 S. Ct. 279.\n It is clear that the provisions of the Arkansas law governing the distribution of property of insolvents for the payment of their debts and providing for their discharge or that otherwise relate to the subject of bankruptcies are within the field entered by Congress when it passed the Bankruptcy Act, and therefore such provisions must be held to have been superseded. In Boese v. King, \n108 \nU.S. 379, 385\n, 2 S. Ct. 765, 769 (27 L. Ed. 760), this court, referring to the effect of the national act upon a state insolvency law similar to the Arkansas statute under consideration, said: 'Undoubtedly the local statute was, from the date of the passage of the Bankruptcy Act, inoperative in so far as it provided for the discharge of the debtor from future liability to creditors who came in under the assignment and claimed to participate in the distribution of the proceeds of the assigned property.' And see Foley-Bean Lumber Co. v. Sawyer, 76 Minn. 118, 78 N. W. 1038; Parmenter Manufacturing Co. v. Hamilton, 172 Mass. 178, 51 N. E. 529, 70 Am. St. Rep. 258; In re Bruss-Ritter Co. (D. C .) 90 F. 651.\n In the opinion of the state Supreme Court, it is said that the effect of the proceedings in the chancery court was the same as if the insolvent had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. But the property was not handed over simply for the purpose of the payment of debts as far as it would go; it was transferred pursuant to a statute and decree imposing conditions intended to secure the debtor's discharge. As its claim was less than $500, plaintiff in error could not invoke the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court without co-operation of other creditors. It was shown by insolvent's petition that his property was less than one-third of his debts. The amount remaining \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n after deducting his exemption and the costs was not sufficient to pay 20 per cent. of the claims. All creditors except plaintiff in error agreed fully to release insolvent in consideration of the distribution directed by the decree. And, as their claims were much in excess of the fund, plaintiff in error could have obtained nothing on account of its claim without giving insolvent a full release.\n The decision below is not supported by Boese v. King, supra. In that case there was an assignment under the New Jersey insolvency law. Some years later creditors obtained judgment against the assignor in New York. A receiver appointed in supplementary proceedings sued the assignees in New York to compel payment of the judgment out of funds they had on deposit there. The highest court of the state denied relief, and the case was brought here on writ of error. This court held that the assignment was sufficient to pass title; and, as the Bankruptcy Act had superseded the New Jersey insolvency law, all the creditors were entitled unconditionally to share in pro rata distribution. The receiver was held not entitled to recover because the judgment creditors could have secured equal distribution by the institution of bankruptcy proceedings, but instead they waited until after the expiration of the time allowed for that purpose, and then by the New York suit sought to obtain preference and full payment. In the course of the opinion, it is said at page 386 of 108 U. S. (2 S. Ct. 770): 'It can hardly be that the court is obliged to lend its aid to those who, neglecting or refusing to avail themselves of the provisions of the act of Congress, seek to accomplish ends inconsistent with that equality among creditors which those provisions were designed to secure.'\n The case now before us is essentially different. Plaintiff in error could not invoke jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. The insolvent commenced proceedings under the Arkansas insolvency law on the day that judgment was \n\n[278 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n obtained against him. His purpose was to delay plaintiff in error and to secure full releases as provided by the statute. The state court did not treat the proceedings under the state law as a transfer of insolvent's property for unconditional distribution as was done in Boese v. King. On the contrary, the decree was the same as if the Bankruptcy Act had not been passed, and the court held that, without giving any effect to the statute, the insolvent by what was done in the chancery court could compel the same distribution and obtain for himself the same advantages as were contemplated by the insolvency law. We are of opinion that the proceedings in the chancery court cannot be given that effect. The enforcement of state insolvency systems, whether held to be in pursuance of statutory provisions or otherwise, would necessarily conflict with the national purpose to have uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.\n As all the proceedings were had under the Arkansas insolvency law, we need not decide whether, independently of statute, an assignment for the benefit of creditors on the conditions specified in the decree would protect the property of the insolvent from seizure to pay the judgment. And, as the passage of the Bankruptcy Act superseded the state law, at least in so far as it relates to the distribution of property and releases to be given, plaintiff in error is entitled to have its judgment paid out of the fund in the hands of the receiver.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice SANFORD are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL SHOE CO. v.

For the purpose of ascertaining the tax, every corporation subject to it is 'deemed to have employed' within the state 'that proportion of its entire ( outstanding) capital stock and surplus that its property and assets in this state bears to all its property and assets wherever located.'\n The Stock Corporation Act of the Missouri Laws of 1921, p. 661, first provided for the formation and regulation of corporations with stock of no par value. By section 12 of that act it was enacted that, for the purpose of ascertaining any organization taxes imposed by the laws of the state, computed on the basis of the par value of shares of stock, each share of stock without nominal or par value should be considered the equivalent of a share having a par value of $100. In State of Missouri v. Pierce Petroleum Corporation, 2 S.W. (2d) 790, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that this section supplemented and amended the earlier provisions of the franchise tax law of the state by prescribing the method of computing the tax, imposed by section 9836, in the case of corporations having nonpar stock. \n\n[279 U.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n The tax was thus fixed in effect at the rate of not less than 5 cents on each share of nonpar stock employed within the state, regardless of its actual value.\n Appellant is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling shoes in both in trastate and interstate commerce. It has gross assets of more than $97,000,000, of which 54 per cent. are located in Missouri. It has 100,000 shares of preferred stock, of the par value of $100, and 3,760, 000 shares of nonpar stock, for which latter it received $9.60 per share. The total paid in capital was thus $46,082,631.09. Appellant alleges that, prior to the enactment of section 12, its nonpar stock was assessed on the basis of the amount paid for it. Cf. State v. Freehold Investment Co., 305 Mo. 88, 103, 264 S. W. 702. But, applying the statute as interpreted by the state court in State v. Pierce Petroleum Corp., supra, the taxing authorities have assigned to appellant's outstanding nonpar stock a value of $376,000,000, resulting in an increase of appellant's annual franchise tax from approximately $25,000 to a sum in excess of $100,000. $The market value of appellant's stock does not appear and no foundation is laid for assailing the tax as so excessive as to be a denial of due process, but appellant argues, as did respondent in No. 601, New York v. Latrobe, supra, that the tax is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. For reasons, stated more at length in our opinion in that case, we conclude that the present statute does not infringe that clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although it directs that the tax be ascertained by assigning a specific value to the nonpar stock, and applying to it the rate applicable to par value stock, the resultant inequalities do not differ from those complained of in that case where the tax was computed at a flat rate on nonpar stock, used in the state, without assigning to it any value.\n The assignment to the shares of a value in excess of their present worth or of the present value of the assets \n\n[279 U.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n within the state does not operate to tax property or business without the state. The tax is a privilege and not a property tax. Giving to the shares a specified value by which the tax is measured, only affects the rate of tax on the privilege and does not give the statute an extraterritorial effect. The result is the same as if a flat tax of 5 cents per share upon that part of the capital which is justly apportioned to the state had been imposed. So apportioned the tax cannot be said to reach the property or the franchise of the corporation without the state.\n Other objections to the tax require but brief comment. The mere fact that a corporation is engaged in interstate commerce does not relieve it of local tax burdens in respect of its property within the state or its intrastate business. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 696\n, 15 S. Ct. 360. Appellant does a substantial amount of local commerce. A franchise tax imposed on a corporation, foreign or domestic, for the privilege of doing a local business, if apportioned to business done or property owned within the state, is not invalid under the commerce clause merely because a part of the property or capital included in computing the tax is used by it in interstate commerce.

The tax is distinguishable from those considered in Air-Way Electric Appliance Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71\n, 45 S. Ct. 12, Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S.

Ed. -, which either \n\n[279 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n were measured by authorized, instead of issued, capital stock, or were not limited to the part of the capital stock justly apportioned to the taxing state.\n It is urged, also, that the Stock Corporation Act of 1921 violates section 28 of article 4 of the Missouri Constitution, which provides that 'no bill ... shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.' The title of the act in terms described it as authorizing corporations to make provision '... for the issue of either or both preferred or common shares without nominal or par value; regulating the same and such corporations; and prescribing the method of determining the number of shares and capital of corporations issuing shares in such manner.'\n It is said that, as section 12 operates, by reference to the Franchise Tax Law, to change the tax on corporations having nonpar stock, it is in effect a taxing act, and hence its title does not clearly express the subject of the legislation. But its subject was the method of ascertaining the value of nonpar shares for taxation and other statutory purposes, a subject-matter clearly embraced in the title which described the legislation as 'regulating' corporations having nonpar stock and as 'prescribing the method of determining ... the capital of corporations' issuing such shares. The purpose of the constitutional provision is 'to prevent the inclusion of incongruous and unrelated matters in the same measure and to guard against inadvertence, stealth, and fraud in legislation.' See Posados v. Warner, Barnes & Co. (No. 251, October Term, 1928, April 22, 1929) \n279 \nU.S. 340\n, 49 S. Ct. 333, 73 L. Ed. -, Dickason v. County Court, 128 Mo. 427, 441, 30 S. W. 103, 31 S. W. 23. And it is only necessary that the title indicate the subject so as to give notice of the general character of the legislation without entering into minute details. Dickason v. County Court, supra, at page 441 (30 S. W. 105); Garesche v. Roach, 258 Mo. 541, 560, 167 S. W. 1008; Cocoa Cola Bottling Co. v. Mosby, 289 Mo. 462, 472, 233 S. W. 446; Barrett v. Imhof, 291 Mo. 603, 619, 238 S. W. 122; State v. Mullinix, 301 Mo. 385, 389, 257 S. W. 121; State ex rel. Missouri \n\n[279 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n Pacific R. R. Co. v. Danuser (Mo. Sup.) 6 S.W.(2d) 907. The title of the present act satisfies these requirements. One having but slight familiarity with earlier Missouri legislation would have known that upon the enactment of legislation dealing with corporations having a nonpar stock, some method of assigning a value to such stock might appropriately be adopted in order to adapt and subject the new type of corporation to existing legislation. This purpose was plainly and sufficiently anticipated in the title of the present act. It was not necessary that the title should go further and indicate the earlier laws which were thus made applicable to the new type of corporation.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks the effect of the statute is to tax property beyond the state. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v. UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 54\nArgued: October 28, 1929Decided: November 25, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D.

C. C. 421, I. C. C. 489, for the purpose of determining whether the Commission shall order the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, the Southern Pacific Company, and the Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad Company to build and use an interstate union passenger station in the city of Los Angeles, Cal.; and after consideration of the evidence, to make such order therein as the facts may require. The Supreme Court of the District dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals reversed its judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings. 34 F.(2d) 228. This court granted a writ of certiorari.\n The Railroad Commission of that state had in 1921 (19 Opinion of the R. R. Com. of Cal. pp. 740, 937) ordered the carriers to file plans, etc., and to acquire sufficient land within what is known as the Plaza area in that city for a union \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 61]\n\u00a0\n passenger station and terminal, to submit plans therefor, and, upon their approval of them by that Commission, to proceed with the construction of the station. The carriers carried these orders by writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State, and that court, in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, 190 Cal. 214, 244 P. 460, held that by the Transportation Act of 1920 Congress had taken exclusive authority over the matter of a union interstate terminal depot, and the court therefore denied the State Railroad Commission the jurisdiction which it had sought to exercise. The State Railroad Commission petitioned this court for writs of certiorari and at the same time instituted proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission which resulted in the orders above referred to.\n This court granted a writ of certiorari and on April 7, 1924, rendered its decision in Railroad Commission of California v. Southern Pacific Co. et al., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376, wherein, in affirming the judgment of the state court, we held that the relocation of tracks, which were incidental to the proposed union passenger station, required a certificate of approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission under paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 1, Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 402, Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 476-478 (49 USCA  1 )), as a condition precedent to the validity of any action by the carriers or of any order by the State Railroad Commission, and that until the Interstate Commerce Commission had acted under those paragraphs, the carriers could not be required to provide a new union station or to extend their main tracks thereto as ordered by the State Railroad Commission.\n Pending the hearing of the causes in \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376, the direct proceeding, referred to above, was instituted before the Interstate Commerce Commission by the city of Los Angeles, asking for an order by the Commission requiring the three railroads to build a new union station at the \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 62]\n\u00a0\n Plaza site. With it were consolidated an application by the Southern Pacific Company for authority to abandon certain main line tracks and the operation of passenger and freight train service on Alameda street, and an application by the Southern Pacific and the Salt Lake for authority to construct new, and to extend existing, lines.\n The Commission held, 100 I. C. C. 421, that it was without authority to require the construction of the new union station. It said in the report, at page 430: 'We conclude that we are not empowered to require the construction of a union passenger station as sought in No. 14778. To make the record clear, we repeat that no question of discrimination or preference is presented here; and that under the issue framed in the complaint in No. 14778 we will give no consideration to matters shown of record for the purpose of determining whether we should issue an order requiring the construction and use of a union station by any of the defendants.'\n The Commission, in order to facilitate dispatch in the disposition of the case, although it held that it had no power to require the building of an interstate commerce passenger station, made hypothetical certificates which could be summarized as follows: (1) That the public convenience and necessity require the extensions of lines that may be necessary to reach and serve any union passenger station within the plaza which may be constructed in accordance with a lawful order of the State Commission and that may be necessary to provide for the incidental nearrangement of passenger and freight routes, and that the expense involved will not impair the carriers' ability to perform their duties to the public. (2) That public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment of train service on Alameda street and such other abandonments of lines as would be necessary in connection with the establishment of any such station, so lawfully ordered by the State Commission. \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 63]\n\u00a0\n The report further found that such joint use of track or other terminal facilities as may be incidental and necessary to the proper operation of any such union station is in the public interest and is practicable, without substantially impairing the owning carriers' ability to handle own business. As to the application by the Southern Pacific and Salt Lake to extend their lines to permit the joint use of the Southern Pacific's existing station, the Commission's findings were unfavorable and its order denied the application. The Commission's then report was not accompanied by certificates carrying out its findings, and it reserved jurisdiction to alter its findings in the event that the plan of the State Commission, as finally evolved, should be materially different from that 'as here considered to be in the public interest.'\n After a further hearing in the direct proceeding instituted by Los Angeles for an order directing the erection of a union station the prayer of Los Angeles was denied. 142 I. C. C. 489. Thereafter the city filed the petition above referred to in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus. This was in the present proceeding.\n Attached to the petition as exhibits were the pertinent parts of the record in the previous cases. There were filed an answer of the Commission, and a demurrer to the answer. The Commission still adhered to its original report. The Supreme Court of the District entered a judgment overruling the demurrer and, the city electing to stand upon the petition, dismissed the petition. On an appeal, the judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District, which held, in substance, that the Commission was vested with supervisory control over the three carriers and that they were subject to an order requiring the construction of the union station and the necessary connecting tracks prayed for. \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 64]\n\u00a0\n The sole question for decision is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction to order the construction of the union station. This issue arises on provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456. These are paragraphs 18 to 22 added to section 1 of the original act (49 USCA  1), and paragraphs 3 and 4 of section 3 (49 USCA  3).\n These paragraphs and sections of the Transportation Act of 1920 may be shortly stated as follows:\n Paragraph 18 forbids the construction of a new line of railroad, or the acquisition or operation of any line of railroad or extension thereof in interstate commerce, unless there shall have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present and future convenience and necessity require or will require the construction or operation of additional or extended line of railroad and forbids any interstate carrier to abandon all or any portion of its line, unless there shall have been obtained from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity.\n Paragraph 19 requires notice and hearings in any proceeding to secure such certificate.\n Section 20 gives the Commission discretionary power to issue such certificates and provides for an injunction at the suit of the United States for any construction, operation, or abandonment of such line of railroad or extension thereof without a certificate, and punishes a violation.\n Section 21 provides that after a hearing in such proceeding upon complaint, or upon its own initiative without complaint, the Commission may authorize of require by order any carrier by railroad subject to the act to provide itself with safe and adequate facilities for performing as a common carrier its car service, as that term is used in the act, and to extend its line or lines, if the Commission finds that it is reasonably required in the interest of pub- \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 65]\n\u00a0\n lic convenience and necessity, and will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public.\n Section 3, embracing paragraphs 3 and 4, provides, in paragraph 3, that carriers shall afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of passengers of property to and from their several lines and those connecting therewith and forbids discrimination.\n Paragraph 4 provides that if the Commission finds that to do so will not substantially impair the ability of a carrier owning and entitled to the enjoyment of terminal facilities to handle its own business, it may require the use of any such terminal facilities of any carrier, including main-line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminal, by another carrier or other carriers, on such terms and for such compensation as the carriers affected may agree upon, or, in the event of a failure to agree, as the Commission may deem just and reasonable for the use so required, as if in condemnation proceedings.\n In its final report the Interstate Commerce Commission held that it had no power to require the construction and operation of a union station upon the site specified. The Commission's report was in part as follows:\n'Complainants have again raised the question whether we have power to require the defendants to construct and operate a union passenger station upon the site heretofore specified in our findings. Their contention that we have such power was pressed with vigor upon the original submission before us. The complainants point to section 3, paragraph 3 and 4 of the interstate commerce act as furnishing the necessary statutory authority. As stated in the original report, at page 430, we concluded that we are not empowered to require the construction \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 66]\n\u00a0\n of a union passenger station as sought in No. 14778, under the issues framed in the complaint therein. ... In Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Jackson & Eastern Ry. Co., \n271 U.S. 244\n, 250 (46 S. Ct. 535) the Supreme Court said:\n\n\"In matters relating to the construction, equipment, adaptation and use of interstate railroad lines, with the exceptions specifically set-forth in paragraph 22, Congress has vested in the Commission the authority to find the facts and thereon to exercise the necessary judgment. The Commission's power under paragraph 3 of Sec. 3 to require the establishment of connections between the main lines of carriers were asserted by it in Pittsburgh & W. V. R. R. Co. v. Lake Erie, A. & W. R. Co., 81 I. C. C. 333, a case decided after the withdrawal by the Jackson & Eastern of its application to the Commission for leave to make the junction at Curran's Crossing, and in Chamber of Commerce v. Wichita Falls, R. & Ft. W. R. Co., 109 I. C. C. 81. That its jurisdiction is exclusive was held in People ex rel. New York C. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 233 N. Y. 113, 119- 121 (135 N. E. 195). Compare Lake Erie, A. & W. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 109 Ohio St. 103 (141 N. E. 847).\"\n\n The Commission proceeded:\n'The distinction between a simple switch connection such as was contemplated by the cases previously referred to, and the elaborate facilities sought to be required by us in the present case, is obvious. Re-examination of the whole subject again leads us to the conclusion that under existing law we are not empowered to require the construction of a union passenger station of the character sought by the complaint. ...\n\n'All issues of fact having been considered and concluded by our original report and by this report on further hearing, nothing remains for us but to deny the application of the city of Los Angeles and the intervener, the \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 67]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Commission of the State of California, for a final order herein requiring the construction of a station as found in the public interest. ...'\n\n In weighing the effect of the Transportation Act, it should be noted that in this important measure affecting associations between interstate carriers of a compulsory character, there is nowhere express authority for the establishment of union passenger stations compulsory or otherwise. Emphasis is put on physical connection between the tracks of one carrier and others if permitted by the Interstate Commerce Commission and if properly paid for, either by agreement or condemnation, by the carrier enjoying the use of the track of the other companies. But it is limited in extent to connections with the terminals of other companies within a reasonable length. This court said: The possible peril to interstate commerce in a physical connection between two main tracks 'shows that the jurisdiction of the Commission over such connections must be exclusive, if the duty imposed upon it to develop and control an adequate system of interstate rail transportation is to be effectively performed. Moreover, the establishment of junctions between the main lines of independent carriers is commonly connected with the establishment of through routes and the interchange of car services, and is often but a step toward the joint use of tracks.' Alabama Railway v. Jackson Railway, \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 535, 537.\n The description in the Alabama Railway Case, \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 535, is that of a physical connection between railroads engaged in interstate commerce, but it contains no suggestion that the junction is to include union passenger stations.\n There are cases in the state courts in which by virtue of statutory provision railroads are required expressly to unite in a passenger station, if determined by commis- \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 68]\n\u00a0\n sioners appointed by the court or by a Railroad Commission. Mayor and Aldermen of Worcester v. Norwich and Worcester Ry. Co., 109 Mass. 103, 113; Railroad Commission of Alabama v. Alabama Northern Ry. Co., 182 Ala. 357, 62 So. 749; Railroad Commission of Alabama v. Alabama Great Southern Ry. Co., 185 Ala. 354, 362, 64 So. 13, L. R. A. 1915D, 98; Missouri, O. & G. Ry. Co. v. State, 29 Okl. 640, 119 P. 117; Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. State, 90 Okl. 173, 217 P. 147; State v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. ( Tex. Civ. App.) 165 S. W. 491, 199 S. W. 829, 930. But there is no Federal case in which is built up out of such words as those which we find in the Transportation Act of 1920 authority for requiring such a station.\n Without more specific and express legislative direction than is found in the act, we cannot reasonably ascribe to Congress a purpose to compel the interstate carriers here to build a union passenger station in a city of the size and extent and the great business requirements of Los Angeles. The Commission was created by Congress. If it was to be clothed with the power to require railroads to abandon their existing stations and terminal tracks in a city and to combine for the purpose of establishing in lieu thereof a new union station, at a new site, that power we should expect to find in congressional legislation. Such authority, if conferred in Los Angeles, would have application to all interstate railroad junctions, including the numerous large cities of the county , with their residential, commercial, shopping, and municipal centers now fixed and established with relation to existing terminals. It would become a statute of the widest effect and would enter into the welfare of every part of the country. Various interests would be vitally affected by the substitution of a union station for the present terminals. A selection of its site from the standpoint of a city might greatly affect property values and likewise local transportation systems. The exercise of such power would compel the \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 69]\n\u00a0\n carriers to abandon existing terminals, to acquire new land and rights of way and enter upon new construction, to abandon large tracts, and to sell territory of the same extent as no longer necessary for the use of the carriers.\n There would have to be tribunals to apportion the expenditures and cost as between the carriers. A proper statute would seem to require detailed directions, and we should expect the intention to be manifested in plain terms and not to have been left to be implied from varied regulatory provisions of uncertain scope. It would be a monumental work and one requiring the most extensive exercise of expert engineering and railroad construction. It would make possible great changes of much importance in the plans of every city and in the rearrangement and mutations of railroad property and public and private business structures everywhere. We find no statutory preparation for the organization of such machinery.\n We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals of the District in its disposition to view section 3, paragraph 3, as vesting the Interstate Commerce Commission 'with almost unlimited power in the matter of establishing terminals and union stations for the proper interchange of traffic between the converging interstate railroad lines.' The words 'reasonable, proper and equal facilities' are, of course, comprehensive enough to include not only trackage but terminal facilities described as extending a reasonable distance outside of the terminal, but hardly to give the Commission 'unlimited power' in the building of union stations.\n To attribute to Congress an intention to authorize the compulsory establishment of union passenger stations the country over, without special mention of them as such, would be most extraordinary. The general ousting from their usual terminal facilities of the great interstate car- \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 70]\n\u00a0\n riers would work a change of title and of ownership in property of a kind that would be most disturbing to the business interest of every state in the country.\n To recognize what is here sought as within the power of the Commission to order to be done in each of all the great cities throughout the United States and to sustain it as legal, without provision for effective restraint by the carriers, or other interests, would expose the community to possible abuse, with nothing but self-imposed restraint on bureaucratic extravagance.\n When the interest of a great city in its improvements is to be promoted entirely at the expense of railroads that enter it, Congress would be expected to hesitate before it would change discretionary leave for the erection of such stations into positive command. In such a case the expenditure of a large amount of capital will not bring with it corresponding increase in the railroad revenues. If Congress had intended to give an executive tribunal unfettered capacity for requisitioning investment of capital of the carriers and the purchase of lange quantities of land and material in an adverse proceeding, we may well be confident that Congress would have made its meaning far clearer and more direct than in the present meager provisions of the Transportation Act. The suggestion of complainants is that out of provisions for local union of main tracks and switching tracks we should use our imaginations and develop them into provisions for giant union passenger stations. It is true that the railway systems may be united through switches and connecting tracks in physical connection, but this has not been held to justify great monumental structures, extended in their complicated machinery and superficial extent and expense. There is a difference of real substance between such conecting tracks and switches and junctions and a passenger metropolitan union station. The latter calls into being a new \n\n[280 U.S. 52, 71]\n\u00a0\n entity naturally requiring new legislative authority. This court, referring to a kindred matter, said of this case: 'But there is great difference between such relocation of tracks or local union stations and what is proposed here. The differences are more than that of mere degree, they and their consequences are so marked as to constitute a change in kind.' \n264 \nU.S. 331, 346\n, 44 S. Ct. 376, 379.\n But it is said that we have already foreclosed the conclusion in this case by our opinion in \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376. The only issue there presented to this court was whether it was necessary to secure from the Interstate Commerce Commission its approval of the construction of a union station and the relocation of the connecting tracks proposed. The point in that case was the necessity for the acquiescence by the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to a union passenger station. We held such a certificate to be necessary before a union station or connecting lines of interstate carriers could be lawful. That is all we held.\n It is quite true that we made references in the opinion to a case foreshadowed in the hypothetical certificates of the Commission in the building of a union station. Such references had, however, not the slightest significance in respect to who could or should build the station, or whence its cost should be defrayed.

The Court of Claims denied the claim, 64 Ct. Cl. 686, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n\n[279 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n On June 15, 1921, Edwin C. Stewart died, appointing his wife and the Ithaca Trust Company executors and the Ithaca Trust Company trustee of the trusts created by his will. He gave the residue of his estate to his wife for life with authority to use from the principal any sum 'that may be necessary to suitably maintain her in as much comfort as she now enjoys.' After the death of the wife there were bequests in trust for admitted charities. The case presents two questions the first of which is whether the provision for the maintainence of the wife made the gifts to charity so uncertain that the deduction of the amount of those gifts from the gross estate under section 403(a)(3), supra, in order to ascertain the estate tax, cannot be allowed. Humes v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 487, 494\n, 48 S. Ct. 347. This we are of opinion must be answered in the negative. The principal that could be used was only so much as might be necessary to continue the comfort then enjoyed. The standard was fixed in fact and capable of being stated in definite terms of money. It was not left to the widow's discretion. The income of the estate at the death of the testator and even after debts and specific legacies had been paid was more than sufficient to maintain the widow as required. There was no uncertainty appreciably greater than the general uncertainty that attends human affairs.\n The second question is raised by the accident of the widow having died within the year granted by the statute, section 404, and regulations, for filing the return showing the deductions allowed by section 403, the value of the net estate and the tax paid or payable thereon. By section 403(a)(3) the net estate taxed is ascertained by deducting among other things gifts to charity such as were made in this case. But as those gifts were subject to the life estate of the widow of course their value was diminished by the postponement that would last while the widow \n\n[279 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n lived. The question is whether the amount of the diminution, that is, the length of the postponement, is to be determined by the event as it turned out, of the widow's death within six months, or by mortality tables showing the probabilities as they stood on the day when the testator died. The first impression is that it is absurd to resort to statistical probabilities when you know the fact. But this is due to inaccurate thinking. The estate so far as may be is settled as of the date of the testator's death. See Hooper v. Bradford, 178 Mass. 95, 97, 59 N. E. 678. The tax is on the act of the testator not on the receipt of property by the legatees. Young Men's Christian Association v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 44 S. Ct. 291; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 49\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; and passim; New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 348\n, 349 S., 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660; Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61\n, 44 S. Ct. 293. Therefore the value of the thing to be taxed must be estimated as of the time when the act is done. But the value of property at a given time depends upon the relative intensity of the social desire for it at that time, expressed in the money that it would bring in the market. See International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 222\n, 34 S. Ct. 853. Like all values, as the word is used by the law, it depends largely on more or less certain prophecies of the future, and the value is no less real at that time if later the prophecy turns out false than when it comes out true. See Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243, 247\n, 48 S. Ct. 63; City of New York v. Sage, \n239 \nU.S. 57, 61\n, 36 S. Ct. 25. Tempting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities by the now certain fact, we are of opinion that it cannot be done, but that the value of the wife's life interest must be estimated by the mortality tables. Our opinion is not changed by the necessary exceptions to the general rule specifically made by the act.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v.

Code, title 8,  203 et seq. (8 USCA  203 et seq.), which provides: 'When used in this Act the term 'immigrant' means any alien departing from any place outside the United States destined for the United States, except ... (2) an alien visiting the United States temporarily as a tourist or temporarily for business or pleasure. ...' The complete section, together with other pertinent provisions of the act, are copied in the margin. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Neither respondent is a native of Canada. Mary Cook, is a British subject, born in Scotland, who came to Canada in May, 1924, She is a spinner by occupation, and resides at Niagara Falls, Ontario. Antonio Danelon \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n is a native of Italy, who came to Canada in 1923. He also resides at Niagara Falls, Ontario. He alleges that he became a Canadian citizen by reason of his father's naturalization. Both sought admission to the United States on December 1, 1927, as nonimmigrants, under the excepting clause ( 2) above quoted. Prior thereto, Mary Cook had crossed from Canada to the United States daily for a period of three weeks to engage in work at which she was employed. On the occasion in question, she was out of employment, but desired admission to look for work. Danelon had been at work in the United States for more than a year, crossing daily by the use of an identification card. He sought admission to resume work. Both were denied admission by the immigration authorities, on the ground that they were quota immigrants within the meaning of the act, and did not come within the excepting clause. Section 3(2). The following departmental regulation, adopted under section 24 of the act (8 USCA  222) has been in force since September, 1925: 'Temporary visits ... for the purpose of performing labor for hire are not considered to be within \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n the purview of section 3(2) of the act.' It is not disputed that both aliens were property excluded if the validity of this regulation is established.\n In a habeas corpus proceeding, brought in behalf of the two aliens, the federal District Court for the Western District of New York sustained the action of the immigration officials and dismissed the writ. On apppeal, this judgment was reversed. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that an alien crossing from Canada to the United States daily to labor for hire was not an immigrant but a visitor for business within the meaning of section 3(2) of the act. U. S. on Petition of Albro, ex rel. Cook v. Karnuth, 24 F.(2d) 649. In reaching that conclusion the court seemed of opinion that, if the statute was so construed as to exclude the aliens, it would be in conflict with article 3 of the Jay Treaty of 1794, 8 Stat. 116, 117, a result, of course, to be avoided if reasonably it could be done. Lem Moon Sing v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 538, 549\n, 15 S. Ct. 967\n\n\n We granted the writ of certiorari because of the far-reaching importance of the question. The decision below affects not only aliens crossing daily from Canada to labor in the United States, but, if followed, will extend to include those entering the United States for the same purpose from all countries, including Canada, who intend to remain for any period of time embraced within the meaning of the word 'temporary.' By the immigration rules, this time is defined as a reasonable fixed period to be determined by the examining officer, which may be extended from time to time, though not to exceed one year altogether from the date of original entry. Thus, if the view of the court below prevail, it will result that aliens-not native of Canada or any other American country named in section 4(c)-whose entry as immigrants is precluded, may land as temporary visitors and remain at work, in the United States for weeks or months at a time.\n First. The pertinent provision of article 3 of the Jay Treaty follows:\n\n\n[279 U.S. 231, 236]\n\u00a0\n 'It is agreed that it shall at all times be free to his Majesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hudson's bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other . ...'\n The position of the government is that (1) there is no conflict between the treaty and the statute, but (2) in any event, the treaty provision relied on was abrogated by the War of 1812. We pass at once to a consideration of the second contention, since, if that be sustained, the first becomes immaterial and the statute open to construction unembarrassed by the treaty.\n The effect of war upon treaties is a subject in respect of which there are widely divergent opinions. The doctrine sometimes asserted, especially by the older writers, that war ipso facto annuls treaties of every kind between the warring nations, is repudiated by the great weight of modern authority; and the view now commonly accepted is that 'whether the stipulations of a treaty are annulled by war depends upon their intrinsic character.' 5 Moore's Digest of International Law,  779, p. 383. But as to precisely what treaties fall and what survive, under this designation, there is lack of accord. The authorities, as well as the practice of nations, present a great contrariety of views. The law of the subject is still in the marking, and, in attempting to formulate principles at all approaching generality, courts must proceed with a good deal of caution. But there seems to be fairly common agreement that at least the following treaty obligations remain in force: Stipulations in respect of what shall be done in a state of war; treaties of cession, boundary, and the like; \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 237]\n\u00a0\n provisions giving the right to citizens or subjects of one of the high contracting powers to continue to hold and transmit land in the territory of the other; and, generally, provisions which represent completed acts. On the other hand, treaties of amity, of alliance, and the like, having a political character, the object of which 'is to promote relations of harmony between nation and nation,' are generally regarded as belonging to the class of treaty stipulations that are absolutely annulled by war. Id., p. 385, quoting Calvo, Droit Int. (4th Ed.) IV. 65,  1931.\n In Society, etc., v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, a case involving the right of a British corporation to continue to hold lands in Vermont, this court was called upon to determine the effect of the War of 1812 upon the ninth article of the Jay Treaty which provides:\n'That British subjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his Majesty, shall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective estates and titles therein; and may grant, sell, or devise the same to whom they please, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns shall, so far as may respect the said lands and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded as aliens.' 8 Stat. 116, 122.\n\n It was held that the title to the property of the society was protected by the sixth article of the Treaty of 1783, 8 Stat. 80, 83, was confirmed by the words of article 9 above quoted, and was not affected by the War of 1812. The applicable rule was stated (8 Wheat. p. 494) in the following words:\n'But we are not inclined to admit the doctrine urged at the bar, that treaties become extinguished, ipso facto, by war between the two governments, unless they should be revived by an express or implied renewal on the return of peace. Whatever may be the latitude of doctrine laid \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 238]\n\u00a0\n down by elementary writers on the law of nations, dealing in general terms, in relation to this subject, we are satisfied, that the doctrine contended for is not universally true. There may be treaties of such a nature, as to their object and import, as that war will put an end to them; but where treaties contemplate a permanent arrangement of territorial, and other national rights, or which, in their terms, are meant to provide for the event of an intervening war, it would be against every principle of just interpretation to hold them extinguished by the event of war. If such were the law, even the treaty of 1783, so far as it fixed our limits, and acknowledged our independence, would be gone, and we should have had again to struggle for both upon original revolutionary principles. Such a construction was never asserted, and would be so monstrous as to supersede all reasoning.\n\n'We think, therefore, that treaties stipulating for permanent rights, and general arrangements, and professing to aim at perpetuity, and to deal with the case of war as well as of peace, do not cease on the occurrence of war, but are, at most, only suspended while it lasts; and unless they are waived by the parties, or new and repugnant stipulations are made, they revive in their operation at the return of peace.'\n\n The English High Court of Chancery reached the same conclusion in Sutton v. Sutton, 1 Russ. & M. 663, 675:\n'The relations, which had subsisted between Great Britain and America, when they formed one empire, led to the introduction of the ninth section of the treaty of 1794, and made it highly reasonable that the subjects of the two parts of the divided empire should, notwithstanding the separation, be protected in the mutual enjoyment of their landed property; and, the privileges of natives being reciprocally given, not only to the actual possessors of lands, but to their heirs and assigns, it is a reasonable construction that it was the intention of the treaty that \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 239]\n\u00a0\n the operation of the treaty should be permanent, and not depend upon the continuance of a state of peace.'\n\n These cases are cited by respondents and relied upon as determinative of the effect of the War of 1812 upon article 3 of the treaty. This view we are unable to accept. Article 9 and article 3 relate to fundamentally different things. Article 9 aims at perpetuity, and deals with existing rights, vested and permanent in character, in respect of which, by express provision, neither the owners nor their heirs or assigns are to be regarded as aliens. These are rights which, by their very nature, are fixed and continuing, regardless of war or peace. But the privilege accorded by article 3 is one created by the treaty, having no obligatory existence apart from that instrument, dictated by considerations of mutual trust and confidence, and resting upon the presumption that the privilege will not be exercised to unneighborly ends. It is, in no sense, a vested right. It is not permanent in its nature. It is wholly promissory and prospective, and necessarily ceases to operate in a state of war, since the passing and repassing of citizens or subjects of one sovereignty into the territory of another is inconsistent with a condition of hostility. See 7 Moore's Digest of International Law,  1135; 2 Hyde, International Law,  606. The reasons for the conclusion are obvious-among them, that otherwise the door would be open for treasonable intercourse. And it is easy to see that such freedom of intercourse also may be incompatible with conditions following the termination of the war. Disturbance of peaceful relations between countries occasioned by war is often so profound that the accompanying bitterness, distrust, and hate indefinitely survive the coming of peace. The causes, conduct, or result of the war may be such as to render a revival of the privilege inconsistent with a new or altered state of affairs. The grant of the privilege con- \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 240]\n\u00a0\n notes the existence of normal peaceful relations. When these are broken by war, it is wholly problematic whether the ensuing peace will be of such character as to justify the neighborly freedom of intercourse which prevailed before the rupture. It follows that the provision belongs to the class of treaties which does not survive war between the high contracting parties, in respect of which, we quote, as apposite, the words of a careful writer on the subject:\n'Treaties of the fifth class are necessarily at least suspended by war, many of them are necessarily annulled, and there is nothing in any of them to make them revive as a matter of course on the advent of peace-frequently in fact a change in the relations of the parties to them effected by the treaty of peace is inconsistent with a renewal of the identical stipulations. It would appear therefore to be simplest to take them to be all annulled, and to adopt the easy course, when it is wished to put them in force again without alteration, of expressly stipulating for their renewal by an article in the treaty of peace.' Hall, International Law (5th Ed.) pp. 389, 390.\n\n Westlake classifies treaties not affected by war as (1) those providing what is to be done in a state of war; (2) transitory or dispositive treaties, including such as are intended to establish a permanent condition of things, such as treaties of cession, boundary, and recognition of independence, as well as those having no conceivable connection with the causes of war or peace; and (3) treaties establishing arrangements to which third powers are parties, such as guaranties and postal and other unions. Westlake, International Law, part II, pp. 29-32. He the says:\n'Outside the exceptions which have been discussed, treaties between belligerents do not survive the outbreak of the war. At the peace there is no presumption that the parties will take the same view as before the war of their interests, political, commercial or other. It is for \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 241]\n\u00a0\n them to define on what terms they intend to close their interlude of savage life and to reenter the domain of law.'\n\n Fauchille, Traite de Droit International Public, 1921, vol. II, p. 55, says that:\n'A state of war puts an end to treaties concluded with a view to peaceful relations between the signatories and the object or end of which is to strengthen or maintain such peaceful relations, for example, treaties of alliance, subsidies, guarantees, commerce, navigation, customs union, etc. Those treaties from their very nature are subject to an implicit resolutory condition, namely a break in the state of peace. They cannot survive the outbreak of hostilities between the signatory States. War, to them, is a cause of final extinction and not of mere suspension. When peace is concluded, they do not spontaneously come out of a comatose state; they do not revive unless expressly renewed in the peace treaty.'2\n\n These expressions and others of similar import which might be added, confirm our conclusion that the provision of the Jay Treaty now under consideration was brought to an end by the War of 1812, leaving the contracting powers discharged from all obligation in respect thereto, and, in the absence of a renewal, free to deal with the matter as their views of national policy, respectively, might from time to time dictate. \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 242]\n\u00a0\n We are not unmindful of the agreement in article 28 of the Treaty 'that the first ten articles of this treaty shall be permanent, and that the subsequent articles, except the twelfth, shall be limited in their duration to twelve years.' It is quite apparent that the word 'permanent' as applied to the first ten articles was used to differentiate them from the subsequent articles-that is to say, it was not employed as a synonym for 'perpetual' or 'everlasting,' but in the sense that those articles were not limited to a specific period of time, as was the case in respect of the remaining articles. Having regard to the context, such an interpretation of the word 'permanent' is neither strained nor unusual. See Texas, etc., Railway Co. v. Marshall, \n136 \nU.S. 393, 403\n, 10 S. Ct. 846; Bassett v. Johnson, 2 N. J. Eq. 154, 162.\n It is true, as respondents assert, that citizens and subjects of the two countries continued after the War of 1812, as before, freely to pass and repass the international boundary line. And so they would have done if there never had been a treaty on the subject Until a very recent period, the policy of the United States, with certain definitely specified exceptions, had been to open its doors to all comers without regard to their allegiance. This policy sufficiently accounts for the acquiescence of the government in the continued exercise of the crossing privilege upon the part of the inhabitants of Canada, with whom we have always been upon the most friendly terms; and a presumption that such acquiescence recognized a revival of the treaty obligation cannot be indulged.\n Second. In construing section 3(2) of the Immigration Act, we are not concerned with the ordinary definition of the word 'immigrant' as one who comes for permanent residence. The act makes its own definition, which is that 'the term 'immigrant' means any alien departing from any place outside the United States destined for the United States.' The term thus includes every alien com- \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 243]\n\u00a0\n ing to this country either to reside permanently or for temporary purposes, unless he can bring himself within one of the exceptions. The only exception pertinent to the present case is the second, quoted at the beginning of this opinion, namely, an alien visiting the United States 'temporarily for business or pleasure.' The contention is that respondents were temporary visitors for business; and the case is therefore narrowed to the simple inquiry whether the word 'business,' as used in the statute, includes ordinary work for hire. The word is one of flexibility; and, when used in a statute, its meaning depends upon the context or upon the purposes of the legislation. It may be so used as either to include or exclude labor; 'for though labor may be business, it is not necessarily so, and the converse is equally true, that business is not always labor.' Bloom v. Richards, 2 Ohio St. 387, 396. The true sense in which the word was here employed will be best ascertained by considering the policy, necessity, and causes which induced the enactment. See Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold, etc., Co., \n93 U.S. 634\n, 638; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 12 S. Ct. 511; Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, 43 S. Ct. 65.\n The various acts of Congress since 1916 evince a progressive policy of restricting immigration. The history of this legislation points clearly to the conclusion that one of its great purposes was to protect American labor against the influx of foreign labor. In the report of the House Committee to accompany the bill which became the Quota Act of May 19, 1921, 42 Stat. 5 (H. of R. Report 4, 67th Cong. 1st Sess,), it was stated (page 3) that one of the causes which called for the immediate passage of an act to restrict immigration was: '2. Large unemployment in the United States, making it impracticable for the United States to accept a heavy immigration.' And further (page 7): 'In the opinion of a majority of the members of this commit- \n\n[279 U.S. 231, 244]\n\u00a0\n tee the economic aspects of immigration alone call for the passage of this restrictive legislation, if there were no other reasons.' In the Senate report upon the same bill (S. Report 17, 67th Cong. 1st Sess. p. 4) one of supposed that Congress intended, by admitting the new immigration had been of a migratory character, immigrants coming to the United States not so much for the purpose of permanent residence as to seek temporary profitable employment. The report of the House Committee to accompany the bill which afterwards became the Act of 1924, now under consideration (H. of R. Report 350, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.) likewise makes clear that protection of American labor was one of the controlling reasons for further restriction of immigration. The committee, after pointing out that various suggested plans for admitting laborers and farmers had been rejected, said (page 22): 'As has been so often said with reference to the demand for the admission of laborers, the present gain is not worth the future cost.'\n In view of this definite policy, it cannot be supposed the Congress intended, by admitting aliens temporarily for business, to permit their coming to labor for hire in competition with American workmen, whose protection it was one of the main purposes of the legislation to secure.\n The word 'business,' as here used, must be limited in application to intercourse of a commercial character; and we hold that the departmental regulation, to the effect that temporary visits for the purpose of performing labor for hire are not within the purview of section 3(2) of the act, is in accordance with the congressional intent.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 3.

MAUMEE VALLEY ELECTRIC CO.(1929)\nNo. 674\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n\n No. 674.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 797, 798]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George W. Ritter, of Toledo, Ohio, Gilbert Bettman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Le Roy W. Hunt, of Toledo, Ohio, for appellants.\n Mr. U. G. Denman, of Toledo, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal, under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), from a final decree, following an interlocutory decree, of a District Court of three judges for Southern Ohio, 33 F.(2d) 318. The decree enjoined appellants, the superintendent of public works of Ohio, a state officer, the city of Toledo, certain villages in Ohio, and the board of county commissioners of Lucas county, Ohio, from draining or otherwise interfering with the flow of water in a section of the Miami & Erie Canal in such manner as to interfere with rights of appellee to take surplus water from the canal under certain leases and a grant acquired by it or its assignors from the state. Appellee contends that the act of the Ohio Legislature of May 11, 1927, under which appellants purport to act, is in violation of the Federal Constitution.\n The section of the canal in question extends from a point on the Maumee river northeasterly along the river \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 799]\n\u00a0\n to Toledo and thence to Lake Erie. The water from the river enters this section of the canal at its western end and flows past the Providence Mills involved in No. 675, Kirk v. Providence Mill Co., \n279 \nU.S. 807\n, 49 S. Ct. 511, 73 L. Ed. -. Some 16 miles from the inlet is a side cut through which water may be discharged into the river and so diverted from the rest of the canal. The section from the inlet to this side cut is described as 'lineal part 2.' Appellee's plant is located on lineal part 1, which extends from the side cut northeasterly to the outlet at Toledo, and is thus dependent for its supply of water on a continuous flow through lineal part 2.\n The several leases were granted by the state, acting through its board of public works, in 1895, 1901, two in 1903, and 1906. Each for a specified consideration or a stipulated rental, purported to grant for a period of 30 years, with privilege of renewal, the right to take from the canal specified amounts of water for hydraulic purposes. In 1910 the lease of 1895 was supplemented and amended to provide for an increased amount of water. For present purposes, we may assume that all rights under these leases and any extension or renewal of them are vested in appellee, and that each has been from time to time properly renewed at the expiration of its term.\n The canal in question and the waters passing through it are the property of the state, and all the leases were granted under the provisions of the Act of March 23, 1840 (38 Ohio Laws, p. 87), authorizing upon specified terms, disposition for hydraulic purposes of the surplus waters of the canals of the state not required for navigation. By section 22 of that act it was provided that no right to use the waters should be disposed of 'except such as shall accrue from the surplus water of the canal ... after supplying the full quantity necessary for the purposes of navigation,' and by section 23 it was enacted that the leases should contain, as did the present leases in substance, a stipu- \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 800]\n\u00a0\n lation that the state or its authorized agents 'may at any time resume the privilege or right to the use of water, or any portion thereof, whenever it may be deemed necessary for the purpose of navigation, or whenever its use for hydraulic purposes shall be found in any manner to interfere with and injuriously affect the navigation. ...'\n Following the acquisition of its first lease in 1900, appellee constructed a small hydraulic electric plant on land adjacent to lienal part 1. In 1910, appellee, having secured three of the other leases, reconstructed its plant, and, pursuant to an agreement with the state, improved the canal at large expense, and is now using the water from it in the business of generating and selling electric light and power.\n By Act of May 11, 1927 (112 Ohio Laws, pp. 360-363; sections 14178 to 14178-12 of General Code of Ohio), it was directed that that portion of the Miami & Erie Canal known here as 'lineal part 2' be abandoned for both canal and hydraulic purposes and held by the state for the purpose of constructing a highway upon lands occupied by the canal. It transferred the abandoned part to the supervision and control of the state highway director and directed him within 60 days after the act should take effect, to drain the water from the abandoned part of the canal and to prevent water from flowing into or through that part. Section 4, provided that all leases previously granted for canal or hydraulic purposes on the part of the canal referred to 'shall become and be null and void on and after sixty days from the taking effect of this act.' Since lineal part 1, from which appellee withdraws water from the canal under its several leases, is fed only by the water flowing from lineal part 2, compliance with the statute will also result in draining the water from lineal part 1 of the canal and will drprive appellee of the use of the water which it has been withdrawing under its leases. \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 801]\n\u00a0\n Appellee asserts, as the district court held, that the effect of the act of 1927 is to impair the obligation of the contracts embodied in its leases in violation of section 10, art. 1, and to deprive it of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n By Act of January 22, 1920 (108 Ohio Laws, part 2, p. 1138), the Ohio Legislature had declared that lineal part 1 of the canal should be abandoned. By the same act, purchase of this section by the city of Toledo was authorized, subject to the rights of owners of existing leases. It was provided that if the city should deprive the lessees of 'their water privileges' the city should pay them 'a fair compensation for the loss of the water to which they are entitled'1 and the conveyance to the city should so provide. Under this statute lineal part 1 was sold and conveyed to the city. Upon the adoption of a resolution by the city council directing that the water be shut off from lineal part 1, and upon refusal of the city to pay appellee for the deprivation of its use of the water, appellee brought suit in the Western Division of the Northern District of Ohio for an injunction restraining the city from cutting off the water. A decree of that court denying an injunction was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Maumee Valley Electric Co. v. City of Toledo, 13 F.(2d) 98. That court declined to pass upon the power and right of the state to abandon the canal and cut off the water from the lessees, but held that the city had entered into a contract with the state for the benefit of appellee to permit the water to flow through the canal unless compensation was paid. The bill of complaint in the present suit sets up the contract with the city and the \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 802]\n\u00a0\n decree in the suit in the Northern District, but that decree is not before us for review. It does not appear that the city threatens to violate the decree or that there are any circumstances entitling appellee to any further relief against it upon the contract for its benefit, or that the state through its legislation and conveyance of lineal part 1 to the city of Toledo intended to surrender or has surrendered any of its rights in or powers over lineal part 2, or has subjected itself to any new or additional obligation to maintain the canal or continue the flow of water through it.\n The present suit, therefore, must turn upon the nature and extent of the right to withdraw water from the canal which appellee acquired under the grant and its several leases. To establish that its constitutional rights are infringed, it must show that compliance with the act of 1927 is inconsistent with and infringes the rights conferred upon it by them. They are public grants by the state, to be construed in the light of the statute of 1840 authorizing them, and the other laws of the state. What the state has granted it may not take away, but the exercise of powers reserved to it under the grant cannot infringe either the contract or due process clauses of the Constitution.\n The section of the canal now in question was originally constructed and operated by the state as a part of a larger canal system for purposes of navigation. By Act of February 23, 1820 (18 Ohio Laws, p. 147), commissioners were appointed to locate a canal between Lake Erie and the Ohio river. The canal was constructed under the Act of February 4, 1825 ( 23 Ohio Laws, p. 50), which created a board of canal commissioners and empowered them to construct a navigable canal, including the section presently involved, to take and use the waters of the state for that purpose, to establish reasonable tolls for the use of that canal and to provide for their collection. Provision was first made for the use of the surplus waters of the \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 803]\n\u00a0\n canal for hydraulic power by Act of February 18, 1830 (28 Ohio Laws, p. 58 ), which was superseded by the Act of March 23, 1840 (38 Ohio Laws, p. 87), under which the present leases were granted.\n The paramount object of the state in constructing the canal was to effect navigable communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio river. See State ex rel. Attorney General v. Railway Co., 37 Ohio St. 157. The use of the water for hydraulic purposes was only incidental and subordinate to the declared purpose of the state to promote navigation and was expressly made so by the Leasing Act of 1840, which limited all leases to the use of surplus water not required for purposes of navigation and provided for their abrogation whenever the use of the water for hydraulic purposes interfered with navigation. Leases of surplus water, granted under the act of 1840 and similar in terms to those involved in the present litigation, have been repeatedly construed by the highest court of the state of Ohio, which has uniformly held that they were only incidental to the use and maintenance of the canal for purposes of navigation; that they imposed no obligation on the state to maintain the canal either for navigation or other purposes and when abandoned by the state the right of lessees to surplus water ceased. Hubbard v. City of Toledo (1871) 21 Ohio St. 379; Little Miami Elevator Co. v. Cincinnati (1876) 30 Ohio St. 629; Fox v. Cincinnati (1878) 33 Ohio St. 492; Vought v. Railroad Co. (1898) 58 Ohio St. 123, 161, 50 N. E. 442. In Fox v. Cincinnati, supra, it was held that a lease of surplus waters in the Miami & Erie Canal under the act of 1840 was subject to the power of the state to abandon the locus quo for purposes of navigation and to convert it into a city highway. On writ of error, this court affirmed the judgment of the state court (\n104 U.S. 783\n, 785), saying by Chief Justice Waite:\n'The use of the water for hydraulic purposes is but an incident to the principal object for which the canal was \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 804]\n\u00a0\n built; to wit, navigation. The large expenditures of the state were to furnish, not water-power, but a navigable highway for the transportation of persons and property. The authority of the board of public works to contract in respect to power was expressly confined to such water as remained after the wants of navigation had been supplied; and it never could have been intended in this way to impose on the state an obligation to keep up the canal, no matter what the cost, for the sole purpose of meeting the requirements of its water leases. There was certainly no duty resting on the state to maintain the canal for nevigation any longer than the public necessities seem to require. When it was no longer needed, it might be abandoned; and, if abandoned, the water might be withdrawn altogether.'\n\n The court below, recognizing that such had been the established construction of surplus water leases, thought nevertheless that as at the time of appellee's first lease, 1895, navigation on the canal had very much diminished and at the time of the later leases had ceased, the state, by continuing to grant leases of surplus water under the act of 1840 must be taken to have abandoned the use of the canal for navigation and to have made use of it only as a source of water for sale for hydrauplic purposes. Hence it concluded that the leases could no longer be construed as were the earlier leases by this and the state court, but that they must be taken as grants of the right to use the water without any power reserved in the state to abandon the canal or to devote it to other uses.\n Even if it be assumed that there was a complete nonuse by the public of the canal for purposes of navigation as early as 1895, which seems to be in dispute, neither the court below nor the appellee points to any act or omission on the part of the state indicating abandonment of the canal by it as an instrument of navigation before the act of the Legislature of 1927, or any act devot- \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 805]\n\u00a0\n ing it to other purposes, other than the making of leases or grants which, as before, purported to deal only with surplus waters not required for navigation. Instead, reliance is placed on the fact that there had been a gradual abandonment of the use of the canal for navigation by the public.\n If, under the local law, the state might abandon the canal, while still used for navigation, by appropriate legislative action and by such abandonment terminate the rights of lessees under the act of 1840, which appellee does not deny, it is difficult to see how the failure of the public to use the canal and the continued practice of granting leases of surplus waters by administrative officials under the act of 1840, which the courts of Ohio had repeatedly held were subject to the power of the state to abandon the canal, evidenced a change of state policy or forfeited the right which had resided in it from the the beginning to abandon the canal and devote it to other purposes.\n The power to abandon the canal as an instrument of navigation resided in the state Legislature and has been exercised from time to time with respect to designated sections. \n2\n That it had not, before the act of 1927, abandoned the section of the canal now in question as such an instrumentality appears from the Act of the Legislature of April 25, 1898 ( 93 Ohio Laws, p. 370), authorizing the board of public works to grant leases or licenses to persons or corporations to operate boats in the canal by electric power and requiring them to propel the boats of others for hire and by the Act of April 9, 1902 (95 Ohio Laws, p. 118), declaring it to be the settled policy of the state to maintain the \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 806]\n\u00a0\n Miami & Erie Canal as a public canal and providing that boats built for use upon it for freight transportation should be purchased by the state at their fair value if, in the future, the policy of the state should be changed by abandonment of the canal so as to make the boats useless for transportation.\n These statutes exhibit a continuing purpose of the Legislature to stimulate and encourage the use of the canal for purposes of navigation for which it was established. The fact that such stimulation was found necessary or desirable and that it ultimately failed of its object, does not indicate, in event of failure, a purpose on the part of the state to relinquish its power to abandon the canal and devote it to other purposes unhindered by the leases of surplus waters.\n We find in this case no circumstances differentiating it from the earlier decisions in this and the Ohio courts. In each, as in the present case, the failure of the public to make sufficient use of a particular sector for transportation led to its abandonment and appropriation to other purposes and to the necessary termination of all rights under grants of surplus water which, being but incidents to the maintenance of the canal for navigation, ceased when that purpose was abandoned. The fact that some of the earlier cases involved other state canals on which there was still some navigation at the time of the granting of the leases there involved, and the additional fact that the present appellee under its supplemental agreement with the state bears the expense of maintaining and patroling the canal, we do not regard as sufficient to differentiate this case from those so long acquiesced in. Nor can the case of State ex rel. Crabbe v. Middletown Hydraulic Co., 114 Ohio St. 437, 151 N. E. 653, be taken to have overruled, sub silentio, the rule announced in the former cases which was not involved in its decision. \n\n[279 U.S. 797, 807]\n\u00a0\n The grant was of water to be taken from the river near the entrance to the canal. Appellee admits that of itself the grant imposed no obligation on the state to continue the canal in use. The only claim made by appellee under this grant is of the right to have the specified amount of water come to it through the canal so long as it is maintained as such. Consequently, appellee has no right under this grant, apart from the right claimed under its leases, to have the state maintain the canal, which latter we find to be nonexistent, and we need not decide what effect in other respects, if any, the act of 1927 had upon the grant.\n The decree below will be reversed, but the decree to be entered will be without prejudice to the rights of appellee against the city of Toledo under the Ohio statute of January 22, 1920, and under the conveyance to the city of Toledo made pursuant to it, and without prejudice to the rights of appellee under the final decree of the District Court for Northern Ohio, entered on the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the suit entitled Maumee Valley Electric Company v. City of Toledo et al.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Similar legislation authorizing the purchase of lineal part 2 by the county commissioners of Lucas county was enacted March 27, 1925. 111 Ohio Laws, p. 367.

Ed. -, decided this day, the only difference being in the nature of the grant under which appellee derives its rights to the water.\n The grant here involved is embraced in an indenture of September 1, 1842, between the commissioner of the board of public works and one Minor, as readjusted on February 23, 1846. By it Minor, a riparian owner, released and quitclaimed to the state all claims against it arising out of the use and occupation by the state of water from the Maumee river and of lands used in the construction and operation of the Wabash & Erie Canal, \n\n[279 U.S. 807, 809]\n\u00a0\n now the Miami & Erie. This release was made in consideration of a perpetual grant by the state, made after the passage of the Act of March 23, 1840 (38 Ohio Laws, p. 87), discussed at length in our opinion in No. 674, Kirk v. Maumee Valley Electric Co., supra. By the grant the state sold and conveyed a specified quantity of water 'except when otherwise necessary for the navigation of the canal' and the contract as readjusted was similarly restricted. The grant was subject to the limitations of the statute of 1840, and the rights conferred under it did not, for present purposes, differ from those considered in No. 674. They were likewise subject to the reserved power of the state to abandon the canal and devote it to other purposes, which was exercised by the Act of the Ohio Legislature of May 11, 1927 (112 Ohio Laws, p. 360). For the reasons discussed at length in No. 674, and equally applicable here, the judgment below is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLARSON v. SOUTH DAKOTA(1929)\nNo. 102\nArgued: January 8, 1929Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n The appellant, hereafter to be called the petitioner, sued the state of South Dakota, in its Supreme Court, for damages for the destruction of his ferry franchises on the Missouri river, under the authority of section 2109, South Dakota Revised Code of 1919\n\n\n Petitioner alleged in his complaint that he was granted ferry franchises under sections 8696 to 8704 of the same Code. Section 8696 provided: \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 430]\n\u00a0\n 'It shall be unlawful for any person to establish, maintain or operate upon any waters within this state any ferry, upon which to convey, carry or transport any person or property for hire or reward, without first having procured a ferry lease, as provided in this article; and where but one bank or shore is in this state, the board of county commissioners of the proper county, or the governing body of the proper city or incorporated town, shall have the same authority as if the entire stream or water were within this state so far as the banks and waters actually within it are concerned, and when any ferry lease has been granted, no other lease shall be granted within a distance of two miles from the place described, in the application for a ferry lease, as the ferry, landing across the same stream. ...'\n Section 8697 provided:\n'The board of county commissioners of the proper county or the governing body of the proper city or incorporated town to whom application shall be made for a ferry \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n lease, in the manner hereinafter provided, shall have authority and it shall be its duty to grant a ferry lease, for the term of not exceeding fifteen years to the person who shall bid and secure the highest amount of rent for the same. ...'\n\n The complaint further alleged that the state, by appropriate action of the county commissioners of Walworth county in 1916, and of those of Corson county in 1921, for a valuable consideration, granted to the petitioner exclusive leases or ferry franchises of 15 and 5 years' duration respectively, and authorized him to operate a ferry upon and across the Missouri river for such toll charges as were provided by law, in an area extending two miles in either direction from the landing point; that the petitioner accepted the ferry franchises, and invested money in the purchase of ferryboats, motorboats, landings, and buildings to equip the ferry, to the amount of $14,000. He further alleged that the state, pursuant to acts of its Legislature, during the years 1923 and 1924, constructed a steel and concrete bridge across the Missouri river at a site designated by law, upon and within the confines of plaintiff's exclusive ferry franchises and within two miles west of the point of the ferry landing; that the bridge is a free bridge and became usable about November 10, 1924; that the ferry had first been run at a loss, as expected, but that recently it had yielded over $5,000 a year profit; that by the construction of the bridge petitioner's business as a ferryman and his property right in his franchises were totally destroyed, and the investments made by him were rendered worthless, and resulted in a damage to him of $44,000, no part of which has been paid. He therefore asked judgment in that amount.\n The defendant, the state, demurred to the complaint of the petitioner, on the ground, among others, that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Supreme Court sustained the demurrer. The petitioner having failed to file an amended complaint, the original complaint was dismissed. 51 S. D. 561, 215 N. W. 880.\n An appeal to this court was allowed under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 USCA  344(a).\n The petitioner contended in the state court, and contends here, that the acts of the state Legislature, under which the bridge was constructed, impaired the obligation of the contract embodied in his ferry leases or franchises, and therefore were void, as being in conflict with the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. M. Potts, of Mobridge, S. D., and Byron S., Payne, of Pierre, S. D., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The exclusive ferry leases were contracts between the state and the petitioner. The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51. Was the building of the bridge a breach of them?\n The Supreme Court of the state has had the meaning of 'exclusive ferry franchise' before it twice before this case, in Nixon v. Reid, 8 S. D. 507, 67 N. W. 57, 32 L. R. A. 315, and in Chamberlain Ferry & Cable Bridge v. King, 41 S. D. 246, 170 N. W. 145; but these cases did not require consideration of the effect of the term as applied to anything but ferries. The court said on that subject in the present case:\n'All that is contemplated by the statute and all that was granted by the plaintiff's leases was the right to operate a ferry together with a prohibition upon the granting boards from granting other ferry leases within the granted area during the period. ... Nowhere in \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n the statute can be found or implied a provision that the state was binding itself not to construct, nor authorize the construction of, a bridge across the river within the four-mile area, or not to permit carriage by aviation across it. The fair and reasonable construction of the statute is that it refers solely to transportation by ferry.'\n\n Coming from the state Supreme Court, this language is very persuasive of the meaning of the statute, and would indicate that in its view the building of a bridge was not a breach of the ferry contracts.\n The petitioner relies on the contract clause of the federal Constitution, and is not prevented from invoking from this court an independent consideration of what the contract means, and whether by a proper construction, the building of a bridge impairs its obligation. Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 380\n, 46 S. Ct. 569; Columbia Ry. Co. v. South Carolina, \n261 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, 43 S. Ct. 306; Long Sault Development Co. v.

Hoboken Co., 1 Wall. 116, 145; The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 81; Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 436, 443.\n We must therefore treat the question as an open one and determine as an independent matter what the parties must be held to have had in mind in the use of the term 'exclusive lease.'\n The chapter of the Revised Code of the state immediately preceding that which directs the letting and granting of exclusive ferry leases provides for the building of bridges over the rivers of South Dakota. This close relation of the chapters suggests that, if bridges were intended to be forbidden by the contract, the parties would have \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n been likely to mention a bridge as a breach. But there is no mention of a bridge in the statute or contract dealing with ferries.\n On the other hand, it is argued that it was so well understood by every one, including the parties, that the erection of a bridge in the forbidden area would destroy the value of the ferry leases, and so defeat the real object of the leases, that an implication necessarily arises that a bridge would be a breach of the leases.\n Reference is made to Newburgh & C. Turnpike Co. v. Miller, 5 Johns. Ch. (N. Y.) 101, 111, 9 Am. Dec. 274, a decision by Chancellor Kent. That was a suit to enjoin as a nuisance the construction and use of a bridge over the Wallkill river, upon which the plaintiff had a toll bridge of more than 10 years' standing, and the injunction was granted. The Chancellor said:\n'It was observed in the case of Ogden v. Gibbons (4 Johns. Ch. (N. Y.) 150, 160), and shown to be a principle of the common law, that if one had a ferry by prescription, and another erected a ferry so near it as to draw away its custom, it was a nuisance, for which the injured party had his remedy by action. The same law and remedy were applied to the case of a fair or market, in which an individual had a freehold interest, if another fair or market was erected or used within its vicinity. The same doctrine applies to any exclusive privilege created by statute; all such privileges come within the equity and reason of the principle; no rival road, bridge, ferry, or other establishment of a similar kind, and for like purposes, can be tolerated so near to the other as materially to affect or take away its custom. It operates as a fraud upon the grant, and goes to defeat it. The consideration by which individuals are invited to expend money upon great, and expensive, and hazardous public works, as roads and bridges, and to become bound to keep them in constant and good repair, is the grant of a right to an exclusive toll. \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n This right, thus purchased for a valuable consideration, can not be taken away by direct or indirect means, devised for the purpose, both of which are equally unlawful.'\n\n It will be observed that the facts there related to two bridges, and the case is not necessarily an express authority holding that an exclusive franchise for a ferry excludes a bridge. Yet it may be strongly argued from the language used that that is what the Chancellor had in mind.\n We think, however, a broader question arises in the proper construction of a public grant like this. The leading case on the subject in federal jurisprudence is that of Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 547. In that case the Legislature of Massachusetts incorporated a company to build a bridge over the Charles river where a ferry stood, granting it tolls. Years after, the Legislature incorporated another company for the erection of another bridge within 800 feet of the original one. The new bridge was to become free after a few years, and at the time of the litigation it had become actually free. The Charles River Bridge was deprived of the tolls and its value was destroyed. Its proprietors filed a bill against the proprietors of the Warren Bridge, for an injunction against the use of the bridge as an act impairing the obligations of a contract and repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts (7 Pick. 344) dismissed the bill and the case case was brought by error to this court, which affirmed the judgment of the Massachusetts court. The principle of the case is that public grants are to be strictly construed, that nothing passes to the grantee by implication. The court cited United States v. De la Maza Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 738; Jackson ex dem. Hart v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280, 289; Beaty v. Lessee of Knowler, 4 Pet. 152, 165; Providence Bank v. Billings and Pittman, 4 Pet. 514, 561. In the last case Chief Justice Marshall said, of an asserted limitation on the taxing power:\n'As the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished, that community has a right to \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 436]\n\u00a0\n insist that its abandonment ought not to be presumed, in a case in which the deliberate purpose of the state to abandon it does not appear.'\n\n The case then before the court was held to be subject to the same rule, although one of a corporate grant. The act of incorporation was silent in respect to the contested power. The argument made in favor of the proprietors of the Charles River Bridge was the same as that of the Providence Bank, namely, that the power claimed by the state, if it existed, must be so used as not to destroy the value of the franchise granted to the corporation. The argument was rejected.\n Chief Justice Taney, delivering the opinion in the Charles River Bridge Case, said:\n'But the object and end of all government is to promote the happiness and prosperity of the community by which it is established; and it can never be assumed that the government intended to diminish its power of accomplishing the end for which it was created. And in a country like ours, free, active, and enterprising, continually advancing in numbers and wealth, new channels of communication are daily found necessary, both for travel and trade, and are essential to the comfort, convenience, and prosperity of the people. A state ought never to be presumed to surrender this power, because, like the taxing power, the whole community have an interest in preserving it undiminished. And when a corporation alleges that a state has surrendered for 70 years its power of improvement and public accommodation, in a great and important line of travel, along which a vast number of its citizens must daily pass, the community have a right to insist, in the language of this court above quoted, 'that its abandonment ought not to be presumed, in a case in which the deliberate purpose of the state to abandon it does not appear.\" \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 437]\n\u00a0\n The same principle is declared in Fanning v. Gregoire, 16 How. 524, 534, Wright v. Nagle, \n101 U.S. 791\n, 796, Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co. v. Wheeling Bridge Co., \n138 \nU.S. 287, 293\n, 11 S. Ct. 301, and Williams v. Wingo, \n177 \nU.S. 601, 603\n, 20 S. Ct. 793. Speaking for the court in the last case Mr. Justice Brewer said:\n\n'A contract binding the state is only created by clear language, and is not to be extended by implication beyond the terms of the statute. Fanning v. Gregoire, 16 How. 524 (14 L. Ed. 1043), is in point and decisive.'\n\n The cases above cited are not exactly on all fours with the specific issue presented here, but they serve to show with great emphasis the necessity for one who relies upon a public grant as a basis for a private right, to bring it expressly within the grant or statute.\n It is clear from them that in determining the effect of a public grant to an individual the principle 'ut res magis valeat quam pereat' is not to be applied in his favor or an implication to be made enlarging his grant, as seems to have been the view of Chancellor Kent in Newburgh & C. Turnpike Co. v. Miller, supra.\n The contention that an exclusive ferry franchise should be construed to cover all methods of travel and transportation across the water is rejected in Dyer v. Tuskaloosa Bridge Co., 2 Port. 296, 27 Am. Dec. 655 ( Ala. 1835); Piatt v. Covington & Cincinnati Bridge Co., 8 Bush, 31 (Ky. 1871); Snidow v. Board of Supervisors of Giles County, 123 Va. 578, 96 S. E. 810 (1918); Dibden v. Skirrow, (1908) 1 Ch. 41. There are many strong dicta to this same effect. Morey v. Orford Bridge, Smith 91, 95 (N. H. 1804); Piscataqua Bridge v. New Hampshire Bridge, 7 N. H. 35, 59 (1834); Bush v. Peru Bridge Co., 3 Ind. 21, 24 (1851); Parrot v. Lawrence, Fed. Cas. No. 10772 (C. C. Kan. 1872); State ex rel. McPherson Bros. v. Superior Court, 142 Wash. 284, 291, 252 P. 906 (1927). \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 438]\n\u00a0\n The great weight of authority holds that a contractual term forbidding a ferry or a toll bridge does not exclude a railroad bridge. Mohawk Bridge Co. v. Utica & Schenectady R. R., 6 Paige, 554, 564 (N. Y. 1837); McLeod v. Savannah, Albany & Gulf R. R., 25 Ga. 445 (1858); Bridge Proprietors v.

Hartford & New Haven R. R., 17 Conn. 40, 42 Am. Dec. 716 (1845); Id., 17 Conn. 454, 44 Am. Dec. 556 (1845).\n There is some conflicting authority on the main question. Gates v. McDaniel, 2 Stew. 211, 19 Am. Dec. 49 (Ala. 1829); Norris v. Farmers' & Teamsters' Co., 6 Cal. 590, 65 Am. Dec. 535 (1856); Menzel Estate Co. v. City of Redding, 178 Cal. 475, 174 P. 48 (1918); Blanchard v. Abraham, 115 La. 989, 40 So. 379 (1906). But all of these cases are distinguishable, in that the infringing bridge or ferry was established without legal authority, and there were other reasons, such as obstruction to navigation, special statutes, or injury to tangible property, which affected the decisions.\n The strongest case for the appellant is Mason v. Harper's Ferry Bridge Co., 17 W. Va. 396 (1880), where a statute forbidding other ferries was held to give an exclusive right to transportation over the river and hence to prohibit rival bridges as well, but the court said that the Legislature could take away at any time all the exclusive privileges of the proprietors theretofore existing.\n In Hopkins v. Great Northern Railway, 2 Q. B. D. 224, 230 (1877), a railway company built a railway bridge and a footbridge across a river one- half mile above an ancient ferry, which then went out of business. It was held that the ferry could not obtain compensation for either bridge, the railway being necessary for new traffic, and the footbridge being used by those going to the railway station or by trespassers. There was a dictum by a court of dis- \n\n[278 U.S. 429, 439]\n\u00a0\n tinguished English judges 'that the owner of a ferry has not a grant of an exclusive right of carrying passengers and goods across the steam by any means whatever, but only a grant of an exclusive right to carry them across by means of a ferry.'\n We can hardly say, therefore, from the weight of authority, that an exclusive grant of a ferry franchise, without more, would prevent a legislature from granting the right to build a bridge near the ferry. Following the cases in this court in its limited and careful construction of public grants, it is manifest that we must reach in this case the same conclusion.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLASH'S PRODUCTS CO. v. U S(1929)\nNo. 98\nArgued: December 7, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. R. Serven and Richard D. Daniels, both of Washington, D. C ., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of certain taxes paid under the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,  628, 40 Stat. 1057, 1116). By section 628 there is imposed on 'soft drinks, sold by the manufacturer, ... in bottles or other closed containers, a tax equivalent to ten per centum of the price for which so sold.' This tax was paid by the petitioner, calculated at ten per centum of the sum actually received by it for the goods sold. But the petitioner had notified its customers beforehand that it \n\n[278 U.S. 175, 176]\n\u00a0\n paid the ten per cent. tax and it contends that in this way it passed the tax on and that the true price of the goods was the sum received less the amount of the tax. The phrase 'passed the tax on' is inaccurate, as obviously the tax is laid and remains on the manufacturer and on him alone. Heckman & Co. v. I. S. Dawes & Son Co., 56 App. D. C. 213, 12 F.(2d) 154. The purchaser does not pay the tax. He pays or may pay the seller more for the goods because of the seller's obligation, but that is all. Still the question as to the meaning of the statute remains.\n The petitioner supports its position by a regulation of the Commissioner that when the tax is billed as a separate item it is not to be considered as an increase in the sale price. Naturally a delicate treatment of a tax on sales might seek to avoid adding a tax on the amount of the tax. But it is no less natural to avoid niceties and to fix the tax by the actual price received. Congress could do that as properly as it could have added one-tenth to the tax on the price as fixed by the other items determining the charge to the buyer. The price is the total sum paid for the goods. The amount added because of the tax is paid to get the goods and for nothing else. Therefore it is part of the price, and if the statute were taken literally, as there would be no reason for not taking it if it were now passed for the first time, there might be difficulty in accepting the Commissioner's distinction even if the tax were made a separate item of the bill. But if, in view of the history in the Solicitor General's brief, we assume with him that the practice of the Commissioner has been ratified by Congress, we agree with his argument that the petitioner must take the privilege as it is offered. It did not bill its tax as a separate item, and the Commissioner's Regulations notified it that 'if the sales price of a taxable beverage is increased to cover the tax, the tax is on such increased sales price' although they purported to make a different rule 'when the tax is billed as a separate item.' \n\n[278 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n There has been some difference of opinion in the lower Courts but we regard the interpretation of the law as plain.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAWRENCE v. ST. LOUIS-SAN FRANCISCO RY. CO.(1929)\nNo. 99\nArgued: December 3, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n C. B. Ames and Edwin Dabney, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n C. B. Stuart, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was before us in Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co ., \n274 \nU.S. 588\n, 47 S. Ct. 720. There, we reversed the decree granting an interlocutory injunction. Now the case is here on appeal from the final decree, which granted a permanent manent injunction. ( D. C.) 30 F.(2d) 458. This decree was entered upon motion to dismiss the bill and supplemental bill. For the main facts reference is made to our earlier opinion. The supplemental bill sets forth the occurrences since entry of the interlocutory decree. It is largely with these that we are now concerned.\n The petition for appeal from the interlocutory decree prayed 'that the proper order touching security be made without superseding the decree.' The appeal was allowed upon the filing of the usual bond for costs. The District Court, three judges sitting, had offered to the appellants the opportunity of suspending the interlocutory decree by giving a supersedeas bond. The offer was declined. Then the decree was made effective upon the railway's filing a bond in the sum of $50,000. Immediately thereafter, the railway commenced removal of its shops and division point from Sapulpa to West Tulsa. Before the interlocutory decree was reversed by us the removal had been completed; and the new shops and division point had been put into complete operation at West Tulsa. Promptly after our decision, the appellants applied to the District Court for an order requiring that forthwith, and before any further proceeding be taken in the cause, the railway restore the conditions with respect to its shops and division point existing prior to the issue of the interlocutory injunction; and specifically 'that it be required to re-build its trackage at Sapulpa as such trackage then existed; to return to Sapulpa all machinery and employees which have been removed by reason of said \n\n[278 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n interlocutory injunction; to restore the runs of its trains and particularly its freight trains so that Sapulpa will be the division point for said runs as it was before the issuance of said interlocutory injunction.'\n The District Court denied the motion. Instead, it issued an order that the railway company 'as a preliminary step to further hearing of this cause' apply to the Corporation Commission of the state to dissolve the restraining orders theretofore made by it, restraining removal of the shops and division point, and to ratify the removal which had been effected. The railway made application as directed; and the commission set it for hearing. Then these appellants objected to any consideration of the application by the commission, unless and until the railway should have returned its shops and division point to Sapulpa. Their contention was that in making the removal, although under the protection of the interlocutory injunction, the railway acted in contempt of the commission's earlier order restraining such action; and that, for this reason, it should not be heard by the commission until it had purged itself of the contempt. The commission sustained the objection. Thereupon, the railway filed its supplemental bill setting forth these and other facts; and the case went to final hearing in the District Court.\n The appellants contend that it was error to grant the permanent injunction, because the suit was prematurely brought. They argue that the statute requiring application to the commission before removal of the shops was a valid exercise of the police power; that this court reversed the interlocutory decree because the railway company had omitted to make such application before seeking relief in the federal court; that the removal of the shops, although under the protection of the interlocutory injunction, was an abuse of the process of the court; that this action constituted a contempt of the commission; \n\n[278 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n and that, since the railway did not offer to purge itself of the contempt by restoring the status quo, and the commission has refused to condone it, the District Court erred in granting the relief prayed.\n The contention is unsound. The purpose of the restraining order, issued upon the filing of the bill, had been to maintain the status quo. It, therefore, contained a clause ordering 'that the plaintiff in this case take no action toward removing its shops, division point or changing the runs of its trains, until further order of this Court.' This clause was omitted from the interlocutory decree. The purpose of the injunction thereby granted was not, as in Vanzandt v. Argentine Mining Co. (C. C.) 48 F. 770; Silver Peak Mines v. Hanchett (C. C.) 93 F. 76; and Twenty-One Mining Co. v. Original Sixteen to One Mine (C. C. A.) 240 F. 106, to maintain the status quo, but to prevent interference with the desired change. 'The interlocutory decree,' as we have said, 'set the railway free to remove the shops before the case could be heard on final hearing.' \n274 \nU.S. 588, 594\n, 47 S. Ct. 720. The District Court had, when it issued the injunction, jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter; and it has never relinquished its jurisdiction. It is true that this court has held that the interlocutory decree was improvidently granted. But it did not declare that the decree was void. \n274 \nU.S. 588, 591\n, 592 S., 47 S. Ct. 720, 723 (71 L. Ed. 1219). Compare Arkansas Commission v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. R. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 597, 598\n, 47 S. Ct. 724. The interlocutory injunction, until dissolved by our decision, was in full force and effect. The appellants refused to assume the risk attendant upon suspending the decree by means of a supersedeas bond. The appeal did not operate as a supersedeas. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 3 S. Ct. 136; Leonard v. Ozark Land Co., \n115 \nU.S. 465\n, 6 S. Ct. 127. Compare Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 U.S. 658\n, 668-669, 47 S. Ct. 222.\n Thus, the interlocutory decree relieved the railway from any duty to obey the restraining order of the com- \n\n[278 U.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n mission. Because such was its effect, the lower court required the railway to furnish the $50,000 bond. By availing itself of the liberty given to remove the shops and division point, the railway assumed the risk of being required to restore them if it should be held that the interlocutory injunction was improvidently granted, see Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 8, 17; Arkadelphia Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 U.S. 134\n, 145-146, 39 S. Ct. 237, and also the risk of having to compensate the appellants, to the extent of $ 50,000, for any damages suffered by reason of the removal. But it was clear that, upon final hearing, the railway might prove that it was entitled to a permanent injunction; and the District Court was not obliged to order restitution meanwhile. If it had not, when entering the interlocutory decree, required that bond be given, no damages could have been recovered on the dissolution of the injunction. Russell v. Farley, \n105 U.S. 433\n, 437; Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie Ry. Co. v. Washburn Lignite Coal Co., \n254 \nU.S. 370, 374\n, 41 S. Ct. 140. Although it required the bond, and this court held that the interlocutory injunction had been improvidently issued, the District Court could, in its discretion, refuse to assess the damages until it should, after the final hearing, have determined whether the plaintiff was entitled to a permanent injunction. See Redlich Mfg. Co. v. John H. Rice & Co. (D. C.) 203 F. 722. It might then refuse to allow recovery of any damages, even if the permanent injunction should be denied. See Russell v. Farley, \n105 U.S. 433\n, 441-442\n\n\n Moreover, the reasons for not requiring restitution before final hearing were persuasive. It appears that there was nothing in the new location, which could in any wise affect injuriously the health of the railway's employees. The location of the shops at West Tulsa and the vicinity in which employees may live are sanitary. The removal to West Tulsa had cost $150,000. It had resulted in a \n\n[278 U.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n monthly saving of at least $33,500. It had effected a vast improvement of the interstate and other service. To restore the shops and division point to Sapulpa and make there the improvements essential to good service would require an outlay of $3,000,000, besides the expenditure of $300,000 for the shops; and it would entail, in addition, the operating expenses then being saved. Even with such large expenditure, restoration of the shops and division point to Sapulpa would inevitably impair interstate and other passenger and freight service. On these facts, which were established by affidavits filed in opposition to the motion to compel restitution, it must have seemed to the District Court at least probable that upon final hearing a permanent injunction would issue; and that to order restitution meanwhile would be, not merely an idle act, compare Goltra v. Weeks, \n271 \nU.S. 536, 549\n, 46 S. Ct. 613, but one imposing unnecessary hardship on the railway and the public.\n We have no occasion to pass upon the constitutionality of the state statute. The facts just stated were later set forth in the supplemental bill of complaint, and by submission on motion to dismiss the bill and supplemental bill were admitted on the final hearing. Assuming the statute to be valid, an order of the commission denying leave to remove would, on these facts, clearly have violated the commerce clause. Compare McNeill v. Southern Railway Co., \n202 \nU.S. 543, 561\n, 26 S. Ct. 722. The commission's refusal to hear the application was tantamount to such an order. The railway was not in contempt. The terms of the restraining order had been superseded by the interlocutory injunction. To refuse to hear the application, which the District Court had directed the railway to make, was an attempt to inflict punishment for an innocent act.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEONARD v. EARLE(1929)\nNo. 260\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. L. Rawls, of Baltimore, Md., for appellants.\n Messrs. Robert H. Archer and Thomas H. Robinson, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Maryland, the business of oyster packing is important and for many years has been licensed and taxed as a privilege. Most of the live oysters having been taken by tongs or dredges from bottoms in Maryland-a small per cent. come from Virginia and New Jersey-are sold to packers. At some convenient place on shore, they are shucked; the edible portion is placed in containers and shipped to points throughout the Union. Formerly, the detached shells had no commercial value and often were disposed of by dumping into the bay. Later they came into demand and were commonly sold for use in road-making, manufacture of fertilizer, chicken feed, etc.\n Investigation disclosed that the producing beds were being rapidly exhausted. A committee of experts re- \n\n[279 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n ported to the Legislature that the only practicable method of preventing their destruction was to place empty shells upon them, and thus furnish the support and lime essential to growth of spat.\n Thereupon, chapter 119, Act of 1927-the statute here in question and printed below1-was enacted. This re- \n\n[279 U.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n quires those who buy oysters and prepare them for market at a fixed place to take out a license 'in the nature and form of a contract between the state of Maryland and the applicant,' which shall provide for payment of $ 25; also that the 'licensee must turn over to the state of Maryland at least ten per cent. of the shells from the oysters shucked in his establishment for the current season,' to be removed by August 20th, or, at the discretion of the conservation department, to pay their equivalent in money.\n Appellants own land and buildings in Dorchester county used by them in the packing business 'for several years last past' and they intend to continue in the business. During the season of 1926 they packed 50,000 bushels. At the proper time-August 30, 1927-they duly applied to defendant for a license to conduct operations during the season following and offered to pay the designated fee of $25.50. But they refused to agree to deliver to the state 10 per cent. of the empty shells, or to pay their market value, upon the ground that the statutory \n\n[279 U.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n provision requiring this was contrary to State and Federal Constitutions. Upon refusal of the application they asked the state court for an appropriate writ of mandamus. Judgment went against them and was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n Here appellants do not deny the power of the state to declare their business a privilege and to demand therefor reasonable payment of money. Their main insistence is that exaction of 10 per cent. of the empty shells, or equivalent market value at the election of the commission, would be a taking of their property for public use without compensation. They also suggest that this would unduly burden interstate commerce, would deny them equal protection of the laws, and, finally, that to compel storage of the shells until taken by the state would unlawfully deprive them of the use of their premises.\n We find no reason to doubt the power of the state to exact of each oyster packer a privilege tax equal to 10 per cent. of the market value of the empty shells resulting from his operations. This, we understand, is not questioned by counsel. And as the packer lawfully could be required to pay that sum in money, we think nothing in the Federal Constitution prevents the state from demanding that he give up the same per cent. of such shells. The result to him is not materially different. From the packer's standpoint empty shells are but ordinary articles of commerce, desirable because convertible into money. Their value is not large and the part taken by the state will be so used as greatly to advantage the business of packing. The purpose in view is highly beneficent and the means adopted are neither arbitrary nor oppressive. The Federal Constitution may not be successfully invoked by selfish packers who seek to escape an entirely reasonable contribution and thereby to thwart a great conservation measure generally approved. \n\n[279 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 77 (19 L. Ed. 101), this court, through Mr. Chief Justice Chase, said:\n'The extent to which it (the power to tax) shall be exercised, the subjects upon which it shall be exercised, and the mode in which it shall be exercised, are all equally within the discretion of the Legislatures to which the states commit the exercise of the power . ... If, therefore, the condition of any state, in the judgment of its Legislature, requires the collection of taxes in kind, that is to say, buy the delivery to the proper officers of a certain proportion of products, or in gold and silver bullion, or in gold and silver coin, it is not easy to see upon what principle the national Legislature can interfere with the exercise, to that end, of this power, original in the states, and never as yet surrendered.'\n\n Cooley on Taxation (4th Ed.) vol. 1,  23, p. 92:\n'Taxes are generally demanded in money, and any tax law will be understood to require money when a different intent is not expressed. But if the condition of any state, in the judgment of its Legislature, shall require the collection of taxes in kind-that is to say, by the delivery to the proper officers of a certain proportion of products- or in gold or silver bullion, or in anything different from the legal tender currency of the country, the right to make the requirement is unquestionable, being in conflict with no principle of government, and with no provision of the federal Constitution. Instances of taxes in kind occurred in the colonial period.'\n\n And see French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n181 \nU.S. 324, 329\n, 21 S. Ct. 625.\n Appellants' business is local in character, and has no such intimate connection with interstate commerce as to exempt it from control by the state. The mere fact that some of the live oysters come from other states does not change the character of the enterprise. Browning v. Way- \n\n[279 U.S. 392, 398]\n\u00a0\n cross, \n233 \nU.S. 16\n, 34 S.

UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 183\nArgued: Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n Major in Marine Corps, retired in 1911 because of wounds received in battle, held not entitled to have years spent by him in inactive service on the retired list counted in determining the amount of his base or period pay under Act March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 932, Rev. St.  1274, 1612, 1622 (10 USCA  971, 34 USCA  971, 681), Act June 10, 1922,  17 (10 USCA  972), Act May 11, 1908, 35 Stat. 108, Rev.

George A. King, William B. King, and George R. Shields, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 41]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., and Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on writ of certiorari, granted October 8, 1928, under section 3(b) of the Act of February 13, 1925 (28 USCA  288), to review a judgment of the Court of Claims (64 Ct. Cl. 384) denying recovery of additional pay claimed to be due to petitioner as a major in the Marine Corps on the retired list. Petitioner, because of wounds received in battle, was retired on September 30, 1911, when his active service was a little more than thirteen years. He was later, at various times, detailed to active duty, making his total active service, both before and after his retirement, more than seventeen years. His service, both active and retired, amounted to more than twenty-seven years at the time this suit was brought. The question presented is whether the Court of Claims correctly held that the years spent by him in inactive service on the retired list could not be counted in determining the amount of his base or period pay as an officer on the retired list.\n The pay and allowances of officers of the Marine Corps and provisions for their retirement are in general the same as those of like grades in the Army. R. S.  1612, 1622 (34 USCA  971, 681). Under R. S.  1274 ( 10 USCA  971), officers retired from active service are entitled to receive 75 per cent. of the pay 'of the rank upon which they are retired.' Before the Act of June 10, 1922, c. 212, 42 Stat. 625, officers in the Army received pay based upon rank, $2,500 a year in the case of a major (R. S.  1261), increased to $3,000 by Act of May 11, 1908, c. 163, 35 Stat. 106, 108, and a certain additional amount, termed 'longevity pay,' based on length of service. Rev. St.  1262, 1263, and Act of June 30, 1882, c. 254, 22 Stat. 117, 118.\n In United States v. Tyler, \n105 U.S. 244\n, decided in the October term, 1881, this court held that under the appli- \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n cable statutes a retired army officer was entitled to count the period during which he had been on the retired list in computing longevity pay. The effect of this decision was modified by the Act of March 2, 1903, c. 975, 32 Stat. 927, 932, which provided that, 'except in case of officers retired on account of wounds received in battle,' officers then or later retired should not receive further increases in longevity pay for retired service. Under these provisions the petitioner was entitled, after his retirement in 1911, to 75 per cent. of the base pay of a major, $3,000 a year, and, as his retirement was because of wounds received in battle, he was permitted by the Act of 1903 to count his period of retirement in determining the amount of his longevity pay.\n By the Act of June 10, 1922,1 revising generally the scheme of service pay, a new schedule of base and longevity pay was adopted. The amount of base pay was fixed with reference to specified pay periods, and was made to depend both upon rank and length of service. Under it, majors who had completed fourteen years of service were to receive fourth period pay of $3,000 per annum, \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n and majors of twently-three years of service fifth period pay of $3,500. It also provided that an officer should receive an increase of 5 per cent. of the base pay of his period for each three years of service up to thirty years, with certain limitations not now important.\n As this act, effective July 1, 1922, provided that it should not operate to authorize an increase or decrease in the pay of officers on the retired list on June 30, 1922, the petitioner continued after its enactment, as before, to be entitled to base pay of $3,000 a year as fixed by the Act of May 11, 1908, and to longevity pay as fixed by other applicable provisions of the statutes. But by the Act of May 8, 1926, c. 274, 44 Stat. 417 (10 USCA  972a), enacted 'to equalize the pay of retired officers,' the benefits of the Act of June 10, 1922, were to some extent extended to officers retired on or before June 30, 1922, by providing that the retired pay of such officers should not be less than that provided for 'officers ... of equal rank and length of service retired subsequent to that date.'\n Petitioner has received longevity pay as a major of twenty-seven years' service, his right to which is not \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 44]\n\u00a0\n contested. He has also received 75 per cent. of the base pay for the fourth period as prescribed by the Act of June 10, 1922, for a major of more than fourteen years' service. If entitled to base pay calculated on the twenty-seven years of his total active and inactive service, he should receive, under the provisions of the 1926 act, the benefit of the higher pay of the fifth period; 75 per cent. of the difference between this pay and the base pay for the fourth period being the amount involved in the present suit.\n It is not denied that petitioner should be allowed to count his entire period of active service, including that since his retirement, of more than seventeen years, which would entitle him to pay of the fourth period which he is now receiving, and it is argued by petitioner that the benefits of the Act of June 10, 1922, which by the Act of May 8, 1926, were extended to all retired officers, include, in the case of petitioner, the right to count inactive service in computing base pay. This claim is based on the provision of the Act of March 2, 1903, allowing officers whose retirement was on account of wounds received in battle, as was petitioner's to count retired service in computing longevity pay and on the clause in the act of 1922, which provides that 'for officers in the service on June 30, 1922, there shall be included in the computation all service which is now counted in computing longevity pay.'\n That this latter clause, when enacted, was intended to include only officers then in active service is, we think, apparent on an inspection of the whole 1922 act. As already noted, the pay of officers on the retired list remained unaffected by this legislation at the time of its enactment. Section 1 expressly stipulated that the act should not authorize any increase in the pay of officers already retired on June 30, 1922, and this provision must be read with the next sentence, save one, on which the petitioner relies. Having by the first clause excluded \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n retired officers from any increase authorized by the act, the later provision for computing the pay of 'officers in service' by including all service then counted in computing longevity pay must be taken to have referred only to officers on the active list.\n The Equalization Act of May 8, 1926, was passed in order to correct certain inequalities in the pay of retired officers, due to the fact that the act of 1922 was not, by its terms, applicable to officers retired before its effective date, and also to continue the former policy, exemplified by R. S.  1274 (10 USCA  971), of securing to retired officers proportionate benefits of increased pay legislation affecting officers on the active list. See House Report No. 857, Sixty-Ninth Congress, First Session.\n But in carrying out this purpose, the 1926 act did not strike down the provision of the 1922 act expressly excluding from its benefits officers then retired and, as so modified, apply it to those officers. Had it done so, it would more certainly have secured to officers retired before the effective date of the earlier act the benefit of the clause allowing all service counted in computing longevity pay to be included in the computation of base pay. Instead, by its terms, the act of 1926 implies a comparison with an officer benefited by the 1922 act; that is, so far as the clause of that act in question is concerned, an officer in active service on July 1, 1922\n\n\n Even assuming, as petitioner argues, that under the provisions of the 1922 act an officer then in active service would be entitled to count prior service while retired on account of wounds received in battle, in computing his base pay, which is not free from doubt,2 it seems unlikely that Congress, by the Equalization Act of 1926, meant to set up as a standard of comparison, a case so exceptional \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 46]\n\u00a0\n as that of an officer reappointed to active service after being retired, chancing to be engaged in such service on the operative date of the 1922 act. It is argued by the government that section 24 of the Act of June 4, 1920, c. 227, 41 Stat. 759, had rendered reappointments from the retired to the active service (as distinguished from temporary assignments of retired officers to active duty, like that of petitioner) practically impossible, except by special act of Congress. The act is open to such a construction, for it limited the number of commissions permitted in each rank, provided that vacancies should be filled from senior active officers of next lower rank and thus seemingly terminated the former practice of permitting appointments to the active service from those on the retired list.\n It seems more reasonable to believe that Congress in general legislation of this character contemplated comparison only to a more universal standard-the normal case of an officer continually in active service until his retirement after July 1, 1922, and that consequently the 1926 act should not be read to extend to officers retired before 1922; the benefits of the clause permitting active officers alone to include all service counted in computing longevity pay. There is nothing in the 1926 act expressly indicating an intention of Congress to allow to an officer retired in 1911, the same base pay as that given to one who, appointed at the same time, had continued in active service until after the date of the 1922 act-which is what petitioner contends. Moreover, the construction adopted by us is more in consonance with the policy seemingly expressed in the amendment to the 1922 act contained in the Act of May 26, 1928, c. 787, 45 Stat. 774 (37 USCA  26), that from and after July 1, 1922, only active service should authorize increases in the base pay.\n On the facts presented we need not decide whether officers in active service on June 30, 1922, and retired after that date because of wounds received in battle, were en- \n\n[279 U.S. 40, 47]\n\u00a0\n titled to count such subsequent retired service in computing their base pay.\n Recognizing the force of petitioner's argument and that the number and complexity of the statutes involved and their inept phrasing leave the question not free from doubt, we conclude that the construction given to them by the Court of Claims is the more reasonable one.\n The judgment is accordingly affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS if of the opinion that the petitioner's claim is within the words of the statutes, and should be allowed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An Act To readjust the pay and allowances of the commissioned and enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps. ...\n Be it enacted ...

Motions to quash and dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the court was without jurisdiction of the prosecution and that the grand jury had not been legally constituted, and to quash the petit jury panel, were overruled. The petitioners were tried, convicted and sentenced. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 22 F.(2d) 760; 26 F.( 2d) 465. And the cause is here for limited review. \n278 \nU.S. 587\n, 49 S. Ct. 11, 73 L. Ed. -. \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n The contentions of the petitioners are, in substance: that the District Court had no jurisdiction, because when the indictment was returned and when the case was tried, Tulsa County, in which it was alleged the offenses had been committed, was not within the territorial limits of the district; and that the grand and petit juries were not legally constituted because drawn from a jury box from which the names of all persons from Tulsa and certain other counties had been removed.\n Under section 101 of the Judicial Code, enacted in 1911 (36 Stat. 1122), Oklahoma was divided into two judicial districts-the Eastern, embracing Tulsa and 39 other counties; and the Western, the remaining counties in the state.\n In 1924-the two judges of the Eastern District not having agreed upon the division of business and assignment of cases for trial-the senior circuit judge, pursuant to section 23 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  27), made an order assigning the holding of sessions of the grand jury and the receiving of indictments, etc., for the entire district,1 and all other judicial business arising in or coming from certain designated counties to the senior district judge, and all other judicial business in or from the remaining counties, including Tulsa County, to the junior district judge, and assigning the Tulsa County cases for hearing and trial at Tulsa unless otherwise ordered by that judge.\n By an Act of February 16, 1925,2 section 101 of the Judicial Code was amended so as to divide Oklahoma into three judicial districts: the Northern, Eastern, and Western. The Northern District embraced ten counties, including Tulsa County, which previously had been in the Eastern \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n District, and two counties formerly in the Western District. The Eastern District embraced the remaining thirty counties which previously had been in that district. The senior judge of the Eastern District was assigned to that District; and the junior judge, to the Northern District. Terms of court for the Eastern District, were to be held at Muskogee, Ardmore and three other court towns, as before, and at two other places instead of Tulsa and another court town which were placed in the Northern District. And the clerk, in addition to keeping his office at Muskogee, as before, was also required to maintain an office in charge of a deputy at Ardmore. No other change was made in the court for the Eastern District. By section 5 of the Act (43 Stat. 946) it was further provided that:\n'The jurisdiction and authority of the courts and officers of the ... eastern district of Oklahoma as heretofore divided between them by the order of the senior judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals ... over the territory embraced within said northern district of Oklahoma shall continue as heretofore until the organization of the district court of said northern district, and thereupon shall cease and determine, save and except ... as to the authority expressly conferred by law on said courts, judges or officers, or any of them, to commence and proceed with the prosecution of crimes and offenses committed therein prior to the establishment of the said northern district and save and except as to any other authority expressly reserved to them or any of them under any law applicable in the case of the creation or change of the ... districts of district courts of the United States.'\n\n This last reference, it is plain, covered the general provision in section 59 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  121) that: 'Whenever any new district ... has been or shall be established, or any county or territory has been or shall be transferred from one district ... to another district ..., prosecutions for crimes and offenses committed within such district, ... \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n county, or territory prior to such transfer, shall be commenced and proceeded with the same as if such new district ... had not been created, or such county or territory had not been transferred, unless the court, upon the application of the defendant, shall order the cause to be removed to the new district ... for trial.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Northern District was organized on April 1, 1925. Thereupon, as provided by the Act of 1925, the divisional order of the circuit judge as to the Eastern District ceased to be operative; and the court of the Eastern District continued to function, without any reorganization, under the senior district judge.\n On April 7 the clerk and jury commissioner of the Eastern District removed from the jury box from which the grand and petit jurors were drawn, the names of all persons from the ten counties that had been transferred to the Northern District. Nearly two months thereafter the senior district judge, presiding in the Eastern District, made an order for the drawing of the names of grand jurors for a term to be held at Muskogee. This was one of the court towns of the Eastern District both under section 101 of the Judicial Code and the amendment of 1925, and the town at which it had been the practice to hold sessions of the grand jury for the entire district. \n4\n In consequence of the previous removal of the names of persons from the ten transferred counties, the grand jury, as drawn in pursuance of the judge's order, contained no persons from any of these counties. The indictment was returned in June, 1925, at Muskogee.\n After the return of the indictment the fact that the names of all persons from the ten transferred counties \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n had been removed from the jury box was called to the attention of the judge by the motion to quash and dismiss the indictment and the evidence offered in support thereof, on which he ruled in July. Thereafter, in December, 1925, nearly eight months after these names had been removed, he made an order directing that petit jurors be drawn from the jury box for a term of court to be held at Ardmore-another one of the court towns in the Eastern District under both section 101 of the Judicial Code and the amendment of 1925. The petit jury drawn in obedience to this order likewise contained no persons from any of the transferred counties. The trial was had at Ardmore in January, 1926, before a district judge of Kansas, sitting by assignment, and the petit jury.\n\n 1. \nThe contention that the District Court was without jurisdiction in this case rests, in substance, upon the argument that the petitioners were not indicted and tried in the court for the old Eastern District that had jurisdiction in Tulsa County, but in the separate court created by the Act of 1925 for the new Eastern District that was not the same court as that of the old Eastern District and had jurisdiction in only thirty of the forty original counties.\n This, we think, is untenable. Rightly construed, the Act of 1925-as shown especially by the specific provisions of section 5, including the reference to section 59 of the Judicial Code-did not create a new court for a new district, but merely amended section 101 of the Judicial Code by limiting the territorial jurisdiction of the court for the Eastern District, for most purposes, to certain counties, while continuing its original territorial jurisdiction for the purpose of commencing and continuing prosecutions for crimes and offenses previously committed therein. In short, the identity of the court was not changed; and it continued to be, as it had been before, the court of the Eastern District. Aside from the transfer of one of the judges, its officers continued as before, retained the custody of its records, \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n and were charged with the same duties. And while its territorial jurisdiction was reduced for most purposes, this was not changed for the prosecution of past offenses, but for that purpose remained as before-that is, as defined and ascertained by section 101 of the Judicial Code. Compare United States v. Hackett (C. C.) 29 F. 848, 849; United States v. Benson (C. C.) 31 F. 896, 898, in which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Field as circuit justice; In re Benson (C. C.) 58 F. 962, 963; In re Mason (C. C.) 85 F. 145, 148; Mizell v. Beard (D. C.) 25 F.(2d) 324, 325.\n We are further of opinion that the Act of 1925 did not contemplate that the court for the Eastern District, sitting in a dual capacity as the court for both the original and the restricted district, should be reorganized and divided into two distinct tribunals-one for the original the other for the restricted district-but that it was intended that, sitting as one and the same court, it should from time to time exercise either its original or restricted territorial jurisdiction, as occasion might require. Here, the indictment-which was entitled in the District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma and alleged specifically that the offenses had been committed in 1923 at Tulsa, 'in said district, and within the jurisdiction of this court'-was, plainly, sufficient to invoke the exercise of its jurisdiction as the court for the Eastern District sitting for the commencement and conduct of prosecutions of offenses committed prior to the amendment of 1925 within the territorial limits of the district as originally constituted.\n We therefore conclude that the petitioners were both indicted and tried in the court for the Eastern District, sitting as the court for the entire original district, including the counties that had been transferred to the Northern District after the offenses were committed. This was in accord with section 5 of the Act of 1925 and section 59 of the Judicial Code. And, as this district had been ascertained by section 101 \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n of the Judicial Code before the offenses had been committed, there was no violation of the provision of the Sixth Amendment granting an accused person the right to a trial by a 'jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.'\n\n 2. \nSince the court for the Eastern District was sitting pro hac vice as one for the entire district as originally constituted, it had authority for the purposes of the prosecution and trial to draw and summon jurors from the entire district, including the ten transferred counties. See United States v. Hackett, supra, page 849 of 29 F. It was not necessary, however, that this be done. The Sixth Amendment does not require that the accused be tried by jurors drawn from the entire district. Ruthenberg v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 480, 482\n, 38 S. Ct. 168, and cases cited. Sec. 277 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  413) provides that 'Jurors shall be returned from such parts of the district, from time to time, as the court shall direct, so as to be most favorable to an impartial trial, and so as not to incur an unnecessary expense, or unduly burden the citizens of any part of the district with such service.'\n In the situation in which the court would deal occasionally with past offenses in which jurors from the ten transferred counties would be eligible, but ordinarily with cases in which jurors from such counties would not be eligible, the judge might well have thought that it would be most favorable to impartial trials and avoid unnecessary expense or undue burden to the citizens of these ten counties to return only jurors from the thirty other counties-who would be eligible to service in all cases. The evidence, it is true, does not affirmatively disclose that he gave any such direction or required the names of the persons from the ten counties to be removed from the box; nor does it affirmatively show the contrary. But since the names of these persons had been removed \n\n[279 U.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n almost two months before he made the order to draw the grand jurors-he did not direct those names to be restored to the box-and his attention had been called to the removal of these names before making the order to draw the petit jurors from the box-it fairly may be inferred that he had either directed that the names be removed or approved the removal before making the orders for drawing the jurors.\n And even if it can be regarded as essential, under section 277 of the Judicial Code, that the judge should have given written direction to draw the jurors from part of the district only, still, as the contrary is not expressly shown, such a direction may be taken as sufficiently established by the presumption of regularity. See Steers v. United States (C. C. A.) 192 F. 1, 4. It is the settled general rule that all necessary prerequisites to the validity of official action are presumed to have been complied with, and that where the contrary is asserted it must be affirmatively shown. Nofire v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 657, 660\n, 17 S. Ct. 212, United States v. Royer, \n268 \nU.S. 394, 398\n, 45 S. Ct. 519, and cases cited.\n We find that the District Court had jurisdiction of the case; that the constitution of the grand and petit juries was not illegal; and that there was no invasion of the petitioners' rights under the Sixth Amendment. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The reason for this, as stated in the order, was that the offices and records of the marshal and district attorney were at Muskogee (a court town in Muskogee County), and it had been the practice to hold there the sessions of the grand jury for the entire district. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 43 Stat. 945, c. 233 (28 USCA  182). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] At the hearing of the motion to dismiss the indictment counsel for the petitioners, in answer to a question from the court, stated that it was not their purpose to claim the right to be tried in the Northern District. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLONDON GUARANTEE & ACCIDENT CO. v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM'N OF(1929)\nNo. 491\nArgued: March 7, 1929Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 109, 110]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Leo C. Weiler, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George C. Faulkner, Jr., of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 109, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding was begun by a petition to the Industrial Accident Commission of California to obtain an award for the death of John James Uttley Brooke, an unmarried minor 19 years of age, who was drowned in Santa Monica Bay on April 8, 1926, while in the service of the Morris Pleasure Fishing, Inc. The appellant was the insurance carrier of the employer, and the question presented in this appeal is whether the case was for the exclusive cognizance of a court of admiralty under section 256 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  371), or might be brought within the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act of California (St. Cal. 1917, p. 831, as amended).\n The petition was filed by the mother and the stepfather of the deceased before the commission, which on October 6, 1926, made its findings and held that he was not at the time of his death engaged in maritime employment, and that both he and his employer were subject to the provisions of the Compensation Act. The commission found that neither the mother nor the stepfather was dependent on him, and accordingly that the award should be limited to the reasonable expenses of burial fixed at $150.\n There was a proceeding in certiorari in the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division 2, to review the award of the commission. The District Court of Appeal found that the Workmen's Compensation Act of California did not give jurisdiction of this cause \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 116]\n\u00a0\n and annulled the award. 256 P. 857. The Supreme Court of the state reversed the District Court of Appeal, and affirmed the award of the Industrial Accident Commission. 265 P. 825. An appeal to this court was then allowed.\n The facts as shown before the commission and as stated by the District Court of Appeal were as follows:\n'The Morris Pleasure Fishing, Inc., is a corporation which carries on the business of maintaining and operating from Santa Monica Bay a small fleet of fishing vessels, for the accommodation of the public seeking recreation in deep sea fishing. In the fishing season its practice has been to have excursions daily from Santa Monica Bay to the ocean fishing grounds, a distance of three to five miles, with fixed charges both for half-day and full-day trips. For use in this business the company has several vessels, ranging from four to fourteen tons registry, equipped with gas engines and capable of cruising a distance of 500 miles. The business has been confined entirely to the maintenance of these pleasure fishing vessels and the transportation of patrons to and fro by water, except that excursionists have also been supplied with bait. As one of the necessary incidents to its business the company employs seamen to navigate its vessels; and before and at the time of the accident which occasioned Brooke's death, he was in the company's employ as an apprentice navigator and seaman. In that capacity he made daily trips as required with the company's vessels, and at times substituted as 'spare skipper' for one of the regular skippers. On April 8, 1926, one of the company's fishing vessels called W. K., of about seven tons registry, was moored, with no one aboard, in Santa Monica Bay about three-quarters of a mile to a mile from the pier. A storm having arisen, the vessel broke from her moorings early in the afternoon, and began to drift toward the shore. In an effort to save the vessel from \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 117]\n\u00a0\n destruction, Capt. Morris, as Brooke's superior officer, had Brooke and another employe , named Gregory, put off from the pier, with the captain himself, in a boat about 18 feet long, with the purpose in mind of boarding the W. K and returning her to her anchorage. But as they neared the drifting vessel, their boat was capsized by a heavy wave and all three were drowned.'\n\n The appellant contends that under section 256 of the Judicial Code this is a cause of action in admiralty, enforceable in a court of admiralty, or at common law if the latter affords a remedy, and is not a matter of which cognizance may be had under a state Workmen's Compensation Act.\n The commission contends that the matter is one of local concern which does not affect commerce or navigation and of which the commission is not deprived of jurisdiction.\n Section 256 of the Judicial Code provides that jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States in all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the several states, saving, however, to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, where a stevedore engaged in unloading a ship in navigable waters in New York was killed, and an award of compensation was made against the ship owner under the state Workmen's Compensation Act, it was held that that remedy providing for compensation under a prescribed scale for injuries and deaths of employe  without regard to fault, and being administered through a state administrative commission, was a remedy unknown to the common law and incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court, and hence was not among the common law remedies saved to suitors under section 256, and therefore such a remedy was contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The same principle was \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 118]\n\u00a0\n followed in Clyde Steamship Co. v. Walker, \n244 \nU.S. 255\n, 37 S. Ct. 545\n\n\n In Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, it was held that an addition to the saving clause of section 256, by which rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any state were given to claimants thereunder, was unconstitutional as being a delegation of legislative power to states and a defeat of the purpose of the Constitution in preserving the harmony and uniformity of maritime law.\n In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 \nU.S. 308\n, 38 S. Ct. 112, it was held that a maritime contract of employment was not affected by the California statute of frauds requiring such an agreement where not to be performed within a year to be in writing, and that such a contract was not subject to state limitation, because such limitation would materially prejudice the characteristically uniform features of the general maritime law.\n The same principle was applied in State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302, where it was sought to compel an employer of stevedores to contribute to an accident fund created by the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state. Under the same title, it was held on the same principle that workmen's compensation under a state statute could not be awarded for the death of a workman killed while engaged at maritime work under a maritime contract upon a vessel moored on navigable waters and discharging her cargo.\n In Robins Dry Dock Co. v. Dahl, \n266 \nU.S. 449\n, 45 S. Ct. 157, the same principle was recognized and enforced in a case of maritime tort suffered by one doing repair work on board a completed vessel. The case was reversed, on the ground that the liability of the employer in such a suit could not be affected by the provision of a state law regulating the duties of employers generally to furnish safe scaffolds. \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 119]\n\u00a0\n Another class of cases is illustrated by Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n, 42 S. Ct. 89. There a stevedore was killed while at work in the hold of a vessel under charter to the fuel company. The Workmen's Compensation Commission granted an award to the widow and children. This was annulled by the state court, and then the widow and children brought a suit in admiralty against the fuel company in the District Court of the United States, alleging death by negligence, and prayed for damages. The District Court was held to have jurisdiction in admiralty under La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95\n, 28 S. Ct. 664; American Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 531; The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n, 28 S. Ct. 133. The plaintiff was defeated in the admiralty suit by application of the state statute of limitations. This court thus recognized a well-established exception to the nonapplication of state statutes to admiralty jurisdiction, which is when they give a common law remedy for death by wrongful act. But this court in the Knickebocker Ice Co. Case decided that it could not extend the saving clause of section 256 to include an award under a state Workmen's Compensation Act. Such cases as the Garcia Case, supra, Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88, 73 L. Ed. -, and Great Lakes Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479\n, 43 S. Ct. 418, are therefore hardly to be regarded as real exceptions to the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty by section 256.\n Other cases, however, are cited to sustain the state jurisdiction in this case. The first and chief one is Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008. That was a proceeding to recover an award under a Workmen's Compensation Act from a shipbuilder for injuries which a carpenter received while he was working on an unfinished vessel moored in the Willamette river. The contract for constructing the vessel was nonmaritime, and although the uncompleted structure upon which the accident occurred was lying in navigable waters, neither \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 120]\n\u00a0\n Rohde's general employment nor his activities at the time had any direct relation to navigation. It was held to be a matter of merely local concern in view of the fact that recognition of the rights and liabilities of the parties under a contract between them, had been made by their consent to the local statute, that they had not consciously contracted in view of admiralty, and such an exception would not injure any characteristic feature of the general maritime law or the harmony or uniformity of that law in its international and state relations.\n In Millers' Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59\n, 46 S. Ct. 194, the plaintiff's intestate was employed as a diver by a shipbuilding company. He submerged himself from a floating barge anchored in a navigable river 35 feet from the bank, in order to saw off some timbers of an abandoned set of ways once used for launching ships which had become an obstruction to navigation. He died from suffocation for lack of air supply during his work. His representative was allowed to recover from the employer's insurer under the Texas Workmen's Compensation Law ( Rev. St. Tex. 1925, arts. 8306-8309). The facts disclosed a possible maritime tort to which the general admiralty jurisdiction might extend, except that the state compensation law prescribed an exclusive remedy. The state statute was allowed to have effect. It was thought that enforcing such a state statute would not tend to destroy the characteristic features of maritime law.\n In Alaska Packers' Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n276 \nU.S. 467\n, 48 S. Ct. 346, a person engaged by a fishing and canning company as a seaman, also as a fisherman, and then for general work in and about a cannery, was injured after the fishing season was over while standing upon the shore and endeavoring to push a stranded fishing boat into navigable waters for the purpose of floating it to a nearby dock, where it was to be lifted out and stored for the winter. It was held that the injury, even if within \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 121]\n\u00a0\n admiralty jurisdiction, was of such a local character as to be cognizable under a state compensation law, a ruling which would not injure the characteristic features or uniformity of the admiralty law.\n In Sultan Railway Co. v. Department of Labor and Industries of the State of Washington, \n277 \nU.S. 135\n, 48 S. Ct. 505, an award for injuries under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Washington (Rem. Comp. St. Supp. Wash. 1927,  7673 et seq.) was sustained. The plaintiff was engaged in assembling saw logs in booms for towage elsewhere for sale, and the breaking up of the booms which had been towed on a river to a sawmill and the guiding of the logs to a conveyor extending into the river by which they were drawn into the mill for sawing. Clearly, even if this had any admiralty feature, it had only an incidental relation to navigation. The rights and obligations of the employees and their employers could well be regulated by local rules, which would not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law.\n Nothing in these cases could apply to the case before us. They may be said to be of an amphibious character. They have an admiralty feature about them in the locality where they occurred, although even this is doubtful with respect to the Alaska Case. But the contract in the Rohde Case was nonmaritime, the ship was incomplete, and being completed under a nonmaritime contract, both parties had made a nonmaritime contract with reference to their liabilities and not in contemplation of the admiralty law. The Braud Case was one of a maritime tort. But it had no characteristic feature of the general maritime law except locality, and it was very like in its relation to the state law to the Rohde Case. The employment was not maritime, and the transaction and the circumstances thus seemed to have but one characteristic that was maritime. This was true of the Sultan Company Case. \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 122]\n\u00a0\n Other cases cited but which seem to have no application here rest on the undisputed circumstance of locality in fixing or excluding admiralty jurisdiction.\n In State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corp., \n259 \nU.S. 263\n, 42 S. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013, the tort complained of was committed upon a dock which was an extension of the land, and was not within the jurisdiction in admiralty at all.\n Smith & Son v. Taylor, \n276 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S. Ct. 228, was a case in which a longshoreman was struck by a sling while working on a stage resting solely upon a wharf and projecting a few feet over the water to or near a vessel. He was knocked into the water where some time later he was found dead. It was there held that the right of action was controlled by the state and not by the maritime law, since the blow was received on the wharf which was to be deemed an extension of the land.\n And so in Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Company, \n266 \nU.S. 171\n, 45 S. Ct. 39, where an employee engaged in the repair of a vessel resting on a dock floating on navigable waters was allowed to recover for negligence of the vessel owner in the explosion of a blau torch negligently permitted to be out of repair. It was held that repairs to a vessel while in an ordinary dry dock were not made on land, and that the admiralty jurisdiction in tort matters was settled by the locality.\n In Messel v. Foundation Co., \n274 \nU.S. 427\n, 47 S. Ct. 695, it was held that a boiler maker employed to lengthen the smokestack on the deck of a vessel lying in navigable waters, and injured by negligence of the owner through the sudden burst of hot steam, was entitled to recovery in admiralty or under the saving clause of section 256, by virtue of the Louisiana Civil Code, art. 2315, declaring that every act whatever of a man that causes damage to another obliges him by whose fault it happened to repair it. This was held equivalent to the operation of the common law, and so under the saving clause of section 256 to support a suit for dam- \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 123]\n\u00a0\n ages either in admiralty or common law. The Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 20 of 1914, as amended) gave him no right of action.\n We have thus examined all the cases in this court since Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen with respect to the efforts to apply the workmen's compensation acts in admiralty, and we have found nothing in them that would justify an award in the present case.\n Here it is without dispute that the deceased was a sailor, that his employment and relation to the owner of the vessel were maritime. It is without dispute that the vessel in the navigation of which he was employed was registered as a vessel engaged in the navigable waters of the United States in the business of transporting people for hire. He was a skipper engaged in assisting the navigation of these registered vessels from their mooring place in Santa Monica Bay to the place where the deep sea fishing was to be carried on, a distance of from 3 to 5 miles or more, all in navigable waters. The vessels were capable of navigation for 500 miles. There was no feature of the business and employment that was not purely maritime. To hold that a seaman engaged and injured in an employment purely of admiralty cognizance could be required to change the nature or conditions of his recovery under a State Compensation Law would certainly be prejudicial to the characteristic features of the general maritime law.\n Objection is made that the deceased here lost his life by drowning when he was not on a vessel in the navigation of which he had been employed as a seaman. This is immaterial. He was lost in navigable waters. He was engaged in attempting to moor and to draw into a safe place the vessel with relation to which he was employed. It is clearly established that the jurisdiction of the admiralty over a maritime tort does not depend upon the wrong having been committed on board a vessel, but \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 124]\n\u00a0\n rather upon its having been committed upon the high seas or other navigable waters. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S., 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1157.\n Another objection to the admiralty jurisdiction here is that the vessel was not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. It was employed only to run from shore to Santa Monica Bay, five or ten miles to the deep sea fishing place and then return, and all within the jurisdiction of California. This argument is a complete misconception of what the admiralty jurisdiction is under the Constitution of the United States. Its jurisdiction is not limited to transportation of goods and passengers from one state to another, or from the United States to a foreign country, but depends upon the jurisdiction conferred in article 3,  2, extending the judicial power of the United States to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\n Mr. Justice Clifford, in The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 640 (19 L. Ed. 266 ), said:\n'Difficulties attend every attempt to define the exact limits of admiralty jurisdiction, but it cannot be made to depend upon the power of Congress to regulate commerce, as conferred in the Constitution. They are entirely distinct things, having no necessary connection with one another, and are conferred, in the Constitution, by separate and distinct grants'-citing The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 452.\n\n See, also, In re Garnett, \n141 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 11 S. Ct. 840; Ex parte Boyer, \n109 \nU.S. 629, 632\n, 3 S. Ct. 434; The Propeller Commerce, 1 Black, 574, 578.\n Another objection which is pressed on us is that section 256 of the Judicial Code does not exclude the jurisdiction under the California Compensation Act, because the object of the trips was for pleasure and not for commerce. This is a misconception. Commerce is not prevented because the object of it is to serve the pleasure of passengers. The business was that of earning money by transporting people on the navigable waters of the United States, and, strictly \n\n[279 U.S. 109, 125]\n\u00a0\n speaking, it is just as much a part of commerce and of the admiralty jurisdiction as if these vessels were carrying cargoes of merchandise. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 215 et seq.. The conclusion sought to be drawn by counsel for the Commission from the Rohde and other cases is that workmen's compensation acts will apply unless their application would interfere with the uniformity of the general maritime law in interstate and foreign commerce, and there is neither here. But this omits one of the grounds for making an exception-that it shall not be prejudicial to the characteristic features of the maritime law. That is just what it would be here, for here we have a transaction on the navigable waters of the United States which in every respect covers all the characteristic features of maritime law and has no other features but those. To apply to such a case a state Compensation Law would certainly be prejudicial to those features. We must hold therefor that it was a violation of the exclusive maritime jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution to apply in this case the California Compensation Act.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissents. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N. R. CO. v. CHATTERS(1929)\nNo. 414\nArgued: March 7, 1929Decided: April 15, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 320, 321]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry McCall, of New Orleans, La., and Ashby M. Warren, of Louisville, Ky., for petitioner Louisville & N. R. Co.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 320, 322]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans. La., and H. O'B. Cooper, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner Southern Ry. Co.\n Mr. George Piazza, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a citizen of Louisiana, brought suit in the District Court for Eastern Louisiana against the Southern \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 323]\n\u00a0\n Railway Company, a Virginia corporation, and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, a Kentucky corporation, to recover for personal injuries suffered while traveling in a car of the Southern Railway in a through train from New Orleans, La., to Washington, D. C. At the time of the accident, the train was being operated by the Southern over its tracks in Virginia.\n Respondent purchased a through coupon ticket for the journey at the office of the Louisville & Nashville in New Orleans, which entitled him to passage over the line of the Louisville & Nashville from Atlanta & West Montgomery, Ala., over the Atlanta & West Point Railroad from Montgomery to Atlanta, Ga., and thence to Washington over the line of the Southern. He took passage in New Orleans on a car of the Southern, and proceeded in it on his journey until, while on the line of the Southern in Virginia, a window screen, attached to the outside of the car, became loosened and swung backward on its hinges, so as to strike and break the car window behind it and injure respondent with pieces of flying glass. The train was made up by the Louisville & Nashville in New Orleans, and was operated under an agreement among the three carriers concerned, which was not offered in evidence. But it appeared that the cars composing the train were furnished by the three carriers on the basis of their respective mileage; that each furnished locomotive power and train crews over its own line; and that each, while in possession of the train, was in exclusive control of it.\n Process against both petitioners was served on their respective agents in Louisiana, designated by them to receive service of process as required by a state law exacting formal consent by the corporation that any 'lawful process' served on the designated agent should be 'valid \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 324]\n\u00a0\n service' upon the corporation. Act No. 184 of 1924.1 The Southern, appearing specially before answer, excepted to the jurisdiction on the ground that the cause of action, which was transitory, arose outside Louisiana and not out of any business done by the Southern within that state. After a hearing, in which evidence was introduced, the exception was overruled. (D. C.) 17 F.(2d) 305. On the trial the District Court gave judgment on a verdict for respondent against both petitioners, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 26 F.(2d) 403. This court granted certiorari October 15, 1928. \n278 \nU.S. 590\n, 49 S. Ct. 26, 73 L. Ed. -.\n The Southern alone seeks a review of the order overruling its exception to the jurisdiction. The Louisville & Nashville assigns as error the refusal of the trial court to give a requested instruction to the jury. Both petitioners raise for consideration here exceptions to the charge of the court to the jury and to the admission of certain testimony.\n\n 1. \nThe Southern insists that the case as to it should have been dismissed on its exception for want of jurisdiction of the person of the corporation upon a suit in Louisiana on a cause of action arising outside that state. A foreign corporation is amenable to suit to enforce a personal liability if it is doing business within the juris \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 325]\n\u00a0\n diction in such manner and to such extent as to warrant the inference that it is present there. Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Spratley, \n172 \nU.S. 602\n, 19 S. Ct. 308; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. Alexander, \n227 \nU.S. 218\n, 33 S. Ct. 245. Even when present and amenable to suit it may not, unless it has consented (Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., \n243 \nU.S. 93\n, 37 S. Ct. 344; Smolik v. Phila. & Reading Coal Co. (D. C.) 222 F. 148), be sued on transitory causes of action arising elsewhere which are unconnected with any corporate action by it within the jurisdiction (Old Wayne Mut Life Ass'n v. McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8\n, 27 S. Ct. 236; Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S. Ct. 255).\n It is urged by the Southern that compliance with the Louisiana statute requiring a foreign corporation doing business within the state to designate an agent to receive service of process is, under the state decisions, a consent to suit only upon causes of action arising out of business conducted within the state (State ex rel. Watkins v. North American Land & Timber Co., 106 La. 621, 31 So. 172, 87 Am. St. Rep. 309; Delatour & Marmouget v. Southern Ry. Co., 4 La. App. 658; Buscher v. Southern Ry. Co., 4 La. App. 653; see Missouri Pac. R. R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., \n257 \nU.S. 533\n, 42 S. Ct. 210), which it is insisted this is not, and that in any case, in the absence of an authoritative decision by the state court, this court will give a like effect to the designation under the statute (Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Const. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 213\n, 42 S. Ct. 84). For present purposes we may assume that the effect of the designation of the statutory agent by the Southern is, as the state decisions cited seem to show, that a cause of action arising wholly outside and wholly unconnected with any act or business of the corporation within the state may not be sued upon there, and we address ourselves to the question, decisive of this branch of the case, whether the Southern, being present within the state of Louisiana, is amenable to suit, on this cause \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 326]\n\u00a0\n of action as one arising out of business done within the state, or from such action of the corporation within the state as to subject it to liability there.\n The Southern does not deny that it is carrying on some business within Louisiana or that it is subject to suit there on some causes of action. Its relation to the through train service originating in New Orleans, so far as disclosed, has already been detailed. It carries on in the state, through an office and agents of its own there located, continuous solicitation of freight and passenger traffic. See International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 579\n, 34 S. Ct. 944; International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 103\n, 30 S. Ct. 481, 24 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103; Block v. Atchison, Topeka & S. F. R. Co. (C. C.) 21 F. 529; Walsh v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. (D. C.) 256 F. 47. But see Green v. C. B. & Q. Ry., \n205 \nU.S. 530\n, 27 S. Ct. 595; People's Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., \n246 \nU.S. 79\n, 38 S. Ct. 233, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 537. It maintains its own office there for the sale of tickets for passage over its own and connecting lines. Cf. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, supra, at page 585 of 234 U. S. (34 S. Ct. 944). It has designated an agent there to receive service of 'lawful process,' which fact, being of significance in determining the extent of the jurisdiction when the corporation is doing business within the state (Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., supra), is, we think, also of decisive weight in determining its presence for purposes of suit when coupled with its other corporate activities within the state. It is, therefore, as petitioner concedes, so far present in the state as to be amenable to suit there for some purposes. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. Alexander, supra. We disregard the fact that the Southern owns the stock, or most of it, of the New Orleans Railroad Company and the New Orleans Terminal Company, Louisiana corporations owning real estate and railroad equipment there, and that its officers and theirs are the same. Peterson v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., \n205 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S. Ct. 513; Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264\n, 37 S. Ct. 280. \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 327]\n\u00a0\n The cause of action here asserted is one arising out of a contract for transportation, evidenced by the through ticket sold to respondent in New Orleans and accepted by the Southern for transportation over its line. It purported on its face to be sold by the Louisville & Nashville as agent and was sold under a joint tariff agreed to by the carriers concerned and filed by them with the Interstate Commerce Commission providing that the carrier selling the ticket acted as agent of the others. Had the ticket been sold to respondent by the Southern at its own ticket office in New Orleans, we may assume that it would not have been seriously contended that the cause of action did not arise out of the business of the Southern in Louisiana, or that the present suit could not have been maintained there, even though the wrongful act complained of took place elsewhere. But it is said that as the ticket was sold by the Louisville & Nashville, that transaction alone, under the decisions of this court, would not constitute doing business within the jurisdiction so as to make the Southern amenable to suit there. Peterson v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., supra; Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, supra; General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 250 F. 160. From this it is argued that the sale of the ticket cannot be considered any part of the business carried on within the state by the Southern and that the present cause of action is therefore not within the consent to suit given by its designation of an agent, or to be implied from its presence and transaction of business within the state.\n But the sale in Louisiana of the ticket for transportation over the Southern was made by the Louisville & Nashville under the filed joint tariff as the agent and for account of the Southern. In its legal effect it was the act of the Southern within the jurisdiction by which its obligation to respondent on the contract of carriage over its own lines became complete. It was out of this \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 328]\n\u00a0\n action within the state that the present obligation of the Southern arose, although the alleged breach of it occurred elsewhere.\n This was none the less the case because such a transaction would not of itself have been regarded as a doing of business within the state sufficient to establish the presence of the Southern there for the purpose of suit. Cf. Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., \n260 \nU.S. 516\n, 43 S. Ct. 170. Since the Southern was present and subject to suit in Louisiana, we are concerned, not with the question whether the sale of the ticket was sufficient to bring it there, but only with the question whether, being there, its liability extended to all causes of action arising out of its corporate acts within the state, including this one. No case, either in the Louisiana courts or in this court, has held that it did not. Where jurisdicting has been denied, the cause of action not only arose outside the state, but it was not shown to have arisen out of any business conducted by the corporation within it or to have had any relation to any corporate act there. Cf. Old Wayne Mutual Life Ass'n v. McDonough, supra; Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., supra; Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Const. Co., supra. In such a case, whether the jurisdiction invoked be deemed to depend upon the presence of the corporation within the state through the doing of business there, or on its consent by the designation of an agent, the implication is that the liability to suit does not extend to causes of action which have nothing to do with any act of the corporation within the state. Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Const. Co., at page 216 of 257 U. S. (42 S. Ct. 84). But where the cause of action does arise out of a corporate act within the jurisdiction, the presumption would seem necessarily to be the other way.\n In the absence of express language limiting the authority of the designated agent, there would certainly be no \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 329]\n\u00a0\n ground for assuming that the consent extends to causes of action growing out of some of its acts within the jurisdiction and not others-that respondent here might maintain an action if the ticket had been sold at the office of the Southern, but not if sold at the office of its authorized agent in the same city. Once established that the foreign corporation is within the state for purposes of suit, its presence for that purpose would seem to be coextensive with its presence for the purpose of carrying on any corporate transaction within the jurisdiction and, granted the former, its liability to suit on causes of action growing out of the latter should follow. To say that not every corporate act within the jurisdiction is sufficient to establish its presence there for the purpose of suit is very different from saying that a suit founded upon such an act may not be maintained there, once its presence and consent to suit are established.\n We decide only that, in the absence of an authoritative state decision giving a narrower scope to the power of attorney filed under the state statute, it operates as a consent to suit upon a cause of action like the present arising out of an obligation incurred within the state although the breach occurred without. See Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining Co., supra.\n\n 2. \nThe requested instruction to the jury of the Louisville & Nashville, which was refused, and the actual charge complained of, related to the alleged joint liability of the petitioners. The complaint contained no allegation that respondent's injury was due to the negligence of the louisville & Nashville. He contented himself with alleging and proving at the trial the accident and injury while he was traveling over the lime of the Southern on a through ticket purchased of the Louisville & Nashville. As already indicated, it appeared that the Louisville & Nashville had no control of the train after \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 330]\n\u00a0\n it left its own tracks and each carrier furnished its own locomotive power and train crew. Each inspected, cleaned, washed and repaired the equipment of the train. It also appeared that the ticket sold by the Louisville & Nashville contained a clause reading: 'In selling this ticket and checking baggage thereon the selling carrier acts only as agent and is not responsible beyond its own line.' The through tariff filed by petitioners with the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 380, as amended by Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 483; 49 USCA  6, contained a similar provision.\n At the close of the whole case, the Louisville & Nashville moved for a directed verdict, which was denied. The trial judge also denied its request for an instruction that if the jury found the ticket contained the clause referred to, the accident did not occur on the line of the Louisville & Nashville, and its negligence did not cause or contribute to the accident, the verdict should be for that carrier. The court also charged, in a variety of ways, that the liability for petitioners for the safe delivery of the respondent at his destination was joint and that if petitioners 'failed to satisfactorily explain the accident, then negligence will be presumed and they will therefore be liable to the passenger for whatever damage he sustained.'\n But there was no basis, either in pleading or proof, for a joint liability of both petitioners for the negligence of one. Neither of them, as a common carrier, was under any duty, either by the common law or statute, to transport or assume any responsibility for the transportation of respondent beyond its own line. St. Louis Ins. Co. v. St. Louis, V. T. H. & I. Railroad Co., \n104 U.S. 146\n, 157; see Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mineral Springs Mfg. Co., 16 Wall. 318, 324. The Louisville & Nashville, therefore, might, by stipulation on the through ticket, provide that it should not be so responsible, Missouri \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 331]\n\u00a0\n Pac. R. R. Co. v. Prude, \n265 \nU.S. 99\n, 44 S. Ct. 450; cf. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Czizek, \n264 \nU.S. 281\n, 44 S. Ct. 328; and in any case the transportation service to be performed was that of a common carrier in interstate commerce under published tariffs, and the attendant limitation of liability in the tariff became the lawful condition upon which the service was rendered, binding alike on the carrier and its patron, cf. American Ry. Express Co. v. Daniel, \n269 \nU.S. 40\n, 46 S. Ct. 15; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Priester, \n276 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 48 S. Ct. 234; Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 \nU.S. 155\n, 32 S. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501; Davis v. Cornwell, \n264 \nU.S. 560\n, 44 S. Ct. 410, and was not subject to waiver. Cf. Davis v. Henderson, \n266 \nU.S. 92\n, 45 S. Ct. 24. See Georgia, Fla. & Ala. Ry. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 36 S. Ct. 541. There was, therefore, no evidence of joint liability of the petitioners in the case, and there could be no liability of either for injury to respondent occurring beyond its own line except on the theory that its own negligence caused or contributed to the injury.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in commenting on petitioner's requested charge, to which we have referred, said that such a charge would not have been proper because it was calculated to divert the jury from the consideration of the question whether the accident was attributable to the negligence of the Louisville & Nashville. Even if for this reason the requested instruction should have been refused, the charge, to which proper exception was taken, that petitioners were jointly liable and that on this theory the jury might find a verdict against the Louisville & Nashville for an accident occurring on the line of the Southern, was plainly erroneous, as it indicated to the jury that they might find a verdict for respondent against the Louisville & Nashville, even though it had exercised due care in the preparation and inspection of the train while on its own line.\n We think also there was no evidence for the jury of negligence of the Louisville & Nashville and that the motion \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 332]\n\u00a0\n for a directed verdict in favor of that railroad should have been granted. There was no evidence of the precise cause of the loosening of the screen which caused the injury. Whether the screw which fastened it was improperly replaced by the employees of the Louisville & Nashville after cleaning the window, or whether it broke or otherwise became loosened on account of some hidden or unascertainable defect, or was loosened by others than the employees of either petitioner, does not appear. There was evidence of an inspection of the car by the Louisville & Nashville before it left New Orleans. After the car left the line of the Louisville & Nashville it came into the custody of the Atlanta & West Point Railroad Company. The occurrence of the accident after the car passed beyond the control of the Louisville & Nashville and that of the intermediate carrier to the tracks of the Southern does not admit of the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, so far as concerns the Louisville & Nashville. McNamara v. Boston & Maine R. R., 202 Mass. 491, 499, 89 N. E. 131; L. & N. R. R. Co. v. Mink, 168 Ky. 394, 182 S. W. 188; cf. Glynn v. Central Railroad, 175 Mass. 510, 56 N. E. 698, 78 Am. St. Rep. 507; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Merrill, 65 Kan. 436, 70 P. 358, 59 L. R. A. 711, 93 Am. St. Rep. 287. Without resort to this doctrine, the cause of the accident and the relation of the Louisville & Nashville to it are matters of mere speculation and conjecture which should have been withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 46 S. Ct. 564; St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Mills, \n271 \nU.S. 344, 347\n, 46 S. Ct. 520.\n The charge as to the joint liability of petitioners was also excepted to by the Southern 'in so far as it makes the Southern Railway Company responsible for the negligence of the Louisville & Nashville.' To that extent it was clearly erroneous and prejudicial to the Southern. The jury was in effect told to return a verdict against both petitioners on a finding of negligence on the part of either. \n\n[279 U.S. 320, 333]\n\u00a0\n As there was evidence of repeated inspections of the windown screens by the Southern after the car reached its line and before the accident, from which the jury might have found that there was no want of care on the part of the Southern, the jury may have found that the accident was due to the negligence of the Louisville & Nashville, and so have returned a verdict against both. Even though the issue of the Southern's own negligence was for the jury, it was entitled to have the issue submitted unprejudiced by the erroneous instruction which authorized a verdict against the Southern on the theory of joint liability if the jury should conclude that the Louisville & Nashville alone was negligent.\n\n 3. \nAs there must be a new trial, it is unnecessary to consider the rulings on the evidence which the court below thought erroneous, but not prejudicial. The order overruling the Southern's exception to the jurisdiction is affirmed. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The scope of the designation is defined by the state statute as follows:\n'Section 2.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Elwood Hamilton, of Louisville, Ky., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, granted November 19, 1928, \n278 \nU.S. 594\n, 49 S. Ct. 80, 73 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 27 F.(2d) 237, affirming a judgment of the District Court for Western Kentucky, 21 F.(2d) 68, allowing recovery from the collector of inter \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n nal revenue of federal income taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted.\n On May 19, 1899, respondents' testator procured two life insurance policies for $50,000 each upon his own life and payable to his estate. On May 19, 1908, they became fully paid-up policies, upon the payment of the last of ten annual premiums aggregating, for both policies, $78,100. Each policy stipulated that in the event of death within ten years the amount payable should be $50,000 and, from the eleventh to the twentieth year, inclusive, an annually increasing amount ranging from $50,700 in the eleventh year to $72,150 in the twentieth year. The death benefit on each policy during the year ending May 19, 1913, was $59,300. The policies participated in the surplus of the company and 'dividends' properly allocable to each were set aside or ascertainable on its books each year, but were payable only at the end of the tontine period of 20 years and only to holders of policies still in force at that time.\n The insured was given an option at the end of the period of receiving on each policy the sum of $50,000 'and in addition the cash dividend then apportioned by the company.' The insured elected to exercise this option May 19, 1919, receiving as proceeds of the two policies $120,797, representing $100,000 face value plus $20,797 dividends. The gain to him over his total premium expenditure was thus $42,697. The commissioner assessed this amount as taxable income under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057\n\n\n Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought that, under  202(a) (1) of the act, only so much of the proceeds of the policies as exceeded their value on March 1, 1913, was subject to tax. They found that the amount provisionally set aside by the company as surplus accum \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n ulations applicable to the two policies on that date was $13,600, and that it was then evident that the rate of accumulation, although not certain, would probably be greater during the later years of the tontine period than before March 1, 1913. Even at the same rate, the accumulation at the end of the period would amount to $19,428.57. Both courts, therefore, concluded that the insured might reasonably have anticipated that the policies would have been worth on their maturity date, if then in force, their face value plus the anticipated accumulations, or a total for both policies of $119,428.57. Since, under the sliding scale, the death benefits would have been even proportionately larger had the insured died before the end of the period, they decided that the combined value of the policies on March 1, 1913, was the smaller amount discounted at the rate of 4 per cent. compounded annually to that date, or $93,587.81. The taxable gain on the policies, accordingly, was taken to be the difference between this amount and the actual proceeds of the policies, or $27,209.19. A recovery was allowed of the difference between the tax as assessed and that as computed on the gain after March 1, 1915, so ascertained.\n As respondents did not ask certiorari, we may disregard their argument that the judgment below was erroneous, in that the proceeds of an insurance policy paid to the insured are not taxable income, except as the determination of that question may be involved in passing upon the assignments of error of petitioner. See Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific Paper Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 66\n, 47 S. Ct. 255.\n By the expenditure of $78,100 in premiums, the insured secured a return of $120,797, resulting in an economic and realized money gain to him of $42,697. The question of liability for the tax on this gain is different from that mooted by counsel, but not decided, in United States v. Supplee-Biddle Hardware Co., \n265 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 44 S. Ct. 546, which \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n was whether insurance upon the life of a corporate officer, paid at his death to the corporation, could be constitutionally subjected to a tax on income. Here the amount paid was not a death benefit or in the nature of a gift to a beneficiary, and was in no sense an indemnity for, or repayment of, an economic loss suffered by the insured, but was a profit or gain upon his premium investment, and would seem to be plainly embraced within the provisions of section 213 taxing 'gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,' and not exempted as such from tax by any other provision of the act. See Penn. Mutual Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523, 532\n, 534 S., 40 S. Ct. 397; Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570; Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 518\n, 41 S. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305.\n But of this total gain received by the insured a part is attributable to and accrued during the period before the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment (February 25, 1913), and of the first law taxing the income of individuals (March 1, 1913), and hence, for income tax purposes, must be deemed an accretion to capital not taxable by the income tax act enacted under the Sixteenth Amendment. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 334\n, 38 S. Ct. 540; cf. Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179\n, 38 S. Ct. 467; Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 \nU.S. 221\n, 38 S. Ct. 537. Whether or not such accretions may be constitutionally subjected to tax, we have no occasion to decide. The present act, at least, does not attempt it. But the question presented necessarily involves a determination of what part of the total gain received by the taxpayer accrued to him after March 1, 1913. In answering it, provisions of the taxing statute enacted as aids in arriving at the answer must be construed with an eye to possible constitutional limitations so as to avoid doubts as to its validity. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 408 S., 29 S. Ct. 527; United States v. Standard Brewery, \n251 \nU.S. 210, 220\n, 40 S. Ct. 139; Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204, 217\n, 42 S. Ct. 281; Bratton v. Chandler, \n260 \nU.S. 110, 114\n, 43 S. Ct. 43; Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S. Ct. 391.\n Section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides:\n'(a) That for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, the basis shall be-\n\n'(1) In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of that date.'\n\n The government insists that the policies, being nonassignable except to persons having an insurable interest in the life of the insured, had no market price, and their combined value as of March 1, 1913, did not exceed their loan or cash surrender value on that date, which alone could be realized on them, of $74,600, Regulations 45 (1920) art. 87, and that any greater value assigned to them as of that date must be rejected as contingent and speculative. But in view of the provisions of section 213(b)( 2) of the act, see Regulations 45 (1920) art. 72(b), exempting from taxation the return of premiums on the maturity of the policy, it concedes that the taxable gain of the insured may be taken at the amount, fixed by the commissioner, by which the proceeds of the policies exceeded $78,100, the total premiums paid.\n Plainly, in the present case, the $42,697 gained over premium cost of the two policies, which accrued to the taxpayer through a period of 20 years, did not all accrue in the six years following March 1, 1913. If the value on that date, for the purpose of ascertaining taxable gain, was greater than the total premium expenditure which had been completed more than four years before, there is no reasonable basis for determining the taxable gain which accrued after March 1, 1913, by deducting from the total amount received the total premium payments.\n Nor can we accept the contention of the government that the value of the policies on March 1, 1913, did not \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n exceed their loan value as of that date. The purpose of ascertaining the value of the taxpayer's property on March 1, 1913, is, as section 202 states, to measure that part of his total gain which has arisen or accrued after the enactment of any of the statutes taxing income and thus to arrive at his gain which may be taxed as income. Lynch v. Turrish, supra. Value as of that date may be disregarded, unless it serves that purpose. United States v. Flannery, \n268 \nU.S. 98\n, 45 S. Ct. 420; Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S. Ct. 390; Walsh v. Brewster, \n255 \nU.S. 536\n, 41 S. Ct. 392.\n Under the statute, market price of the taxpayer's property on that date, where ascertainable, may be resorted to as generally a sufficiently definite and trustworthy gauge of the gain which has later accrued. But, where the property has no market value, the statute must be interpreted in the light of its purpose to ascertain taxable gains accruing since March 1, 1913. Hence, in such a case, its fair value on the critical date is not necessarily what might then have been realized upon it by a forced liquidation by accepting the unfavorable loan or cash surrender value. Having in mind the purpose of the statute, we think it must be taken rather to be that part of the amount actually realized by the taxpayer which, by the use of appropriate accounting methods, can fairly be said to have accrued before March 1, 1913-its value then as compared with the value in fact later realized by the taxpayer taken as a standard.\n In applying section 202(a)(1) to an insurance policy having no market value, we are not required either by circumstances or any positive provision of statute to determine its value on March 1, 1913, by making a prediction as of that time based upon and estimate of future possibilities, as is the case in valuing for purposes of inheritance tax an interest of uncertain duration passing at the death of the testator. See Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, No. 267, October Term, 1928, \n279 \nU.S. 151\n, 49 S. Ct. 291, 73 L. Ed. -. \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n There the value as of the date of death is the very thing taxed, and can usually be determined only by speculation as to future events. Here 1913 value is at most merely a mothod of allocating a known income to the periods in which it actually accrued. It is never necessary to speculate, as did the court below, as to what might later be realized from his property by the taxpayer, nor as to what might have been realized if, on March 1, 1913, he had made some forced disposition of the property which would have precluded any taxable gain. For the necessity of ascertaining value as of March 1, 1913, can never arise until some later date when income has been produced by converting the property into money or money's worth and the amount actually realized is known, and then as we have said, only for the purpose of apportioning the total gain which has accrued between the periods before and after March 1, 1913.\n It is familiar knowledge that the source of dividend accumulations upon insurance policies is interest upon investments of the company and savings effected from estimated future expenses and from death payments covered by premiums, with appropriate 'loadings' to give a margin of safety, which the policyholders have paid. In accordance with the usual practice of life insurance comployed under the system of accounting employed by the insurer in the present case, the amount of reserve set aside by the company to meet its policy liability and dividend accumulations provisionally apportioned to each policy was ascertained or ascertainable on the bookds of the company at the end of each year. During the policy year which included March 1, 1913, the insurance reserve liability thus ascertained on each of the present policies was $40,600 and the dividend accumulation on each, which both courts below found had accrued on March 1, 1913, was $6,800, making a total of reserve and accumulations applicable to each policy of $47,400. These items with subsequent annual additions totaled, at the maturity of \n\n[279 U.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n each policy, for the former $50,000 and for the latter $10,398.50, which, taken together, made up the total payment received by the taxpayer on each policy. They constitute a complete record and determination of the actual economic gain annually accruing upon the policies which was ultimately realized by the taxpayer, and they provide an adequate basis for ascertaining the proportion of the total value realized which had accrued on March 1, 1913. The sum of the insurance reserve liability and the dividend accumulations provisionally apportioned to the two policies on March 1, 1913, their accrued value on that date, was $94,800. As that valuation is larger than that found by either of the lower courts and is supported by reliable data, we may, in the absence of other evidence, accept it as sufficiently establishing that the value found below was not more than that required to be ascertained by the statute, and so did not prejudice the rights of petitioner. It is unnecessary to consider the question mooted whether upon other evidence, not here presented, a larger value as of March 1, 1913, might have been found.\n The court below, by discounting the total estimated value of the policies at their maturity at 4 per cent., arrived at a rough approximation of their accrued value on that date. This method, however, did not ascertain that value or the taxable gain with accuracy, since it was based on an assumed instead of the actual value of the policies at maturity. It discounted the assumed value at a flat rate of interest instead of at that actually earned, and it left out of account savings from estimated expenses and death losses which, as well as actual interest earned, were taken into account in determining dividend accumulations annually ascertained and credited to the policies on the books of the company. But, as the accuracy of the computation is not questioned here, and as it gave a result of which petitioner cannot complaint, the judgment will be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACALLEN CO. v. COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS(1929)\nNo. 578\nArgued: April 25, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas Allen, of Boston, Mass., and Richard H. Wiswall, of Salem, Mass., for appellant.\n Messrs. R. Ammi Cutter, Joseph E. Warner, and F. Delano Putnam, all of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Seth T. Cole, of Albany, as amicus curiae for Tax Commission of new york.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Massachusetts, G. L. c. 63,  32, as amended by St. 1923, c. 424,  1, provides:\n'Except as otherwise provided in sections thirty-four and thirty-four A, every domestic business corporation shall pay annually, with respect to the carrying on or doing of business by it, an excise equal to the sum of the following, provided that every such corporation shall pay annually a total excise, not less in amount than one twentieth of one per cent. of the fair cash value of all the shares constituting its capital stock on the first day of April when the return called for by section thirty-five is due:\n\n'(1) An amount equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of its corporate excess.\n\n'(2) An amount equal to two and one half per cent. of that part of its net income, as defined in this chapter, which is derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.'\n\n By G. L. c. 63,  30, par. 5, as amended by St. 1925, c. 343,  1A, 'net income' is defined:\n\"Net income,' except as otherwise provided in sections thirty-four and thirty-nine, the net income for the taxable year as required to be returned by the corporation to the federal government under the federal Revenue Act applicable for the period, adding thereto any net losses as defined in said federal Revenue Act that have been deducted, and all interest and dividends not so required to be returned as net income except dividends on shares of stock of corporations organized under the laws of the commonwealth and dividends in liquidation paid from capital.' \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n Before this amendment, the definition embodied in G. L. c. 63,  30, par. 5, as amended, shortly before the passage of the last-quoted amendment, by Stat. 1925, c. 265,  1, provided:\n\n\"Net income,' except as otherwise provided in sections thirty-four and thirty-nine, the net income for the taxable year as required to be returned by the corporation to the federal government under the federal Revenue Act applicable to the period, adding thereto any net losses as defined by said federal Revenue Act that have been deducted, and, in the case of a domestic business corporation, such interest and dividends, not so required to be returned as net income, as would be taxable if received by an inhabitant of this commonwealth; less, both in the case of a domestic business corporation and of a foreign corporation, interest, so required to be returned, which is received upon bonds, notes and certificates of indebtedness of the United States.'\n\n Thus, under the original definition of net income, there was expressly excluded from the net income taxable at 2 1\/2 per cent. all interest received upon bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the United States. And the definition had the effect of excluding, in the same respect, interest on state, county, and municipal bonds.\n Appellant, a business corporation organized under the laws of Massachusetts, owned a large number of United States Liberty bonds and Federal Farm Loan bonds. The Liberty bonds by statute of the United States are expressly made exempt from all taxation imposed by any state, except estate or inheritance taxes. Chapter 56, 40 Stat. 288, 291,  7 (31 USCA  747). Federal Farm Loan bonds are issued under authority of chapter 245, 39 Stat. 360 (12 USCA  641 et seq.), and by section 26, p. 380 (12 USCA  931), declared to be instrumentalities of the United States and both as to principal and income exempt from all state taxa- \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n tion. The corporation also owned a large number of bonds of Massachusetts counties and municipalities which, when issued and acquired by the corporation, were exempt from taxation by the terms of a state statute. G. L. c. 59,  5, par. 25. Of course, in respect of United States securities, the statutory exemption is superfluous. A state tax, however small, upon such securities or interest derived therefrom, interferes or tends to interfere with the constitutional power of the general government to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and constitutes a burden upon the operations of government, and carried far enough would prove destructive. The principle set forth a century ago in Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468 (7 L. Ed. 481), has never since been departed from by this court:\n'The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow, before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract. The extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government; to any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burden on the operations of government. It may be carried to an extent which shall arrest them entirely.' Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 513\n, 27 S. Ct. 571.\n\n The taxing authorities of the state assessed against appellant, for the year 1926, a tax under the provisions of the then existing statute as first above quoted, adding, for the purpose of computing the assessment, to the amount of the net income of appellant as determined by the federal income tax returns of appellant, all sums of interest received by appellant from the foregoing United States, Farm Loan, and county and municipal bonds. Without this addition, and under the original definition of net income, the amount of the tax assessed would have been materially less.\n Appellant paid the amount assessed under protest and brought a petition for abatement of the tax under the provisions of the state law, setting forth the foregoing facts \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n and alleging the unconstitutionality, under the federal Constitution, of the statute in so far as it was held to include interest derived from the tax-exempt securities: (1) As impairing the obligation of contracts; (2) as an attempt to impose a tax upon income derived from securities and instrumentalities of the United States; (3) as depriving petitioner of its property without due process of law and denying it the equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) as an impairment and in derogation of the power of Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States; and for other reasons not necessary for present purpose to be set forth.\n A justice of the Supreme Judicial Court sustained a demurrer to the petition. On appeal, this was affirmed by the full court, and the petition dismissed. (Mass.) 163 N. E. 75. That court, through its Chief Justice, delivered a carefully drawn opinion, reviewing numerous decisions of this court bearing upon the question involved. The tax was held to be not a tax on income, but an excise 'with respect to the carrying on or doing of business,' as the statute itself in form declares. While it was plain that the tax was larger than it would have been if the income from the tax- exempt securities had not been added to the other items in making up the factor of 'net income,' the court held that the income was not taxed, but simply employed together with the other items in ascertaining the measure for computing the excise.\n The words of the act and the opinion of the state court as to the nature of the tax are to be given consideration and weight; but they are not conclusive. As it many times has been decided neither state courts nor Legislatures, by giving the tax a particular name, or by using some form of words, can take away our duty to consider its nature and effect. Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292, 298\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 626]\n\u00a0\n Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S. Ct. 638. And this court must determine for itself by independent inquiry whether the tax here is what, in form and by the decision of the state court, it is declared to be, namely, an excise tax on the privilege of doing business, or, under the guise of that designation, is in substance and reality a tax on the income derived from tax-exempt securities. If by varying the form-that is to say, if, by using one name for a tax instead of another, or imposing a tax in terms upon one subject when another is in reality aimed at-the substance and effect of the imposition may be changed, constitutional limitations upon powers of taxation would come to naught. The rule is otherwise. To this effect, the following cases may be cited as illustrative:\n A tax laid in terms on the occupation of an importer is in effect a tax on imports. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444 (6 L. Ed. 678). Answering the contention that a state may tax an occupation, and that this tax was nothing more, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'It is impossible to conceal from ourselves, that this is varying the form, without varying the substance. It is treating a prohibition, which is general, as if it were confined to a particular mode of doing the forbidden thing. All must perceive, that a tax on the sale of an article, imported only for sale, is a tax on the article itself . ... So, a tax on the occupation of an importer is, in like manner, a tax on importation. It must add to the price of the article, and be paid by the consumer, or by the importer himself, in like manner as a direct duty on the article itself would be made. This the state has not a right to do, because it is prohibited by the Constitution.'\n\n A tax on the income of an office is a tax on the office itself, and cannot be laid in that form if the office be exempt. Dobbins v. Erie County, 16 Pet. 435. \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 627]\n\u00a0\n A tax on sales made by an auctioneer is a tax on the goods sold, and, where such goods are imported and sold for the importer, the law authorizing the tax is void as imposing a duty on imports. Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n\u00a0\n\n\n A stamp tax upon a bill of lading is in substance and effect a tax upon the thing transported, because of its necessary association with the shipment. Almy v. California, 24 How. 169, 174. And see Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 138.\n In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522, 530\n, 36 S. Ct. 453, a tax upon oil leases of lands of Indians under the protection of the federal government, made by authority of such government, was held void as being in fact a tax upon the power to make the leases and capable of being used to destroy such power. It was said that since the lessees were federal instrumentalities the state could not tax their interest in the leases either directly or as they were represented by the capital stock of the corporations owning them. 'A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them. If they cannot be taxed as entities they cannot be taxed vicariously by taxing the stock, whose only value is their value, or by taking the stock as an evidence or measure of their value, rather than by directly estimating them as the board of equalization and the referee did.'\n In Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S. Ct. 385, 29 A. L. R. 1, this court condemned, as beyond the constitutional power of the state, a statute subjecting mortgages executed to a Federal Land Bank to the payment of a recording tax, as being in effect a tax upon the mortgages.\n It is not necessary to extend the list of cases of like effect. \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 628]\n\u00a0\n The court below predicates its decision upon a series of decisions, of which Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 163-165, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, is the extreme example, holding that a tax lawfully imposed upon the exercise of corporate privileges within the taxing power may be measured by income from the property of the corporation although a part of such income is derived from nontaxable property. See, also, Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593; Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611. The distinction pointed out in these cases is between an attempt to tax the property or income as such and to measure a legitimate tax upon the privileges involved in the use thereof. It is implicit in all that the thing taxed in form was in fact and reality the subject aimed at, and that any burden put upon the nontaxable subject by its use as a measure of value was fortuitous and incidental.\n The aphorism of Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 (4 L. Ed. 579), that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy,' has frequently been reiterated by this court. The principle, of course, is important only where the tax is sought to be imposed upon a nontaxable subject; or, as said in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 60\n, 20 S. Ct. 747, 755 (44 L. Ed. 969), '... the power to destroy which may be the consequence of taxation is a reason why the right to tax should be confined to subjects which may be lawfully embraced therein, even although it happens that in some particular instance no great harm may be caused by the exercise of the taxing authority as to a subject which is beyond its scope.' Not only may the power to tax be exercised oppressively, but for one government-state or national-to lay a tax upon the instrumentalities or securities of the other is derogatory to the latter's dignity, subversive of its powers, and repugnant to its paramount authority. See California v. Central P. R. Co., 127 \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 629]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 1, 41, 8 S. Ct. 1073 (32 L. Ed. 150). These constitute special and compelling reasons why courts, in scrutinizing taxing acts like that here involved, should be acute to distinguish between an exaction which in substance and reality is what it pretends to be, and a scheme to lay a tax upon a nontaxable subject by a deceptive use of words. The fact that a tax ostensibly laid upon a taxable subject is to be measured by the value of a nontaxable subject at once suggests the probability that it was the latter rather than the former that the law-maker sought to reach. If inquiry discloses persuasive grounds for the conclusion that such is the real purpose and effect of the legislation, the tax cannot be upheld without subverting the well-established rule that '... what cannot be done directly because of constitutional restriction cannot be accomplished indirectly by legislation which accomplishes the same result. ... Constitutional provisions, whether operating by way of grant or limitation, are to be enforced according to their letter and spirit, and cannot be evaded by any legislation which, though not in terms trespassing on the letter, yet in substance and effect destroy the grant or limitation.' Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 300 S., 21 S. Ct. 648, 653 (45 L. Ed. 862).\n In the consideration of such legislation, the controlling principle, constantly to be borne in mind, is that the state cannot tax the instrumentalities or bonds of the United States, or, what is the same thing, the income derived therefrom, directly or indirectly-that is to say, it cannot tax them in any form. Words which, literally considered, import a tax upon something else-a tax, for example, as here, upon the privilege of doing business measured in part by the amount of nontaxable interest received-may, nevertheless, be adjudged to lay a tax upon the interest, if that purpose be fairly inferable from a consideration of the history, the surrounding circumstances, or the statute itself considered in all its parts. See Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 521 S., 27 S. Ct. 571 (51 L. Ed. 901). \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 630]\n\u00a0\n On the one hand, the state is at liberty to tax a corporation with respect to the doing of its business. On the other hand, the state cannot tax the income of the corporation derived from nontaxable securities. It necessarily follows that the Legislature may not, by an artful use of words, deprive this court of its authority to look beyond the words to the real legislative purpose. And the power and the duty of the court to do so is of great practical importance. For when the aim of the Legislature is simply to tax the former, it is less likely to impose an injurious burden upon the latter than when the aim is directed primarily against the latter. See Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Texas, supra, page 227 of 210 U. S. (28 S. Ct. 638).\n In Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, this court had occasion to consider a question quite analogous to that here involved. In that case the state statute exempted the income from bonds of the United Stated held by corporations, but provided for taxing so much of the stockholders' dividends as corresponded by the income of the corporation not assessed. This court, holding the tax invalid, said ( page 715 (47 S. Ct. 280)):\n'It is a familiar principle that conduct which in usual situations the law protects may become unlawful when part of a scheme to reach a prohibited result. If the avowed purpose or self-evident operation of a statute is to follow the bonds of the United States and to make up for its inability to reach them directly by indirectly achieving the same result, the statute must fail even if but for its purpose or special operation it would be perfectly good. Under the laws of Wisconsin the income from the United States bonds may not be the only item exempted from the income tax on corporations, but it certainly is the most conspicuous instance of exemption at the present time. A result intelligently foreseen and offering the most obvious motive for an act that will bring it about, fairly may be taken to have been a purpose of the act. On that \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 631]\n\u00a0\n assumption the immunity of the national bonds is too important to allow any narrowing beyond what the acts of Congress permit. We think it would be going too far to say that they allow an intentional interference that is only prevented from being direct by the artificial distinction between a corporation and its members. A tax very well may be upheld as against any casual effect it may have upon the bonds of the United States when passed with a different intent and not aimed at them, but it becomes a more serious attack upon their immunity when they are its obvious aim. In such a case the court must consider the public welfare rather than the artifices contrived for private convenience and must look at the facts.'\n\n See, also, Northwestern Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55; Alpha Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203, 218\n, 45 S. Ct. 477, 44 A. L. R. 1219; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 494\n, 495 S., 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508, 519\n, 48 S. Ct. 591.\n A liberal application of the foregoing principles, which find confirmation especially in the later decisions of this court, is essential to the preservation of the constitutional limitations imposed upon the taxing power of the states. Let it once be conceded that such limitations may be evaded by the adoption of a delusive name to characterize the tax or form of words to describe it, and the destruction of the vitality of these necessary safeguards will soon follow.\n In the present case it appears that the original statute exempted from consideration as a part of the measure of the tax all interest upon the nontaxable securities. The amended act now in force has the effect of repealing this original provision and imposing a burden upon the securities from which, by express language, they had theretofore been free. This was a distinct change of policy on the part of the commonwealth, adopted, as though it had been so declared in precise words, for the very purpose of subjecting these securities pro tanto to the burden of \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 632]\n\u00a0\n the tax. This conclusion is confirmed, if that be necessary, by the report of the special commission appointed by the Legislature to investigate the subject of taxation of banking institutions, Mass. 1925 House Documents, No. 233, from which we quote:\n'Further, the commission addressed itself to the question of what might properly be considered as 'net income' for the purposes of this proposed tax. The national banks and trust companies in their returns to the federal government and to the state under the 12 1\/2 per cent. income tax law are allowed certain deductions of income from specified types of securities in addition to the expense of conducting their business, bad debts, losses, etc. The business corporations, also, are allowed the same deductions. In the opinion of the commission there is no valid reason why, for purposes of this tax, such income exemption should be allowed. Corporations differ from the individual. Business corporations hold tax exempt securities generally, not because they fit into the purpose of their organization, but for the bearing they may have upon tax payments.\n\n'The commission believes that the income upon which this tax should be laid, so far as national banks are concerned, should be the total net income from whatever source, after the proper deductions have been made for the cost of doing business and losses. So far as relates to the business corporations, the same should be the case in respect to the 2 1\/2 per cent. part of the excise measure based on net income.\n\n'It is true that this extension of 'net income' for the purpose of this tax would increase the tax which business corporations now pay, but the commission after investigation believes that such increased tax would be relatively small. Many corporations invested in Liberty Bonds and other government securities during the war for patriotic reasons, which practice, so far as business corporations are \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 633]\n\u00a0\n concerned, is not generally prevalent at present, and the commission believes will not exist in the future to any appreciable extent. So that it is its opinion that such, if any, increased burden upon business corporations will not be appreciable.\n\n'In respect to national banks and trust companies the situation is somewhat different. Considerable in amount of the assets or surplus funds of financial institutions are invested from time to time in securities now exempt from taxation either under federal or state law. The income of banking institutions from these sources is relatively much greater than that of other corporations. In endeavoring to reach a basis for a fair and equitable tax on national banks the commission, as previously stated in this report, was limited to the methods permitted under section 5219 of the United States Revised Statutes. A tax in the nature of an excise tax upon the income of the bank is an equitable and proper tax. ...'\n\n This report received the consideration of the Legislature and, it is fair to suppose, constituted the basis for adopting the amendment here assailed. The effect of the report is that nontaxable bonds nevertheless should be subjected to the burden of the tax; and since that could not be imposed directly, the clear intimation is that it be imposed indirectly through the medium of the so-called 'excise.'\n It has been suggested that the object of the change was to conform the taxation of business corporations to that authorized by Congress for the taxation of national banks. Whether under recent federal statutes, states are authorized to impose a tax upon the income from United States bonds held by national banks, we need not stop to inquire. Certainly there is no statute of the United States which undertakes to authorize a state to impose a tax upon such bonds held by other kinds of corporations. And what power Congress has under the Constitution in respect of such authorization we need not now determine. \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 634]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that authority, even if given, to impose a tax on federal bonds in the case of national banks does not include, by implication or otherwise, the authority to impose a tax upon such bonds held by ordinary corporations.\n It is also suggested in that connection that the amendment in question is necessary, and that its real object was to avoid discrimination forbidden by federal statutes against national banks. But it is enough to say that if such discrimination would otherwise result it must be avoided by some method which does not involve the imposition of a tax which uniformly for a century has been condemned by this court as unconstitutional. The state may not save itself from infringing an act of Congress by violating the Constitution.\n We conclude that the amended act in substance and effect imposes a tax upon federal bonds and securities; and it necessarily follows that the act in substance and effect also imposes a tax upon the county and municipal bonds. In both respects, the act is void. As to the former, the act is in derogation of the constitutional power of Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States, as well as in violation of the acts of Congress declaring such bonds and securities to be nontaxable; and, as to the latter, the act impairs the obligation of the statutory contract of the state by which such bonds were made exempt from state taxation.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n Petitioner is a corporation of the state of Massachusetts. Its very existence and the conduct of its business in corporate form are privileges conferred by the state, which, under the Constitution, it may tax. Under the Constitution of Massachusetts the present tax can be up \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 635]\n\u00a0\n held only if an excise and it and its predecessors have been consistently sustained as excises. S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co. v. Commonwealth, 212 Mass. 35, 37, 98 N. E. 1056, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 805; President, etc., of Portland Bank v. Apthorp, 12 Mass. 252; Commonwealth v. Provident Institution, 12 Allen (94 Mass.) 312; Commonwealth v. Hamilton Mfg. Co., 12 Allen (94 Mass.) 298, 306; Eaton, Crane & Pike Co. v. Commonwealth, 237 Mass. 523, 527, 130 N. E. 99; Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Commonwealth, 244 Mass. 547, 139 N. E. 158. This interpretation of the nature of the exaction has been repeatedly approved by this court. Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; Hamilton Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; cf. Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 84\n, 34 S. Ct. 15; National Leather Co. v.

It is imposed 'with respect to the carrying on or doing business,' and is collectible only when the corporation has in fact been so engaged during the taxable year. See Fore River Shipbuilding Corp. v. Commonwealth, 248 Mass. 137, 140, 142 N. E. 812; Attorney General v. Boston & Albany R. R. Co., 233 Mass. 460, 124 N. E. 257. It is measured by the value of the corporate assets (with appropriate deductions for machinery and real estate otherwise taxed) and by net income earned within the state, which this court has often said are fair measures of the exercise of the corporate franchise. The tax is not measured by gross income, as in Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55, where the validity of an excise measured by net income was recognized. The distinction between net income and gross as the measure of a tax is well established. Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432. Compare Crew-Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S. Ct. 126; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748. Being on net income, the tax does not vary in exact proportion to the gross income from the tax-exempt securities included in the aggregate. \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 636]\n\u00a0\n There is no constitutional principle and no decision of this court, of which I am aware, which would deny to the state the power so to tax the privileges which it has conferred upon petitioner, even though all its property were tax-exempt securities of the United States and income derived from them. For 70 years this court has consistently adhered to the principle that either the federal or state governments may constitutionally impose an excise tax on corporations for the privilege of doing business in corporate form, and measure the tax by the property or net income of the corporation, including the tax-exempt securities of the other or income derived from them. Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, supra; Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Hamilton Co. v. Massachusetts, supra; Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 162-165, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., a federal tax on corporations 'with respect to carrying on or doing business,' measured by net income, was held to be an excise, not a direct tax on property or income, and so was valid, although not apportioned under article 1,  2, cl. 3, and section 9, cl. 4, of the Constitution, and notwithstanding the fact that net income from tax exempt municipal bonds was included in the measure of the tax. In no technical sense does this tax seem open to objection. Being an excise, the tax is not one on property or income, and may include either in its measurement, although not directly taxable.\n Upon like principle a state inheritance tax may be measured by including the value of United States bonds of the decedent. Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 829; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. Compare Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 \nU.S. 384\n, 42 S. Ct. 324. Similarly an excise on a corporation may be measured by its outstanding capital stock, International Shoe Co. v. Shartel (No. 579, October Term, 1928) \n279 U.S. 429\n. 49 S. Ct. 380, 73 L. Ed. -; Hump Hair- \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 637]\n\u00a0\n pin Co. v. Emmerson, \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 305; or by its net income, Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 41 S. Ct. 45; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, supra, even though a part of its capital is used in, or some of its income is derived from, interstate commerce.\n It would seem that only considerations of public policy of weight, which appear to be here wholly wanting, would justify overturning a principle so long established. It has survived a great war, financed by the sale of government obligations, and it has never even been suggested that in any practical way it has impaired either the dignity or credit of the national government.\n I suppose a certain advantage would be enjoyed by a corporation, if the exercise of its corporate franchise in the purchase and use of securities of one government could not be taxed by the other. Theoretically the advantage would inure to each government in the marketing of its securities, just as would be the case if such securities of the taxpayer could not be seized and sold for the payment of any taxes lawfully levied by the state or national government. But the advantage of the one would be gained only at the expense of the other, and it would seem that neither immunity could be claimed under any reasonably practical application of the rule that government instrumentalities may not be taxed. In a broad sense, the taxing power of neither state nor national government can be exercised without having some effect on the other, and there are many points at which the exercise of the undoubted power of one affects the other; but 'the limitation upon the taxing power of each, so far as it affects the other, must receive a practical construction which permits both to function with a minimum of interference each with the other; and that limitation cannot be so varied or extended as seriously to impair either the taxing power of the gov- \n\n[279 U.S. 620, 638]\n\u00a0\n ernment imposing the tax ... or the appropriate exercise of the functions of the government affected by it.' See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 46 S. Ct. 172 (70 L. Ed. 384).\n Granted that a statute otherwise valid may be deemed improper, when intended as a covert means of directly burdening ownership of securities of the other sovereignty (see Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280), I can discern no such sinister purpose in the present legislation. It was, of course, the intention of the Massachusetts Legislature, in the amendment of section 30, to deal specifically, not alone with federal bonds, but with the tax-exempt securities of the commonwealth and its municipalities, by including them in the measure of the excise tax. The amendment did not aim at securities of the national government, or discriminate against them. It was obviously designed to impose on corporations generally a tax similar to the excise on national banks, measured by net income, recommended by the legislative committee as a means of avoiding a then existing discrimination. The inclusion in the measure of the tax of income from all tax-exempt securities tended only to effect this purpose, a similar computation of net income being contemplated for national banks. But in neither case is there anything to suggest that the Legislature intended to impose a direct tax on income or do more than to impose an excise tax, measured by income, including that upon federal bonds, which this court has declared it may do. Its purpose was to prevent the evasion by corporations of payment of the tax which the commonwealth had fixed as the price of the privilege of doing business within it in corporate form, by any course of investment of their funds in tax exempt securities, state or national. As this seems to me to be a permissible purpose, both on principle and by authority, I think the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANLEY v. STATE OF GEORGIA(1929)\nNo. 429\nArgued: December 4, 1928Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n Messrs. Marion Smith, W. T. Colquitt, and Arthur Gray Powell, all of Atlanta, Ga., for appellant. \n\n[279 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Reuben R. Arnold, of Atlanta, Ga., for the State of Georgia.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant was convicted in the superior court of Fulton county, Georgia, of a violation of section 28, art. 20, of the state Banking Act of 1919 (Acts Ga. 1919, p. 219). The judgment was affirmed in the highest court of the state. 166 Ga. 563, 144 S. E. 170. Appellant challenged the validity of that section on the ground, among others, that the presumption created by it is so unreasonable and arbitrary as to amount to a denial of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. His contentions were overruled by both courts, and that question is here for decision. Section 237(a), Judicial Code (28 USCA  344).\n The questioned section follows: 'Every insolvency of a bank shall be deemed fraudulent, and the president and \n\n[279 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n directors shall be severally punished by imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for not less than one (1) year nor longer than ten (10) years; provided, that the defendant in a case arising under this section, may repel the presumption of fraud by showing that the affairs of the bank have been fairly and legally administered, and generally, with the same care and diligence that agents receiving a commission for their services are required and bound by law to observe; and upon such showing the jury shall acquit the prisoner.'\n This section is in words substantially the same as one first found in the Georgia Penal Code of 1833. But its meaning has been changed by a recent statutory definition of insolvency. Section 5, art. 1, Banking Act of 1919, declares: 'A bank shall be deemed to be insolvent, first, when it cannot meet its liabilities as they become due in the regular course of business; second, when the actual cash market value of its assets is insufficient to pay its liabilities to depositors and other creditors; third, when its reserve shall fall under the amount herein required and it shall fail to make good such reserve within thirty (30) days after being required to do so by the superintendent of banks.' Prior to its enactment, none of the conditions specified was deemed insolvency. Griffin v. State, 142 Ga. 636, 642, et seq., 83 S. E. 540, L. R. A. 1915C, 716, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 80.\n Construing section 28, after this enlargement of the meaning of insolvency, the state court, in Snead v. State (1927) 165 Ga. 44, 139 S. E. 812, held that, upon proof of insolvency, it is presumed to be fraudulent, and an accused president or director is presumed to be guilty. The court said at pages 53, 55, of 165 Ga. (139 S. E. 817), that this 'is but an application to a criminal case of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, often applied in civil proceedings. ... The state is only required to prove that the bank was under the management and control of the accused, and that it became insolvent while it was within the management and control of the defendant either by \n\n[279 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n himself alone or conjointly with associates in its management.'\n The indictment in the case at bar merely alleges that at a time and place specified appellant, being president of a bank named and he and two others being directors of said bank 'and the said accused being by law then and there charged with the fair and legal administration of the business and affairs of the said' bank 'then and there pending and during the said official charge and responsibility of the said accused, the said' bank 'did become fraudulently insolvent, contrary,' etc.\n Referring to the language of the section, the court in this case declared that the affairs of a bank are 'fairly and legally' administered when they are administered 'honestly' and 'in accordance with law.' And it said, at pages 578, 579, of 166 Ga. (144 S. E. 178), that the presumption that the insolvency is fraudulent 'places upon these officers the burden of showing that they administered the affairs of the bank with the same care and diligence that agents receiving a commission for their services are required and bound by law to observe. ... In addition, this statute ... permits the accused to rebut the presumption against him, ... by showing other facts, such as that the insolvency was caused by an unexpected panic in the country, or by the speculation of some officer or agent for which the accused was in no way responsible, or by any other facts rebutting the presumption of fraudulent conduct on his part.' The proviso permits the presumption that a crime has been committed to be repelled by the showing specified therein; and, under the decisions of the court, the accused may show any facts that tend to rebut the presumption that he is guilty of the offense charged.\n State legislation declaring that proof of one fact or a group of facts shall constitute prima facie evidence of the main or ultimate fact in issue is valid if there is a rational connection between what is proved and what is to be in- \n\n[279 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n ferred. If the presumption is not unreasonable and is not made conclusive of the rights of the person against whom raised, it does not constitute a denial of due process of law. Mobile, J. & K. C. R. R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463. A prima facie presumption casts upon the person against whom it is applied the duty of going forward with his evidence on the particular point to which the presumption relates. A statute creating a presumption that is arbitrary or that operates to deny a fair opportunity to repel it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 219\n, 233 et seq., 31 S. Ct. 145. Mere legislative flat may not take the place of fact in the determination of issues involving life, liberty or property. 'It is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.' McFarland v. American Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 36 S. Ct. 498, 501 (60 L. Ed. 899).\n The presumption here involved does not rest upon any definite basis. It is raised upon proof of any one or more of the conditions described as insolvency and without regard to the facts from which such condition resulted. The statute does not specify the elements of the offense; and so the inference is not restricted to any particular point or specific issue. The facts so to be presumed are as uncertain and vague as the terms 'fraudulent' and 'fraud' contrasted with 'fairly,' 'legally,' 'honestly,' and 'in accordance with law,' when used to describe the management of a bank. Connally v. General Construction Co., 26. U. S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126. Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., \n274 \nU.S. 445, 454\n, 47 S. Ct. 681. Nor is the generality of the presumption aided by the allegations of the accusation. The indictment merely follows the general words of the statute without specifying facts to disclose the nature or circumstances of the charge. Snead v. State, supra, 165 Ga. 54, 139 S. E. 812. And see United States v. Cruikshan, \n92 U.S. 542\n, 562. And as to guilt, also, the presumption is sweeping. It extends \n\n[279 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n to all directors. There may be from 3 to 25. The president is required to be a director.\n The presumption extends to the corpus delicti, as well as to the responsibility of the president or director accused. The proof which makes a prima facie case points to no specific transaction, matter or thing as the cause of the fraudulent insolvency or to any act or omission of the accused tending to show his responsibility. He is to be convicted unless he negatives every fact, whether act or omission in the management of the bank, from which fraudulent insolvency might result, or shows that he is in no way responsible for the condition of the bank.\n Inference of crime and guilt may not reasonably be drawn from mere inability to pay demand deposits and other debts as they mature. In Goergia banks are permitted to lend up to 85 per cent. of their deposits. Unforeseen demands in excess of the reserves required do not tend to show that the crime created by section 28 has been committed. The same may be said as to the other conditions defined as insolvency. The connection between the fact proved and that presumed is not sufficient. Reasoning does not lead from one to the other. Hawes v. Georgia, \n258 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 42 S. Ct. 204. The presumption created by section 28 is unreasonable and arbitrary. Bailey v. Alabama, supra; McFarland v. American Sugar Co., supra.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARYLAND CASUALTY CO. v. JONES(1929)\nNo. 524\nArgued: April 18, 1929Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 792, 793]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roszel C. Thomsen and Walter L. Clark, both of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Mr. Nat Schmulowitz, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent brought an action at law against the petitioner in a superior court of California, to recover upon an indemnity bond. The case was removed to the federal \n\n[279 U.S. 792, 794]\n\u00a0\n District Court; and was there tried by the court, without the intervention of a jury, which was duly waived by a written stipulation of the parties. Rev. Stat.  649 (28 USCA  773). The District Court made special findings of fact on which it gave judgment against the defendant. Upon a writ of error this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 27 F.(2d) 521. The case is here for limited review, on the question whether that court erred in failing to review the rulings of the District Court in the progress of the trial, excepted to at the time and duly presented by a bill of exceptions. \n278 \nU.S. 596\n, 49 S. Ct. 96, 73 L. Ed. -.\n In the progress of the trial the court made various rulings adverse to the defendant in respect to the admission and exclusion of evidence; denied a motion for nonsuit made by the defendant at the close of the evidence, based on the asserted lack of evidence as to various matters essential to a recovery on the bond; and referred the case to a special master to take further testimony and state an account. To each of these rulings the defendant excepted at the time; and all of these exceptions were duly presented by a bill of exceptions.\n After the coming in of the report of the special master the court made special findings of fact, upon which it entered judgment against the defendant. There was no exception to these findings; nor any request for different findings.\n In connection with the writ of error the defendant filed twenty-one assignments of error. Some of these were directed to special findings made by the court, and others were specifically directed to the rulings of the court on the admission and rejection of evidence, the denial of the motion for nonsuit, and the reference to the special master.\n Despite the fact that all of these assignments of error appeared in the record, the Circuit Court of Appeals stated in its opinion that 'all the assignments of error are based \n\n[279 U.S. 792, 795]\n\u00a0\n upon the insufficiency of the testimony to support the special findings,' and-after stating that on the record presented the court could not consider the sufficiency of the testimony to support the special findings, and that it was not contended that the findings were in themselves insufficient to support the judgment-affirmed the judgment of the District Court, without referring to or considering the assignments of error relating to the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial.\n\n 1. \nUpon the record in this case the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals appears to have been erroneous. Section 700, Rev. Stats. (28 USCA  875), specifically provides that when an issue of fact in a civil cause is found and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury, according to section 649, 'the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial of the cause, if excepted to at the time and duly presented by a bill of exceptions, may be reviewed.' The right granted by the statute to a review of the rulings made during the progress of the trial, is not lost because of the fact that a general finding or special findings sufficient apparently to support the judgment are thereafter made by the court. See Fleischmann Const. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 356 S., 46 S. Ct. 284; Lewellyn v. Elec. Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 48 S. Ct. 63.\n Here the rulings of the court to which the defendant excepted and as to which it assigned errors, plainly related to matters of law. The motion for nonsuit-which corresponded to a motion for a directed verdict- presented the question whether the evidence, with every inference of fact that might be drawn from it in favor of the plaintiff, was sufficient in matter of law to sustain a judgment. See Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman's Palace Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 24, 38\n, 11 S. Ct. 478. This presented a question of law which is reviewable-just as a motion by the plaintiff at the close of a trial without the intervention of a jury, for a declaration \n\n[279 U.S. 792, 796]\n\u00a0\n that he is entitled to judgment, presents a question of law which is reviewable by the appellate court.

A.) 10 F.(2d) 127, 128; Sartoris v. Utah Construction Co. (C C. A.). 21 F.(2d) 1, 2. The statement made in Humphreys v. Third National Bank (C. C. A.) 75 F. 852, 855, quoted in Fleischmann Co. v. United States, supra, page 356 of 270 U. S. (46 S. Ct. 287), on which the plaintiff relies, has, plainly, no reference to the review of a ruling made in the progress of a trial as to such a question of law, but relates merely to the mode of presenting for review the conclusions of law involved in special findings.\n\n 2. \nIt is urged that the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in stating that the assignments of error related only to the special findings and in failing to consider the assignments relating to the rulings of the court during the trial, is to be explained by the fact that all the assignments of error except those relating to the special findings had been waived, under the rules of the court, by the failure of the defendant to set them forth in the specifications of error contained in its brief. And for the purpose of determining this question we are asked to examine a copy of the defendant's brief in the Circuit Court of Appeals which has been tendered as an exhibit to the plaintiff's brief in this Court. This is not a part of the record and cannot be looked to by us. The record, to whose consideration we are limited, discloses no waiver of any of the assignments of error that had been filed. Nor does the court in its opinion refer to any waiver as a reason for not considering the assignments.\n\n 3. \nSince on the face of the record the failure of the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the assignments of error relating to rulings at the hearing is unexplained, and its action appears to have been erroneous, its judgment must be reversed. And the case will be remanded to that \n\n[279 U.S. 792, 797]\n\u00a0\n court, with instructions to consider the several assignments of error relating to the rulings of the trial court in the progress of the trial, and-unless they have been waived-take further proceedings in regard thereto.

Gutte, of San Juan, Porto Rico, for the United States.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 12, 18]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a British subject, was born in Nova Scotia in 1877. He lawfully entered the United States at New \n\n[279 U.S. 12, 19]\n\u00a0\n York, September 17, 1920. He immediately established and has since maintained a place of residence at or near Boston, Mass., where his wife and child joined him September 1, 1921, and have since lived. Since his entry he has continuously served as a master of a vessel of British registry belonging to the United Fruit Company, a New Jersey corporation, plying between Boston and Central American countries. November 30, 1921, he filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen in the District Court for Massachusetts and December 22, 1926, his petition for naturalization. That court denied his application, and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 22 F.(2d) 747. There is conflict between that decision and one of the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit. United States v. Nicolich, 25 F.(2d) 245. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n278 \nU.S. 581\n, 48 S. Ct. 562.\n The sole question is whether service on a vessel of foreign registry is to be considered residence in the United States for naturalization purposes.\n The fourth subdivision of section 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 598, provides that on the petition of an alien for citizenship it shall be made to appear 'that immediately preceding the date of his application he has resided continuously within the United States five years at least.' U. S. C. tit. 8,  382 (8 USCA  382).\n That act was amended May 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 542, by adding to section 4 seven subdivisions. The seventh subdivision, being the first of those so added, is here involved, and so far as material, its substance is indicated in the margin. \n1\n It contains the following:\n'Provided further, \n\n[279 U.S. 12, 20]\n\u00a0\n 'that service by aliens upon vessels other than of American registry whether continuous or broken, shall not be considered as residence for naturalization purposes within the jurisdiction of the United States, and such aliens can not secure residence for naturalization purposes during service upon vessels of foreign registry.' U. S. C. tit. 8,  384 (8 USCA  384).\n\n If that provision relates only to those classified in the added subdivision, petitioner is entitled to naturalization; but if it is given general application the judgment below is right.\n As a general rule, a proviso is intended to take a special case or class of cases out of the operation of the body of \n\n[279 U.S. 12, 21]\n\u00a0\n the section in which it is found. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 30; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165; Ryan v. Carter, \n93 U.S. 78\n, 83; United States v. McElvain, \n272 \nU.S. 633, 635\n, 47 S. Ct. 219. But a proviso is not always limited in its effect to the part of the enactment with which it is immediately associated; it may apply generally to all cases within the meaning of the language used. United States v. Babbit, 1 Black, 55. Springer v. Philippine Islands, \n277 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 48 S. Ct. 480. Little if any significance is to be given to the use of the word 'provided.' in \n\n[279 U.S. 12, 22]\n\u00a0\n Acts of Congress, that word is employed for many purposes. Schlemmer v. Buffalo, Rochester, etc., Ry., \n205 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 27 S. Ct. 407. Sometimes it is used merely to safeguard against misinterpretation or to distinguish different paragraphs or sentences. Georgia Banking Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 9 S. Ct. 47. For the proper construction of the provision in question, consideration need not be limited to the subdivision in which it is found; the general purpose of the section may be taken into account. United States v. Whitridge, \n197 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 25 S. Ct. 406.\n The general rule in respect of residence of aliens seeking naturalization was established by section 4 of the act of 1906. The subdivision added by the amendatory act takes out of that rule four classes, which include (1) native-born Filipino declarants having served in the Navy, Marine Corps or Naval Auxiliary; (2) aliens, or Porto Ricans not citizens of the United States, having served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard or on merchant or fishing vessels of the United States; ( 3) aliens in the military or naval service during the war; and (4) alien declarants who have been honorably discharged from the Army, Navy or Philippine Constabulary and have been accepted for military or naval service on condition that they naturalize. As to those included in the first three classes, no proof of residence is required. As to members of the fourth class, three years' residence is required. Provisions regulating procedure in cases covered by the subdivision follow. After these are the clauses designated in the margin, 5, 6, and 7, followed by the proviso above quoted.\n Petitioner contends and it may be assumed that, under the act of 1906 before the amendment, mere absence of a sailor in pursuit of his calling whether serving on vessels of United States or of foreign registry did not interrupt the required period of residence in the case of one maintaining a domicile in this country. United States v. Rockteschell (C. C. A.) \n\n[279 U.S. 12, 23]\n\u00a0\n 208 F. 530. United States v. Habbick (D. C.) 287 F. 593, 595.\n The amendatory act was passed in war time, and the new classes include those who, by reason of service in support of the national purpose, specially merit the protection of our flag and the benefits of citizenship. As to them Congress undoubtedly intended generously to relax the requirements for naturalization. See House Report No. 502, 65th Congress, 2d Session. But petitioner is not within any of the new classes; he claims under the earlier act. And he insists that service on vessels of foreign registration is to be deemed residence for naturalization of aliens domiciled here who are within the five-year rule. But under that construction, such service cannot be considered as residence for those within the favored classes created by the amendment.\n Moreover, there is nothing in the subdivision to which the proviso can reasonably be held to relate. And, if not construed to apply to those who like petitioner are subject to the five-year rule, it would have no effect. This is plainly so because those in the first three classes are not required to prove any period of residence; and the place of their military service is the place of residence required to be established by those belonging to the fourth class.\n The subdivision contains provisions plainly not limited to the special classes created by it. It is manifest without discussion that the clauses numbered 5, 6 and 7 in the margin are intended to have effect beyond the scope of the subdivision. The language and circumstances attending the enactment of the amendment do not permit a construction of the proviso limiting its effect to the special classes aforesaid. It was intended to apply generally according to its terms and to establish the rule that service on foreign vessels would not be deemed residence within the United States for the purposes of naturalization.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The numbers and other matter within brackets are added for convenience in reading.\n Seventh.

Houts, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Arthur Staal and E. D. Andrews, both of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thomas Doyle, a switchman employed by the Michigan Central Railroad, was killed in Michigan in the performance of his duties. He was then a resident of Lansing in that state, and there his wife Augusta lived with him until his death. Shortly after, she removed to Mossouri, was appointed administratrix of his estate at St. Louis, and, as such, brought in the circuit court of that city an action for damages against the railroad under the Federal Safety Appliance Act (45 USCA  1-46) and the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59). The railroad is a Michigan corporation. No part of its line runs into Missouri. It has not consented to be sued there, has never been admitted to do business there, and has never done any business there, except soliciting freight for transportation in interstate commerce over its lines in other states. For this limited purpose it \n\n[278 U.S. 492, 494]\n\u00a0\n maintains an office at St. Louis. Upon its agent in charge of that office the sheriff made service of the summons.\n The railroad, appearing specially, filed a petition for removal of the cause to the federal court. This the state court denied. Thereupon the railroad filed a transcript of the record in the federal court and moved there to quash the summons. Upon objection of the administrix, that court declined to pass on the motion and remanded the case to the state court. The did so apparently on the ground that the suit was one under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The railroad, again appearing specially, pressed in the state court the motion to quash. It was denied on the authority of State ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. Sale, 232 Mo. 166, 132 S. W. 1119, and Davis v. Jacksonville Southeastern Line, 126 Mo. 69, 28 S. W. 965, which hold that service upon a soliciting freight agent confers jurisdiction and that a petition to remove to the federal court is equivalent to a general appearance. After denial of the motion to quash the summons this application for a writ of prohibition was filed by the railroad, in the highest court of the state, in accordance with what appears to be the appropriate local practice. It prays that the judges of the circuit court be enjoined from acting in the suit commenced by Mrs. Doyle. The application for the writ of prohibition was denied without an opinion. That judgment is final within the meaning of section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344(a). State of Mossouri ex rel. St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200\n, 45 S. Ct. 47, 42 A. L. R. 1232. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n277 \nU.S. 581\n, 48 S. Ct. 562.\n The railroad claims that it was not subject to suit in Missouri, among other reasons, because to maintain it would violate the commerce clause. In order to show that trial of the action for damages in Missouri would entail a heavy burden upon, and unreasonably obstruct, interstate commerce, it set forth facts substantially identical with those held sufficient for that purpose in Davis v. Farmers' \n\n[278 U.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556, and Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S. Ct. 469. From those cases that here involved differs only in this: There, the plaintiff was a nonresident. Here the plaintiff had become a resident in Missouri after the injury complained of, but before instituting the action. For aught that appears, her removal to St. Louis shortly after the accident was solely for the purpose of bringing the suit, and because she was advised that her chances of recovery would be better there than they would be in Michigan. The mere fact that she had acquired a residence within Missouri before commencing the action does not make reasonable the imposition upon interstate commerce of the heavy burden which would be entailed in trying the cause in a state remote from that in which the accident occurred and in which both parties resided at the time.\n The case is unlike others in which the jurisdiction was sustained against a nonresident railroad. In State of Missouri ex rel. St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200\n, 45 S. Ct. 47, 42 A. L. R. 1232, it appeared that the shipment out of which the cause of action arose was of goods deliverable in Missouri, and also that the negligent acts complained of may have occurred within the state. In Hoffman v. Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S. Ct. 485, the railroad was organized under the laws of the state, and operated a part of its line in the county in which the action was brought.\n The contention that filing the petition for removal to the federal court was equivalent to the entry of a general appearance is obviously unsound. General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 268\n, 269 S., 43 S. Ct. 106 (67 L. Ed. 244); Hassler v. Shaw, \n271 \nU.S. 195\n, 46 S. Ct. 479. There is also a suggestion that the motion to quash the summons made by the railroad, in the state court after the remand, operated, under the Missouri practice, as a general appearance, York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15\n, 11 S. Ct. 9, 34 S. Ct. 604; and that this precluded it from objecting to a trial of the cause within that state. We have no occasion \n\n[278 U.S. 492, 496]\n\u00a0\n to inquire into the local practice. The constitutional claim sustained in Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556, was not that under the Fourteenth Amendment as in Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., \n260 \nU.S. 516\n, 43 S. St. 170. It was assumed that the carrier had been found within the state. The judgment was reversed on the ground that to compel it to try the cause there would burden interstate commerce and, hence, would violate the commerce clause. No local rule of practice can prevent the carrier from laying the appropriate foundation for the enforcement of its constitutional right by making a seasonable motion. Compare Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197\n, 35 S. Ct. 57; Yazzo & Mississippi Valley R. R. v. Mullins, \n249 \nU.S. 531\n, 39 S. Ct. 368; Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 44 S. Ct. 13 (68 L.

Henry S. Mitchell and John E. Palmer, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. H. Patterson, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued petitioner in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, U. S. C. tit. 45,  51-59 (45 USCA  51-59), to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him while employed in petitioner's railroad yard at Kolze, in that state. There \n\n[279 U.S. 410, 411]\n\u00a0\n was a verdict for $15,000 in favor of respondent, and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Appellate Court of the First District. Rock v. M., St. P. & S. S. M. R. Co., 247 Ill. App. 600. Petitioner applied to the state Supreme Court to have the case certified to it for review and determination, but the application was denied.\n Respondent asserts that the judgment is not one of the highest court of the state in which a decision in the suit could be had, and that therefore this court has no jurisdiction.\n Paragraph 120, c. 110, Cahill's Revised Statutes of Illinois, the material parts of which are printed in the margin,1 makes judgments of the Appellate Courts final in all cases except those reviewable in the Supreme Court as a matter of right under the state Constitution, those in which a majority of the judges of the Appellate Court make certificates of importance and grant appeals, and those brought up on writ of certiorari issued by the Supreme Court. This case is one in which the Supreme Court may issue writ of certiorari. Kenna v. Calumet, etc., R. Co., \n\n[279 U.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n 206 Ill. App. 17, 44. The statute does not require one seeking review to apply to the judges of the lower court before presenting petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. It is held by the state courts that a denial of petition for certiorari in a case where a certificate of importance has not been granted makes the judgment of the Appellate Court final. While such denial is not an approval of the reasons on which the Appellate Court rests its judgment, it is an approval of the conclusion reached by it, 'and is therefore, in effect, an affirmance of the judgment.' Soden v. Claney, 269 Ill. 98, 102, 109 N. E. 661, 663; People v. Grant, 283 Ill. 391, 397, 119 N. E. 344. It would be unreasonable to require a defeated party to apply to the judges of the lower court for a certificate of importance and appeal after the Supreme Court had so approved the judgment.\n The judgment is reviewable here. 'Whenever the highest court of a state by any form of decision affirms or denies the validity of a judgment of an inferior court, over which it by law can exercise appellate authority, the jurisdiction of this court to review such decision, if it involves a federal question, will, upon a proper proceeding, attach.' Williams v. Bruffy, \n102 U.S. 248\n, 255 (26 L. Ed. 135). And see Gregory v. McVeigh, 23 Wall. 294, 306.\n We come to the merits. Respondent was an imposter. His true name is Joe Rock. He obtained employment and remained at work by means of deception and fraud. October 1, 1923, he applied for employment as a switchman in petitioner's yard at Kolze. In accordance with a rule and the practice of petitioner, respondent was sent to the company's physician for physical examination. It was found that he had been treated surgically for ulcer of the stomach and removal of the appendix, and that at the time of the examination he had a rupture. His application was rejected because of his condition. A few days later, respondent under the name of John Rock, representing that he had not theretofore applied, again made \n\n[279 U.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n application for such employment. Petitioner's superintendent was deceived as to respondent's identity and accepted him, subject to examination to ascertain whether he was physically fit for such work, and sent him to the physician to be examined. Then respondent procured one Lenhart to impersonate him and in his place to submit to the required examination. The physician found Lenhart's condition satisfactory, and believing that he was the applicant, reported favorably on the application. As a result of the deception petitioner gave respondent employment, and it did not learn of the fraud until after December 24, 1924, the date on which respondent was injured.\n We are called upon to decide whether, notwithstanding the means by which he got employment and retained his position, respondent may maintain an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.\n The act abrogates the fellow-servant rule, restricts the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, and extends liability to cases of death. And respondent in this action seeks, in virtue of its provisions and despite the rules of the common law, to hold petitioner liable for negligence of his fellow servants and notwithstanding his own negligence may have contributed to cause his injuries. Since the decision of this court in the Second Employers' liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 51 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44, it has been well understood that the protection of interstate commerce and the safety of those employed therein have direct relation to the public interests which Congress by that act intended to promote. Philadelphia B. & W. R. Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 614\n, 32 S. Ct. 589. Watson v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. (C. C.) 169 F. 942, 950. And see McNamara v. Washington Terminal Co., 37 App. D. C. 384, 393.\n The carriers owe a duty to their patrons as well as to those engaged in the operation of their railroads to take \n\n[279 U.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n care to employ only those who are careful and competent to do the work assigned to them and to exclude the unfit from their service. The enforcement of the act is calculated to stimulate them to proper performance of that duty. Petitioner had a right to require applicants for work on its railroad to pass appropriate physical examinations. Respondent's physical condition was an adequate cause for the rejection of his application. The deception by which he subsequently secured employment set at naught the carrier's reasonable rule and practice established to promote the safety of employees and to protect commerce. It was directly opposed to the public interest, because calculated to embarrass and hinder the carrier in the performance of its duties and to defeat important purposes sought to be advanced by the act.\n The evils and disadvantages likely to flow from such impostures are the same in kind as those which invalidate attempts of common carriers by contract stipulations to escape liability for their own negligence in respect of duties essential to their public calling. In N. Y. C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, an action to recover damages by one injured while being transported on a railroad train in pursuance of an agreement purporting to exempt the carrier from responsibility for the negligence of itself or its employees, the court said (page 377): 'In regulating the public establishment of common carriers, the great object of the law was to secure the utmost care and diligence in the performance of their important duties-an object essential to the welfare of every civilized community. ... It is obvious ... that if a carrier stipulate not to be bound to the exercise of care and diligence, but to be at liberty to indulge in the contrary, he seeks to put off the essential duties of his employment.'\n Respondent's position as employee is essential to his right to recover under the act. He in fact performed the work of a switchman for petitioner, but he was not of right \n\n[279 U.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n its employee, within the meaning of the act. He obtained and held his place through fraudulent means. While his physical condition was not a cause of his injuries, it did have direct relation to the propriety of admitting him to such employment. It was at all times his duty to disclose his identity and physical condition to petitioner. His failure so to do was a continuing wrong in the nature of a cheat. The misrepresentation and injury may not be regarded as unrelated contemporary facts. As a result of his concealment his status was at all times wrongful, a fraud upon the petitioner, and a peril to its patrons and its other employees. Right to recover may not justly or reasonably be rested on a foundation so abhorrent to public policy. N. Y. C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, supra; Great Northern Ry. Co. v.

Holland and George E. Strong, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. James A. Templeton and Robert L. Carlock, both of Fort Worth, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The predecessor of plaintiff in error was the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company of Texas. In 1915, its properties were placed in the hands of a receiver ap- \n\n[278 U.S. 258, 259]\n\u00a0\n pointed by the United States court for the Northern District of Texas. In 1917, defendants in error obtained a judgment in the district court of Dallas county, Texas, against that company and another carrier on a claim for damages to cattle being transported prior to the appointment of the receiver. The judgment was allowed as an unsecured claim. Pursuant to an order of court, the receiver sold the railroad properties subject, among other things, to claims under article 6625 of the 1911 Revised Civil Statutes of Texas (article 6422, 1925 Revision). The purchasers and their associates organized plaintiff in error and transferred to it the railway properties aforesaid, and that company continued to operate them in the service of the public as a common carrier. Defendants in error brought this suit to recover from plaintiff in error the amount remaining unpaid and to have foreclosed a lien therefor which it claimed to have under article 6625 upon the railroad properties so acquired. Plaintiff in error maintained that the state statute is repugnant to Interstate Commerce Act ,  20a, added by Transportation Act 1920,  439 U. S. C. tit. 49 (49 USCA  20a). The district court adjudged defendants in error entitled to recover, held the claim to be within the purview of article 6625 and a lien upon the railroad properties, and decreed foreclosure. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed. The Supreme Court reversed the latter and in all things affirmed the decree of the district court. The case is here under section 237(a), Judicial Code (28 USCA  344(a)).\n The pertinent parts of article 6625 follow: 'In case of a sale of the property and franchises of a railroad company within this State the purchaser ... and associates, ... may form a corporation ... for the purpose of acquiring, owning, maintaining and operating the road so purchased ...; and, when such charter has been filed, the new corporation shall have the powers and privileges then conferred by the laws of this State upon chartered railroads. ... The property and franchises so purchased \n\n[278 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n shall be charged with and subject to the payment of all subsisting liabilities and claims for death and personal injuries ... for loss of and damage to the property sustained in the operation of the railroad by the sold out company ... and for the current expenses of such operation.'\n The provisions of section 20a relied on by plaintiff in error are: Paragraph (2): 'It shall be unlawful for any carrier to issue any share of capital stock or any bond or other evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the carrier (hereinafter in this section collectively termed 'securities') or to assume any obligation or liability ... in respect of the securities of any other person, ... even though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that ... the (Interstate Commerce) Commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption.' Paragraph (7) declares the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be exclusive and plenary. Paragraph ( 11) provides that any security issued or assumed without or contrary to the authorization of the Commission shall be void. It makes the carrier, directors and officers, who participate in such unauthorized issue or assumption liable for the damage sustained by one purchasing any such security without notice, and prescribes penalties for violations.\n Plaintiff in error does not contend that the claim of the defendant in error is not covered by the terms of article 6625, or that, considered without regard to section 20a, it would not be effective to charge the property. The purpose of that article is to subject the property of the railroad to payment of claims of the classes specified and to prevent their defeat by a transfer of the property. And clearly section 20a relates exclusively to securities. It regulates those to be issued by the carrier and its assumption of liability or obligation in respect of those issued by others. And it declares the consequences to follow violations of the re- \n\n[278 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n quirements prescribed. It does not in any manner relate to liability for, or the payment of, claims specified in article 6625. Its field of operation is wholly distinct from that covered by the state enactment.\n It requires no discussion or citation of authority to show that there is no conflict between article 6625 and the provisions of section 20a of the Transportation Act referred to. The contention of plaintiff in error is without merit.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORIMURA, ARAI & CO. v. TABACK(1929)\nNo. 18\nArgued: October 9, 1928Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. James D. Carpenter, Jr., of Jersey City, N. J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frederic M. P. Pearse, of Newark, N. J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1920, Nathan Taback and Louis Taback were adjudged bankrupts, both individually and as part \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n ners trading as Taback Brothers, under an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against them in the District Court for New Jersey. They seasonably applied for discharge. The firm of Morimura, Arai & Co., and objecting creditor, filed specification of opposition on the two grounds, among others: That the bankrupts had obtained property on credit on a materially false statement in writing made by them to the objection creditor for the purpose of obtaining credit; and that with intent to conceal their financial condition they had destroyed, concealed or failed to keep books of account or records from which such condition might be ascertained. Bankruptcy Act,  14b, as amended by section 6 of the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 838, c. 412.1 The issues so raised were referred to the referee, as special master, to take proof and report it to the court, with his findings thereon. 2 He took the proof in 1921 and 1922, and in 1926 reported that in his opinion the bankrupts were entitled to discharge. The District Judge sustained exceptions to this report and ordered that the application for discharge be denied. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this order, with directions to dismiss the exceptions and discharge the bankrupts. 21 F.(2d) 161.\n The Morimura Company relies here on both of the grounds of opposition mentioned above.\n The first of these grounds is predicated on a written statement made to the Morimura Company in January, 1920. This, under section 14b(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1910, required a denial of the discharge, if (a) the bankrupts obtained property on credit from the \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n Morimura Company upon this statement, and (b) the statement was materially false and (c) was made to the Morimura Company for the purpose of obtaining such property on credit. See Gerdes v. Lustgarten, \n266 \nU.S. 321, 323\n, 326 S., 45 S. Ct. 107.\n In the master's report-which is set forth in the margin3-he made no specific findings of fact in reference to the precise issues, but without citing any testimony or giving his reason, stated generally that he believed the statement 'was substantially correct.' The District Judge- after referring to the vagueness and generality of this report-stated that obviously the statement was false and was made for the purpose of obtaining credit. The Circuit Court of Appeals-after referring to the fact that \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n the master saw and heard all the witnesses-without determining whether or not the statement was correct, stated that they were not satisfied that 'a consciously false financial statement was made for the purpose of obtaining credit.'\n As there is no concurrent finding on any of the material issues relating to the written statement, we have examined the evidence at length for the purpose of determining the essential facts.\n Shortly stated, it appears that in 1917 the two Tabacks entered into the business of buying and selling silk as partners under the firm name of Taback Brothers. The capital consisted of borrowed money. The firm carried on business in New York until May 1920, when it moved to New Jersey. The business gradually enlarged, and the firm established a good credit, paying its bills promptly and frequently taking the cash discounts. It began to purchase silk from the Morimura Company in 1919. On a financial statement showing that on July 1 the firm had a net worth of $140,000, the Morimura Company in September extended it a line of credit of $20,000, on terms of sixty days. From that time until January 1, 1920, the firm bought about $150,000 woth of silk from the Morimura Company, and paid all of its bills before maturity. However, during that time Henry Taback, who had charge of this branch of the firm's business, on different occasions, applied, both in person and through the salesman from whom he purchased the silk, to the credit manager of the Morimura Company for an enlargement of the line of credit. This the manager refused until he had a new financial statement on which to base an increase.\n On January 1, 1920, the firm opened a new set of books. An accountant carried forward to the new books the entries from the previous books which showed the status of affairs of the firm on December 31, 1919. The correct- \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n ness of the old books and of the transfer to the new books is not questioned. In the opening entries of the new books the capital of one of the partners was shown as $4,385.93, and that of the other as $7,285.50, making a total capital of $11,671.43.\n From that time until the bankruptcy the new books were used by the firm; and they were introduced in evidence. The old books, which were stored in the office until the firm moved to New Jersey in the following May, were then cast aside and could not be produced in evidence.\n There was introduced in evidence a tabulated statement compiled from the opening entries in the new books, which is set forth in the margin. \n4\n This tabulated statement-the accuracy of which was not questioned-shows that on January 1, 1920, the total assets of the firm, as shown by the new books, were $277,846.48, and the total liabilities $266,175.05, leaving a net worth of $11,671.43-the exact amount of the aggregate capital of the two partners as shown on the books. \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n On January 7, 1920, six days after the new books were opened, Henry Taback furnished the credit manager of the Morimura Company a written statement which he had prepared and signed, purporting to show the assets and liabilities of the firm on December 31, 1919. The manager testified that at that time Henry Taback requested an enlargement of the firm's credit, and that, after questioning Taback as to various items in the statement, he agreed to extend the firm a line of credit of $40,000 on four months' time. This was denied by Henry Taback; and both the bankrupts testified that this statement was made merely to show how they stood, and that they did not then need any credit from the Morimura Company.\n This statement, which is set forth in the margin,5 is utterly irreconcilable with the financial condition of the \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n firm as disclosed by the new books opened on January 1. This appears by a comparison with the tabulated statement compiled from these books. \n6\n The statement of January 7 shows on its face total assets of $372,066.03 as against only $277,846.48 shown by the books; a liability, of only $96,395. 20, by open account, as against total liabilities of $266,175.05 shown by the books; and a net worth of $275,670.83 as against only $11,671.43 shown by the books; that is, the statement of January 7 shows $94,219.55 more of assets and $169,779.85 less of liabilities than those shown by the books; and a net worth of $263,999.40 more than the net worth shown by the books. And, as appears by a detailed comparison between the statement of January 7 and the tabulated statement, every item in the statement of January 7 is materially different from the corresponding item appearing on the books.\n No evidence whatever was offered by the bankrupts to account for the discrepancies between the statement of January 7 and the tabulated statement drawn from the books. There was no effort to show that the firm had on December 31, 1919, any assets that were not shown on the books, or did not owe any of the liabilities shown on \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n the books. While Henry Taback stated generally that the statement of January 7 was correct to the best of his knowledge he testified that the accountants countants who opened the new books had not then reported to him the financial condition appearing on the books; and, being asked where he got his statement, said: 'I sat down in the office on a certain day and I looked up the balance sheets in the bank, both banks, ... and I looked up my stock, and I looked up what we had on contract, and what we have sold to be delivered, January, February and March-we had at that time $100, 000 profits to be made which was sold to good concerns, and I figured my building so much worth, and so I wrote out my profit what it was worth on January 1st, so much for building, and I made up my statement with my own soul. Q. You didn't compare your assets and liabilities with the books? A. I followed my own information of what we had, and my brother came up from New York and I told him what we took up as profits, which was not cashed in yet, but I figured I am worth the money. Q. Where did you get the liabilities from? A. I looked up the unpaid items and I checked up and found out what was paid and unpaid, and that is what I put down, my own figures to my best knowledge. Q. Did you compare them with the items of liabilities as appeared on the books? A. Mr. Putney, as far as I had knowledge of, I tried my best to not give a false statement. Q. Did you look at your books to see? A. I looked at the books to see what was owing to us and to see what we owed, and I took it down to my own best knowledge . ... Q. Did you, when you were making this statement for (the credit manager) look at (the purchase ledger) book in order to get the amount of the debts which you owed? A. No.' And when asked in reference to the fact that the statement of January 7 showed that the liabilities were only $96, 395.20 (by account payable), while the general ledger showed 'notes payable' alone \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n of $109,246.18 on January 1, he said: 'I took it the way I explained before, but I didn't touch the books.'\n Louis Taback, who had charge of the firm's sales and could not read or write, testified that he did not find out that a statement had been given to the Morimura Company until about a day or two afterward when his brother told him he had been up to the Morimura Company and given a statement of how they stood, and that, as he understood, 'my brother looked up the stock and said it was worth between $275,000 and $300,000 . ... He figured up what we took in and what we sold and the mill, and he showed me how much we are worth.'\n On January 10 the firm contracted with the Morimura Company for the purchase of twenty bales of silk at a stipulated price on terms of four months after delivery in February. \n7\n In April the the Morimura Company delivered to the firm the twenty bales called for by the contract, taking in payment two trade acceptances, aggregating $39,536.19, at four months each. The credit manager of the Morimura Company testified that the contract and deliveries were made in reliance upon the statement of January 7.\n In the latter part of January the price of silk began to fall. This finally resulted in a panic in the silk market, and the firm became bankrupt in September. Between January 1 and the bankruptcy it had bought more than $100,000 worth of silk from the Morimura Company in addition to the twenty bales of silk mentioned above, and had also bought a large amount of silk on credit from other dealers. For some time it paid its bills to the Morimura Company before maturity, and at the time of the bankruptcy had paid everything due the Morimura Com- \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n pany except the trade acceptances for $39,536.19 given in April, which were still unpaid.\n Upon the entire evidence we reach the following conclusions:\n\n 1. \nThe undisputed evidence shows that the written statement of January 7 was materially and grossly incorrect, purporting as it did to show that the firm had a net worth of approximately $264,000 more than the actual net worth shown by its books. The opinion of the master that this statement was 'substantially correct'-the only specific finding made in his report-manifestly did not depend upon the weighing of conflicting testimony or the credibility of witnesses. For this reason, if for no other, it does not have the weight ordinarily attaching to the conclusions of a master upon conflicting evidence, as stated in Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 149\n, 8 S. Ct. 894; and it was clearly due to error or mistake.\n\n 2. \nIt is established by the clear weight of the evidence that the written statement-which was made to the Morimura Company by Henry Taback in behalf of the firm and was acquiesced in by Louis Taback-was not only incorrect but materially false within the meaning of section 14b(3) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  32b(3); that is, that it was made and acquiesced in either with actual knowledge that it was incorrect, or with reckless indifference to the actual facts, without examining the available source of knowledge which lay at hand, and with no reasonable ground to believe that it was in fact correct.\n\n 3. \nIt is established by the clear weight of the evidence that this false statement was made to the Morimura Company for the express purpose of obtaining silk on credit, and that upon it silk was in fact obtained from the Morimura Company on credit. Compare Gerdes v. Lustgarten, supra.\n It follows that the specification of opposition based on this written statement should have been sustained, and \n\n[279 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n the bankrupts' application for discharge should have been denied.\n It is not necessary to determine whether the other specification of opposition to the application for discharge, which was predicated upon the books of account or records kept by the firm after January 1, 1920, should also have been sustained, since even if this were the case the result would not be changed.\n The decree will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court, with instructions to enter a decree sustaining the specification of opposition relating to the written statement and denying the bankrupts' application for discharge.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 14b was later amended in material respects by section 6 of the Act of May 27, 1926, 44 Stat. 662, c. 406; 11 USCA  32(b). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] As to such references see generally sections 14 (b) and 38(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  32(b), 66(4); General Order in Bankruptcy No. 12,  3; International Harvester Co. v.

A.) 262 f,. 500. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In this report the master stated: 'I beg leave to report that the objections to the discharge of the bankrupts in this case are predicated largely upon a statement issued by the bankrupts as of December 31st, 1919. The adjudication in this matter was September 29th, 1920, and during the time between the giving of the statement ... and the adjudication, ... the silk business passed through one of the worst periods in its existence, raw silk declining from around $15.00 to $4.50 per pound, and I believe the statement issued by the bankrupts in 1919 was substantially correct. The old books of the bankrupts were apparently destroyed, but the new books, for considerable time prior to the bankruptcy, had been so far as the records show, correctly kept. The bankrupts did obtain property on credit, but not to the extent of the credit that had been extended to them; they bought a large quantity of raw silk on contract, running into the several hundred thousand dollars, which was apparently a gamble between the bankrupts and the creditors as to which one was going to win, and with the exception of a few discrepancies in the books which were afterwards explained, it is my opinion that the said bankrupts have in all things conformed to the requirements of (the Bankruptcy Act of 1898); and that the testimony herein and returned herewith shows that the said bankrupts have committed none of the offenses and done none of the acts prohibited by said Act, and that, in my opinion, the said bankrupts, Nathan Taback and Louis Taback, ind. and as prts, trdg. as Taback Brothers, are entitled to their discharge.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This reads as follows:\n Taback Bros.

SKANDINAVIA INS. CO.(1929)\nNo. 450\nArgued: March 7, 1929Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 405, 406]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Garner Wynn Green, of Jackson, Miss., John M. Lee, of Chicago, Ill., and Marcellus Green, of Jackson, Miss., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Oscar R. Houston, of New York City, and Palmer Pillans, of Mobile, Ala., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In April, 1925, petitioner filed its declaration in the circuit court of Harris county, Mississippi, in an action to recover $50,000 from respondent, a Danish corporation, on an insurance policy. Thereupon the sheriff served a summons upon the state insurance commissioner, and the clerk of the court mailed a copy addressed to respondent at its home office in Copenhagen. There being diversity of citizenship, respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, and filed a motion to quash and plea to the jurisdiction on the ground that respondent was not doing business in the state and had not authorized or consented to \n\n[279 U.S. 405, 407]\n\u00a0\n such service. Issue was joined, there was a trial at which much evidence was heard, the District Court found for respondent, held the service invalid, sustained the plea, and dismissed the case. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 27 F.(2d) 329.\n Petitioner was incorporated under the laws of Louisiana and engaged in the business of packing and shipping meats in the United States and other countries. Respondent was incorporated in Denmark and engaged in the insurance business. Neither of the parties was a resident or citizen of Mississippi; and, as found by both courts, respondent was not doing business in that State. In 1918 at Buenos Aires, Argentina, respondent issued to petitioner the policy on which this action was brought. It covered a shipment of beef belonging to petitioner in a vessel at Montevideo, Uruguay, to be carried to Havana, Cuba. The declaration alleged a total loss and prayed judgment for the full amount of the policy.\n In March, 1923, respondent, conformably to section 5864, Hemingway's Code 1927, appointed the state insurance commissioner its attorney upon whom process might be served. The authorization states that service upon him shall be deemed to be valid personal service upon the company, and that such authority shall continue 'so long as any liability of the company remains outstanding' in Mississippi, whether incurred before or after such appointment. And respondent, in accordance with the same section,1 appointed a resident of the state for trans- \n\n[279 U.S. 405, 408]\n\u00a0\n action of the business of reinsurance therein. It also annually reported such business and paid a license fee. Sections 5866, 5877, 5888. It made a deposit with an officer of the state of New York for the security of its policy holders in the United States and so complied with Mississippi Law. Section 5868\n\n\n Respondent's business in the United States was confined to reinsurance, and all such contracts were made in New York City. Some of the reinsured risks covered property in Mississippi, and that made the above-mentioned appointments necessary in order to comply with the laws of the state. Section 5865.\n Reinsurance involves no transaction or privity between the reinsurer and those originally assured. The lower courts rightly held that the making of the reinsurance compacts in New York between respondent and insurers of property in Mississippi was not the doing of business in that state. And, as its consent to be sued there cannot be implied from any transactions within the state, there is no jurisdiction, unless respondent's authorization in respect of service is broad enough to extend to this case. Philadelphia & R. R. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264\n, 37 S. Ct. 280.\n The policy sued on was issued and the loss occurred in South America. The importation of such controversies would not serve any interest of Mississippi. The purpose of state statutes requiring the appointment by for- \n\n[279 U.S. 405, 409]\n\u00a0\n eign corporations of agents upon whom process may be served is primarily to subject them to the jurisdiction of local courts in controversies growing out of transactions within the state. Old Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v. McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8, 18\n, 21 S., 27 S. Ct. 236; Simon v. Southern Railway Co., \n236 \nU.S. 115, 130\n, 35 S. Ct. 255; Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Co., \n257 \nU.S. 213, 215\n, 42 S. Ct. 84; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Chatters, \n279 \nU.S. 320\n, 49 S. Ct. 329, 73 L. Ed. -. The language of the appointment and of the statute under which it was made plainly implies that the scope of the agency is intended to be so limited. By the terms of both, the authority continues only so long as any liability of the company remains outstanding in Mississippi. No decision of the state Supreme Court supports the construction for which petitioner contends. And, in the absence of language compelling it, such a statute ought not to be construed to impose upon the courts of the state the duty, or to give them power, to take cases arising out of transactions so foreign to its interests. The service of the summons cannot be sustained.\n Petitioner suggests that, by removal of the case to the federal court, objection to jurisdiction over the person of respondent was waived. Our decisions are to the contrary. General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 268\n, 43 S. Ct. 106; Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 653\n, 43 S. Ct. 230; Hassler v. Shaw, \n271 \nU.S. 195, 199\n, 46 S. Ct. 479. And petitioner asserts that, by joining its plea to the jurisdiction for lack of service with a plea in abatement because of another action pending, respondent appeared generally and submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court. But the pleas were authorized by state practice which, under the Conformity Act, is adopted in the federal court. Section 537, Hemingway's Code; U. S. C. Tit. 28,  724 (28 USCA  724); Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 209\n, 13 S.

L. RY. v. WHITE(1929)\nNo. 135\nArgued: January 11, 1929Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., for plaintiff in error and appellant.\n\n\n[278 U.S. 456, 458]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter P. Armstrong, of Memphis, Tenn., for defendants in error and appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are actions brought against the plaintiff in error and appellant for causing the death of W. B. White and personal injuries to the other plaintiffs by running down an automobile at a grade crossing in the city of Memphis. The plaintiffs obtained judgments that were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. W. B. White, who was killed, was driving the car, and his son, R. D. White, one of the plaintiffs, was sitting by his side. The Court states that both knew the Railway not to maintain a flagman and that they were grossly negligent in going upon the track. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Goodman, \n275 \nU.S. 66\n, 48 S. Ct. 24, 56 A. L. R. 645. The Court held, however, that the proximate cause of the injuries was the Railway's failure to comply with an ordinance of Memphis requiring all railroads on every street crossed by their trains to keep a flagman constantly on duty, to give warning of approaching trains by waving a flag in daytime and a red lighted lamp by night, until the engine had crossed the street. The validity of this ordinance is the only question open before us here.\n The Railway had substituted for the flagman an electric signal on the side of the street and about fifteen feet above it that gave warning by flashing a light and ringing a bell and was set in operation mechanically by the train when it came within 2,500 feet of the crossing. The contrivance \n\n[278 U.S. 456, 459]\n\u00a0\n was testified to be in general use and was said to be cheaper and in some ways at least better than the old precautions. The Railway contended that the ordinance enacted at the beginning of 1880 was valid no longer in view of the modern improvement and that to enforce it now would be to enforce an unnecessary burden on interstate commerce and would be so arbitrary as to amount to a denial of due process of law. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 400\n, 42 S. Ct. 351. (It may be mentioned that the train concerned was engaged in interstate commerce.) But the crossing in question was said by the Court to be a dangerous one where there was pretty constant travel by night and day, and it was held that as applied to such a crossing it could not be said that the ordinance was so indisputably unnecessary and unreasonable that the legislative judgment could be overruled.\n We are compelled to take the same view. The legislative arguments in favor of the Railway are manifest and we may conjecture that it is only a matter of time before the old methods of guarding grade crossings will have disappeared unless the grade crossings precede them. But if the ordinance were passed today and came up for a decision upon its validity, it could not be denied that a man in the middle of the street or near to it and intent on stopping traffic might stop some travellers who might not notice electric signs. There is a marginal chance that occasionally a life may be saved. In this very case it is at least possible that a man on the ground would have stopped the plaintiffs, they not being intent on suicide. No doubt legislatures do neglect such marginal chances. Many modern improvements must be expected to take their toll of life. When a railroad is built experience teaches that it is pretty certain to kill some people before it has lasted long. But a Court cannot condemn a legislature that refuses to allow the toll to be taken even if it \n\n[278 U.S. 456, 460]\n\u00a0\n thinks that the gain by the change would compensate for any such loss. It follows that we must affirm the judgments below. See Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S. Ct. 594\n\n\n There were some exceptions to the exclusion of evidence. But if they could be considered in any case they went only to proof that the new device is better than the old. We assume it to be so, but regard that assumption as not controlling the point considered here.\n As appeal was the proper mode of bringing the cases to this Court the writs of error may be dismissed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT.

Hill, all of Kansas City, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent in No. 456 brought suit in the circuit court of Jackson county, Mo., to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligent operation of one of petitioner's trains. The suit in No. 455 was brought in the same court by the husband of respondent in No. 456, to recover for the loss of her services. Both cases were removed to the District Court for Western Missouri, where they were tried together. Judgment there on a verdict for respondents was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 27 F.(2d) 699. This court granted certiorari October 15, 1928, \n278 \nU.S. 590\n, 49 S. Ct. 27, 73 L. Ed. -, the order allowing the writ directing \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n that the argument in this court 'be limited to the question whether the alleged misconduct of counsel for the plaintiffs in their arguments to the jury was so unfairly prejudicial to the defendant as to justify a new trial.'\n At the trial, there was evidence that respondent, while a passenger on petitioner's train, was thrown to the floor by a sudden and unusual motion of the train, receiving a blow on her head which caused paralysis of one side of the body, impaired locomotion, and other physical disabilities. All material allegations of the complaint were denied, including those specially setting up the cause and nature of respondent's injuries. In the course of the cross-examination of respondents' witnesses, petitioner's counsel elicited the fact that, following the accident, one of respondent's physicians had administered a treatment usually given for syphilis. He asked other questions tending to show, had favorable answers been received, that she had exhibited symptoms recognized to be those of this disease; that the Wasserman test for syphilis, which had been applied to her by her physician with negative results, was not necessarily conclusive as to its nonexistence; that other more reliable tests had not been applied; that the disease might cause the paralysis complained of and the treatment for it produce the other symptoms exhibited by respondent.\n The opening statement for petitioner to the jury had contained no suggestion that the alleged condition of respondent was due to syphilis. No evidence to that effect was offered in its behalf, counsel contenting himself with calling witnesses to disprove only the negligence and the occurrence of the accident. In the closing argument, petitioner's counsel denied any belief that respondent was afflicted with the disease, and disclaimed any purpose to show that her present condition was due to it. He then for the first time suggested, although there was no \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n evidence to support it, that her condition was caused by the administration, by one of her physicians, of a specific for syphilis in consequence of a mistaken diagnosis.\n Two counsel for respondents participated in the closing argument. The first, who preceded counsel for petitioner, made the following statements to the jury, to which, at several points, objection was made, overruled, and an exception noted:\n'But, gentlemen, the vilest defense made in this case, a defense which would bar that girl from all society, intimated in this case that she had the syphilis. That is the defense in this case, that she had syphilis.\n\n'Gentlemen of the jury, they would charge her with a disease which would brand her as bad as a leper and exclude her from the society of decent people. That is the kind of a defense that is in this case, and I resent it. I resent the New York Central coming into this town and saying that that girl has the syphilis and trying to make this jury believe that she has the syphilis.\n\n'She will be a misery to herself; every time she attempts to take a step and is unable to do so, she suffers mental anguish; every time she sees people watching her, and knowing what she is doing, she suffers mental anguish. And gentlemen, it is sought to say that that is the result of syphilis. Syphilis, one of the most-the worst disease that is known in human history, a disease that can never be freed from the body; a disease that is worse than leprosy. That is the defense in this case. And, gentlemen, with not one, not one scintilla of evidence in this case to justify it.'\n\n The second counsel for respondents, whose argument followed that of petitioner's counsel and his disclaimer \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n already mentioned, was permitted, over objection and exception, to say to the jury:\n'You mean to tell me he (petitioner's counsel) didn't talk to those doctors about it? ... That he wasn't aware of that, and he wasn't trying to put the stigma of indecency upon this young woman in his defense? You mean to say that he wasn't aware of that situation?\n\n'Oh, I have been too long in this business of trying law suits not to know that. So I immediately came to the front and exposed him, and proved it to the hilt; so much so that they stopped. ... Never again will you ever dare to put that letter of syphilis upon the brow of a decent woman-'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment for respondent, said, page 702 of 27 F.(2d):\n'Both counsel for the plaintiff who addressed the jury stated that ...\n\n\"The vilest defense made in this case, a defense which would bar that girl from all society, intimated in this case that she had the syphilis. That is the defense in this case, that she had the syphilis.'\n\n'And then they proceeded to dilate on and exploit this text. We find no justification for this assumption, or for the verbal pyrotechnics that counsel were permitted to indulge in over the objections of the attorneys for the defendant. The defense put no witnesses on the stand to controvert the plaintiff's evidence that the plaintiff did not have syphilis. The only evidence counsel for the plaintiff cites as justifying their argument was the cross-examination of some of plaintiff's witnesses; but an affirmative defense of this character cannot ordinarily be proved by cross-examination. Moreover, defendant's interrogatories along this line were no more than a continuation of similar questions propounded on the direct examination. We therefore deem it proper to \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n observe that this line of argument was likely to create prejudice, and did not aid the court or jury in the performance of their duties.'\n\n Petitioner argues, as the court below stated, that there was no defense in the case that respondent's condition was due to syphilis, that the quoted remarks of counsel were without foundation in the record, and that they were so prejudicial as to deprive petitioner of a fair trial.\n From what has been said, it is apparent, as respondents assert, that in a strict sense the Court of Appeals did not, by the remarks quoted, correctly interpret the record or characterize with accuracy the issue which had been raised under the pleadings by the evidence. The burden was on respondents to prove that the physical condition complained of was caused by injuries received on petitioner's train. It was open to petitioner, if so advised, to seek in good faith to show that respondent's condition was not due to the accident, but was attributable to disease as an independent cause. This was a matter of defense which, under petitioner's general denial, might have been established either by the cross-examination of respondents' witnesses or by the testimony of its own.\n Examination of the record discloses that counsel for petitioner took the initiative in attempting to develop, by cross-examination of respondents' witnesses, evidence whose only apparent purpose was to support this defense, and this course was continued by him through a considerable portion of the trial. He first directed the inquiry to the symptoms of respondent which, if they existed, would have indicated that she was suffering from the disease. He first brought out that she had been subjected by her own physicians to the Wasserman test. But whatever motive inspired this course of conduct, it was evident that this line of defense came to nothing. The cross-examina- \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n tion developed little of moment, and no witnesses were called by petitioner to support it. At the close of the case it was apparent that the attempted or suggested defense that respondent's condition was due to syphilis was without substance, and it was formally abandoned by petitioner's counsel in his address to the jury.\n In this condition of the record, the repeated statements of counsel that syphilis was the defense, coupled with the vituperative language which we have quoted and the statements that the petitioner had charged respondent with indecency, made in the face of testimony of respondents' own witness that the disease was frequently transmitted by the use of drinking cups or other innocent means, was not fair comment on the evidence or justified by the record. Cf. Cherry Creek Nat. Bank v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 207 App. Div. 787, 202 N. Y. S. 611; Grabowsky v. Baumgart, 128 Mich. 267, 272, 87 N. W. 891; Fisher v. Weinholzer, 91 Minn. 22, 25, 97 N. W. 426; Strudgeon v. Village of Sand Beach, 107 Mich. 496, 504, 65 N. W. 616. Their obvious purpose and effect were improperly to influence the verdict by their appeal to passion and prejudice.\n However ill advised, counsel for petitioner was within his rights in following this line of inquiry, and, even if it be assumed that the situation was one calling for comment on the evidence so elicited, neither petitioner nor its counsel was on trial for pursuing it. Want of good judgment or good taste, or even misconduct on the part of either, was not an issue in the case for the jury, nor could it excuse like conduct on the part of respondents' counsel. See Tucker v. Henniker, 41 N. H. 317, 322; Mittleman v. Bartikowsky, 283 Pa. 485, 488, 129 A. 566; Mitchum v. State of Georgia, 11 Ga. 615, 629; Welch v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 117 Iowa, 394, 404, 90 N. W. 828. An exhibition of any or all of these faults was not ground for a verdict in respondents' favor or for enhancing it.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 310, 318]\n\u00a0\n Such a bitter and passionate attack on petitioner's conduct of the case, under circumstances tending to stir the resentment and arouse the prejudice of the jury, should have been promptly suppressed. See Masterson v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co., 102 Wis. 571, 574, 78 N. W. 757; Gulf, Colorado & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Butcher, 83 Tex. 309, 316, 18 S. W. 583; Tucker v. Henniker, supra, at page 322 of 41 N. H.; Monroe v. Chicago & Alton R. Co., 297 Mo. 633, 644, 249 S. W. 644, 257 S. W. 469. The failure of the trial judge to sustain petitioner's objection or otherwise to make certain that the jury would disregard the appeal could only have left them with the impression that they might properly be influenced by it in rendering their verdict, and thus its prejudicial effect was enhanced. See Hall v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 76, 81\n, 14 S. Ct. 22 (37 L. Ed. 1003); Graves v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 118, 121\n, 14 S. Ct. 40 (37 L. Ed. 1021); Wilson v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 60, 68\n, 13 S. Ct. 765 (37 L. Ed. 650). That the quoted remarks of respondents' counsel so plainly tended to excite prejudice as to be ground for reversal, is, we think, not open to argument. The judgments must be reversed, with instructions to grant a new trial.\n Respondents urge that the objections were not sufficiently specific to justify a reversal. But a trial in court is never, as respondents in their brief argue this one was, 'purely a private controversy ... of no importance to the public.' The state, whose interest it is the duty of court and counsel alike to uphold, is concerned that every litigation be fairly and impartially conducted and that verdicts of juries be rendered only on the issues made by the pleadings and the evidence. The public interest requires that the court of its own motion, as is its power and duty, protect suitors in their right to a verdict, uninfluenced by the appeals of counsel to passion or prejudice. See Union Pac. R. Co. v. Field ( C. C. A.) 137 F. 14, 15; Brown v. Swineford, 44 Wis. 282, 293 (28 Am. Rep. 582). Where such paramount considerations are involved, the failure of counsel to particularize an exception will not preclude this court from \n\n[279 U.S. 310, 319]\n\u00a0\n correcting the error. Brasfield v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 448, 450\n, 47 S. Ct. 135 (71 L. Ed. 345).\n As there must be a new trial, attention should be directed to other objectionable conduct by respondents' counsel in the course of the trial; their repeated assertion, without supporting evidence, that the defense was a 'claim agent defense'; references to petitioner as an 'eastern railroad'; and statements that the railroad had 'come into this town' and that witnesses and records had been 'sent on from New York' for the trial of the cause. Such remarks of counsel, and others of similar character, all tending to create an atmosphere of hostility toward petitioner as a railroad corporation located in another section of the country have been so often condemned as an appeal to sectional or local prejudice as to require no comment. See Cherry Creek Nat. Bank v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., supra; Dolph v. Lake Shore, etc., R. Co., 149 Mich. 278, 280, 112 N. W. 981; Southern R. Co. v. Simmons, 105 Va. 651, 665, 55 S. E. 459.\n These writs of certiorari were granted on a petition signed by counsel for petitioner who did not participate in the trial. It stated that the cases were of importance and were such a departure 'from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, as to call for an exercise of this Court's power of supervision.' But his argument here was so inadequately prepared and exhibited such lack of familiarity with the record as not to be of assistance to the court, and in the argument of counsel on both sides who had participated in the trial below there was a want of that candor which is essential to the proper and adequate presentation of a cause in this court. The occasion seems appropriate to remind counsel that the attempted presentation of cases without adequate preparation and with want of fairness and candor discredits the bar and obstructs the administration of justice.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNIELSEN v. JOHNSON(1929)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nelson Miller, of Le Mars, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. John Fletcher, Atty. Gen. of Iowa, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, granted June 4, 1928, \n277 \nU.S. 583\n, 48 S. Ct. 600), under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344), to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa, affirming a judgment of the Plymouth district court imposing an inheritance tax on the estate of petitioner's intestate. Anders Anderson, the intestate, a citizen of the kingdom of Denmark residing in Iowa, died there February 9, 1923, leaving his mother, a resident and citizen of Denmark, his sole heir at law and entitled by inheritance, under the laws of Iowa, to his net estate of personal property, aggregating $3,006.37. By section 7315, c. 351, Code of Iowa (1927), the estate of a decedent passing to his mother or other named close relatives, if alien nonresidents of the United States, \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n is subject to an inheritance tax of 10 per cent., but by section 7313 an estate of less than $15,000, as was decedent's, passing to a parent who is not such a nonresident alien is tax free. In the proceedings in the state court for fixing the inheritance tax, petitioner asserted that the provisions of the statutes referred to, so far as they authorized a tax upon this decedent's estate, were void as in conflict with article 7 of the Treaty of April 26, 1826, between the United States and Denmark (8 Stat. 340, 342), renewed in 1857 (11 Stat. 719, 720), reading as follows:\n'Article 7. The United States and his Danish Majesty mutually agree, that no higher or other duties, charges, or taxes of any kind, shall be levied in the territories or dominions of either party, upon any personal property, money, or effects, of their respective citizens or subjects, on the removal of the same from their territories or dominions reciprocally, either upon the inheritance of such property, money, or effects, or otherwise, than are or shall be payable in each state, upon the same, when removed by a citizen or subject of such state respectively.'\n\n The Supreme Court of Iowa, 218 N. W. 140, following its earlier decision, In re Estate of Pedersen, 198 Iowa, 166, 196 N. W. 785, upheld the statute as not in conflict with the treaty.\n In Petersen v. Iowa, \n245 \nU.S. 170\n, 38 S. Ct. 109, this court held, following Frederickson v. Louisiana, 23 How. 445, that article 7 was intended to apply only to the property of citizens of one country located within the other and so placed no limitation upon the power of either government to deal with its own citizens and their property within its own dominion. Hence, it did not preclude the inheritance tax there imposed upon the estate of a resident citizen of Iowa at a higher rate upon legacies to a citizen and resident of Denmark than upon similar legacies to citizens or residents of the United States. The court said (at page 172 of 245 U. S. (38 S. Ct. 110)):\n'Conceding that it (article 7) requires construction to determine whether the prohibitions embrace taxes ge- \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n nerically considered, or death duties, or excises, on the right to transfer and remove property, singly or collectively, we are of the opinion that the duty of interpretation does not arise since in no event would any of the prohibitions be applicable to the case before us.'\n\n But, in the present case, the decedent was a citizen of Denmark, owning property within the state of Iowa, and article 7, by its terms, in applicable to charges or taxes levied on the personal property or effects of such a citizen; hence its protection may be invoked here if the discrimination complained of is one embraced within the terms of the treaty.\n That there is a discrimination based on alienage is evident, since the tax is imposed only when the nonresident heirs are also aliens. But it is argued by respondent, as the court below held, that the present tax is not prohibited by the treaty since it is one upon succession (In re Estate of Thompson, 196 Iowa, 721, 195 N. W. 250, In re Meinert's Estate, 204 Iowa, 355, 213 N. W. 938), and not on property or its removal which, it is said, is alone forbidden; and that in any case since the only tax discrimination aimed at by article 7 in cases of inheritance is that upon the power of disposal of the estate, and not the provilege of succession, the particular discrimination complained of is not forbidden, for the statutes of Iowa permit a citizen of Denmark to dispose of his estate of citizens and residents of Denmark on the same terms as a citizen of Iowa to like nonresident alien beneficiaries.\n The narrow and restricted interpretation of the treaty contended for by respondent, while permissible and often necessary in construing two statutes of the same legislative body in order to give effect to both so far as is reasonably possible, is not consonant with the principles which are controlling in the interpretation of treaties. Treaties are to be liberally construed, so as to effect the apparent intention of the parties. Jordan v. Tashiro (No. 13, October Term, 1928), 278 \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 123, 49 S. Ct. 47, 73 L. Ed. -; Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 271\n, 10 S. Ct. 295, 33 S. Ct. 642; In re Ross, 140 U. .S. 453, 475, 11 S. Ct. 897; Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424\n, 22 S. Ct. 195. When a treaty provision fairly admits of two constructions, one restricting, the other enlarging, rights which may be claimed under it, the more liberal interpretation is to be preferred. Asakura v. Seattle, \n265 \nU.S. 332\n, 44 S. Ct. 515; Tucker v. Alexandroff, supra; Geofroy v. Riggs, supra. And as the treaty-making power is independent of and superior to the legislative power of the states, the meaning of treaty provisions so construed is not restricted by any necessity of avoiding possible conflict with state legislation and when so ascertained must prevail over inconsistent state enactments. See Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199; Jordan v. Tashiro, supra, cf. Cheung Sum Shee v. Nagle, \n268 \nU.S. 336\n, 45 S. Ct. 539. When their meaning is uncertian, recourse may be had to the negotiations and diplomatic correspondence of the contracting parties relating to the subject-matter and to their own practical construction of it. Cf. In re Ross, supra, 140 U. S. at page 467, 11 S. Ct. 897; United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 16 S. Ct. 725; Kinkead v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 486\n, 14 S. Ct. 172; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 223\n, 44 S. Ct. 15.\n The history of article 7 and references to its provisions in displomatic exchanges between the United States and Denmark leave little doubt that its purpose was both to relieve the citizens of each country from onerous taxes upon their property within the other and to enable them to dispose of such property, paying only such duties as are exacted of the inhabitants of the place of its situs, as suggested by this court in Petersen v. Iowa, supra, \n245 \nU.S. 174\n, 38 S. Ct. 109, and also to extend like protection to alien heirs of the noncitizen.\n On March 5, 1924, Mr. Pedersen, Minister of Denmark to the United States, presented to John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, a project of convention for the consideration of this government. This project dealt with the commercial relations between the two countries and their \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n territories and the appointment of consular officers, but did not contain any provisions corresponding to article 7. On January 14, 1826, certain citizens of the United States addressed to Henry Clay, then Secretary of State, a memorial complaining of certain taxes, imposed by the Danish government with respect to property of citizens of the United States located in the Danish West Indies, known as 'sixths' and 'tenths,' the former being one-sixth of the value of the property, payable to the crown, and the latter a further one-tenth of the residue, payable to the town or county magistrate, as a prerequisite to removal of property from the Islands. Both taxes ere imposed on the property inherited by an alien heir. Danish Laws, Code of Christian V, book V, c. 2,  76, 77, 78, 79. The memorial prayed that an article be inserted in the treaty then contemplated with Denmark, comparable to the similar provisions of existing treaties between Denmark and Great Britain and Denmark and France, forbidding the imposition of taxes of this character.\n Previously, on November 7, 1825, Mr. Clay had addressed a note to the Minister of Denmark, setting forth the conditions under which the United States would be disposed to proceed with negotiations. 3 Notes to Foreign Legations, 451. The note included, in numbered paragraphs, certain proposals which the government of the United States desired to have considered in connection with the draft convention submitted by the Danish Minister. Paragraph 5 was as follows:\n'When citizens or subjects of the one party die in the country of the other, their estates shall not be subject to any droit de de traction, but shall pass to their successors, free from all duty.'\n\n In a letter of April 14, 1826, shortly before the execution of the treaty, the Danish Minister transmitted to Mr. Clay a copy of what he termed 'the additional article to the late convention between Denmark and Great \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n Britain respecting the mutual abolition of the droit de de traction.' This article, dated June 16, 1824, is substantially in the phraseology of article 7 of the present treaty between the United States and Denmark. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In the communication of Mr. Clay to the Danish charge d'affaires of November 10, 1826, following the ratification of the treaty, referring to article 7; he said: 'The object which the government of the United States had in view in that stipulation, was to secure the right of their citizens to bring their money and movable property home from the Danish islands, free from charges or duties and especially from the onerous law, known in those islands, under the denominations of sixths and tenths. This object was distinctly known to Mr. Pedersen, throughout the whole of the negotiation, and was expressly communicated by me to him in writing.' In the reply of the following day, the Danish charge d'affaires stated: 'I have been authorized ... to declare to you, that measures have been taken accordingly by the Danish government, to secure the due execution of the seventh article of the convention, conformably to the intent and meaning thereof as by you stated. ...'\n The droit de de traction, referred to in the communication of Mr. Clay of November 7, 1825, and in the note of \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n the Danish minister of April 14, 1826, in which he identified that phrase with the tax prohibited by the additional article of the treaty between Denmark and Great Britain of June 16, 1824, similar in terms to the article now before us, was a survival from medieval European law of a then well-recognized form of tax, imposed with respect to the right of an alien heir to acquire or withdraw from the realm the property inherited. \n2\n Although often referred to as a tax on property or its withdrawal, the droit de de traction seems rather to have been a form of inheritance tax, but one which, because of its imposition only with respect to property of aliens who normally removed it from the realm, was sometimes associated with the re- \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n moval rather than the inheritance of the property. It was limited to inheritances, existed with and supplemented other taxes, the droit de retraite or the droit de sortie, imposed on the removal of property other than inheritances (Guyot, Re pertoire de Jurisprudence (1785) Sortie; Galvo, Distionnaire du Droit International (1885) De traction; Oppenheim, International Law (4th Ed. 1928) 559), and was, in most cases, applied regardless of the subsequent disposition of the property (Merlin, Re pertoire de Jurisprudence (5th Ed. 1827) De traction; Guyot, supra, De traction). Its origin and an examination of the commentators likewise leave no doubt that the droit de de traction-the tax-accrued upon the death of the decedent, and only after it had been collected was the heir entitled to take possession of the property and remove or otherwise dispose of it. \n3\n It was thus the \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 57]\n\u00a0\n precursor of the modern inheritance tax, differing from it in its essentials solely in that it was levied only where one of the parties to the inheritance was an alien or nonresident. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n That the present discriminatory tax is the substantial equivalent of the droit de de traction is not open to doubt. That it was the purpose of the high contracting parties to prohibit discriminatory taxes of this nature clearly appears from the diplomatic correspondence preceding and subsequent to the execution of the treaty, although the 'sixths and tenths' tax, with which the parties were immediately concerned, was a removal tax.\n We think also that the language of article 7, interpreted with that liberality demanded for treaty provisions, sufficiently expresses this purpose. It is true that the tax prohibited by the treaty is in terms a tax on property or on its removal, but it is also true that the modern conception of an inheritance tax as a tax on the privilege of transmitting or succeeding to property of a decedent, rather than on the property itself, was probably unknown to the draftsmen of article 7. But whatever, in point of present day legal theory, is the subject of the tax, it is the property transmitted which pays it, as the Iowa statute carefully provides. 5 In the face of the broad language embracing 'charges, or taxes of any kind, ... upon any personal property ... on the removal \n\n[279 U.S. 47, 58]\n\u00a0\n of the same ... either upon the inheritance of such property, ... or otherwise,' the omission, at that time, of words more specifically describing inheritance taxes as now defined, can hardly be deemed to evidence any intention not to include taxes theoretically levied upon the right to transmit or inherit, but which nevertheless were to be paid from the inheritance before it could be possessed or removed. Moreover, while it is true that the tax is levied whether the property is actually removed or not, it is, nevertheless, imposed only with respect to a class of persons who would normally find it necessary so to remove the property in order to enjoy it, and since payment of the tax is a prerequisite to removal, the tax is, in its practical operation, one on removal. In the light of the avowed purpose of the Treaty to forbid discriminatory taxes of this character, and its use of language historically deemed to embrace them, such effect should be given to its provisions.\n The contention that the present discrimination is not one forbidden by the language of article 7, since the decedent's power of disposal is the same as that of a citizen, leaves out of consideration both the nature of the tax contemplated by the contracting parties and the fact that the treaty provisions extend explicitly to the withdrawal of such property by the alien heir upon inheritance and, as already pointed out, protect him in his right to receive his inheritance undiminished by a tax which is not imposed upon citizens of the other contracting party.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Their Britannick and Danish Majesties mutually agree, that no higher or other Duties shall be levied, in either of Their Dominions ... upon any personal property of Their respective Subjects, on the removal of the same from the Dominions of Their said Majesties reciprocally, (either upon the inheritance of such property, or otherwise), than are or shall be payable in each State, upon the like property, when removed by a Subject of such State respectively.' 12 British and Foreign State Papers, 1824- 1825 (1826) 49. Article 40 of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, concluded between France and Denmark August 23, 1742, provided that the citizens of each of the two countries reciprocally should be exempt in the other from the droit d'aubaine or other similar disability, under whatever name, and that their heirs should succeed to their property without impediment. 1 Coercq, Recueil des Traite  de la France (1864) 57. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The droit de de traction was derived from the droit d'aubaine, one of the many harsh feudal laws and customs directed against strangers and which, in its narrowest sense, was the right of the sovereign, as successor of the feudal lords, to appropriate all the property of a nonnaturalized alien dying, either testate or intestate, within the realm. 1 Calvo, Dictionnaire de Droit International (1885) 67, Aubaine; 1 Merlin, Re pertoire de Jurisprudence (5th Ed. 1827) 523, aubaine; Halleck, International Law (1861) 155; 2 Ferriere, Oeuvres de Bacquet (1778) 8 et seq. This right was exercised to the exclusion of all heirs whether they were citizens or aliens or resided within or without the realm, with the single exception of resident legitimate offspring, and continued to be exercised long after aliens had been accorded unrestricted power of disposition of goods inter vivos.

The term has, however, sometimes been applied to all the varying disabilities of aliens, Fiore, Le Droit International Prive (1907) 14, and more often used to include not only the inability of the alien to transmit but the complementary incapacity of an alien to inherit, even from a citizen, Merlin, supra, Aubaine.\n But commercial expediency led, at an early date, to a mitigation of the rigors of the droit d'aubaine. This process took several forms, the exemption of alien merchants in certain trading centers, of certain classes of individuals (ex soldiers, etc.) and, most prominently, treaties providing for its reciprocal abandonment or contraction. In these treaties, the droit de de traction was recognized as a tax, of from five to twenty, usually ten, per cent. of the value, imposed on the right of an alien to acquire by inheritance (testate or intestate) the property of persons dying within the realm.

The droit d'aubaine and the droit de de traction were abolished in France by decrees of the Assembly in 1790 and 1791, but subsequently reappeared in the Civil Code, arts. 726, 912, with provision for abandonment as to a nation according similar treatment to French nationals. They were again abolished, with certain protective provisions for French heirs, by the Law of Jury 14, 1819.

CONWAY(1929)\nNo. 514\nArgued: February 26, 1929Decided: March 5, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. S. L. Herold, of Shreveport, La., for appellant.\n Mr. Wood H. Thompson, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is a suit to prevent the enforcement against the plaintiff of a statute of Louisiana (Act 5 of 1928) amending a prior \n\n[279 U.S. 813, 814]\n\u00a0\n statute (Act 140 of 1922) imposing a severance tax on the production of oil as a natural product of the soil. The prior act fixed the tax at three per cent. of the market value of the oil at the time and place of severance, and the amendatory act makes it a graduated tax ranging from 4 to 11 cents per barrel according to the gravity of the oil. As applied to the plaintiff's operations the tax fixed by the amendatory act is about $ 12,000 more in each period of three months than the tax under the prior act would be for the like period. While admitting the validity of the prior act and declaring a willingness and readiness to pay the tax imposed thereby, the plaintiff alleges that the changed and enlarged tax imposed by the amendatory act is invalid in that that act as applied to the plaintiff's operations contravenes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and also a provision of the Constitution of the state requiring that severance taxes be predicated upon 'either the quantity or value' of the product at the time and place of its severance.\n The parties are citizens of different states and the matter in controversy exceeds in value the jurisdictional requirement. On bringing the suit, the plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the enforcement against it of the amendatory act pending the decree on final hearing; but the District Court, composed of three judges conformably to section 380 of title 28 of the United States Code (28 USCA  380), denied the application. An appeal from that order brings it under review.\n The application for an interlocutory injunction was submitted on ex parte affidavits, which are harmonious in some particulars and contradictory in others. The affidavits, especially those for the defendant, are open to the criticism that on some points mere conclusions are given, instead of primary facts. But enough appears to make it plain that there is a real dispute over material questions \n\n[279 U.S. 813, 815]\n\u00a0\n of fact, which cannot be satisfactorily resolved upon the present affidavits, and yet must be resolved before the constitutional validity of the amendatory statute can be determined.\n The statute provides for the enforced payment of the tax quarterly in each year. If the tax be paid during the pendency of the suit, and the statute be adjudged invalid by the final decree, the plaintiff will be remediless. The laws of the state afford no remedy whereby restitution of the money so paid may be enforced, even where the payment is under both protest and compulsion.\n Where the questions presented by an application for an interlocutory injunction are grave, and the injury to the moving party will be certain and irreparable, if the application be denied and the final decree be in his favor, while if the injunction be granted the injury to the opposing party, even if the final decree be in his favor, will be inconsiderable, or may be adequately indemnified by a bond, the injunction usually will be granted. Love v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 185 F. 321, 331, 332.\n Under this rule, and in view of the entire absence under the local law of any remedy enforceable by the plaintiff, if the tax be paid and afterwards held invalid by the final decree, we are of opinion that the application for an interlocutory injunction should have been granted, and that this should have been done upon terms requiring that the plaintiff (a) punctually and regularly pay the tax fixed by the prior act; (b) give an adequate bond whereby, in the event the amendatory act is adjudged valid by the final decree, the plaintiff and its surety will be obligated to pay, with interest and without other penalty, such further amounts as may be necessary, with the prior payments, to satisfy the tax fixed by that act; and (c) prosecute the suit with reasonable expedition to a final decree. \n\n[279 U.S. 813, 816]\n\u00a0\n The order is accordingly vacated, with directions for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLD COLONY TRUST CO. v. COM'R OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1929)\nNo. 130\nArgued: April 15, 1929Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n Revenue \n279 U.S. 716\n (1929) ]\n\n\n[279 U.S. 716, 718]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur A. Ballantine and George E. Cleary, both of New York City, for Old Colony Trust Co. and others.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We have before us for consideration two questions certified from the same Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 130 and No. 129. They are presented upon different statements of facts, and the cases reach the certifying court in different ways, but the questions are so nearly alike that the certifying judges deemed it convenient to present them in consolidated form. We prefer to separate the questions, discuss and decide No. 130 first, and then consider No. 129.\n No. 130 comes here by certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The action in that court was begun by a petition to review a decision of the United \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 719]\n\u00a0\n States Board of Tax Appeals. The petitioners are the executors of the will of William M. Wood, deceased. On June 27, 1925, before Mr. Wood's death, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue notified him by registered mail of the determination of a deficiency in income tax against him for the years 1919 and 1920, under the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). The deficiency was revised by the Commissioner August 18, 1925. An appeal was taken to the Board of Tax Appeals, which was filed October 27, 1925. A hearing before the Board, April 11, 1927, resulted in a decision November 12, 1927. The Board approved the action of the Commissioner, and found a deficiency in the federal income tax return of Mr. Wood for the year 1919 of $708,781.93, and for the year 1920 of $350,837.14. The petition for review was perfected December 23, 1927, pursuant to the Revenue Act of 1926,  283(j), and sections 1001 to 1005, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 65, 109; 26 USCA  1064(j), and  1224-1228, and rule 38 of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The facts certified to us are substantially as follows:\n William M. Wood was president of the American Woolen Company during the years 1918, 1919, and 1920. In 1918 he received as salary and commissions from the company $978,725, which he included in his federal income tax return for 1918. In 1919 he received as salary and commissions from the company $548,132.87, which he included in his return for 1919\n\n\n August 3, 1916, the American Woolen Company had adopted the following resolution, which was in effect in 1919 and 1920:\n'Voted: That this company pay any and all income taxes, State and Federal, that may hereafter become due and payable upon the salaries of all the officers of the company, including the president, William M. Wood; the comptroller, Parry C. Wiggin; the auditor, George R. Lawton; and the following members of the staff, to wit: Frank H. Carpenter, Edwin L. Heath, Samuel R. Haines, \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 720]\n\u00a0\n and William M. Lasbury, to the end that said persons and officers shall receive their salaries or other compensation in full without deduction on account of income taxes, State or Federal, which taxes are to be paid out of the treasury of this corporation.'\n\n This resolution was amended on March 25, 1918, as follows:\n'Voted: That, referring to the vote passed by this board on August 3, 1916, in reference to income taxes, State and Federal, payable upon the salaries or compensation of the officers and certain employees of this company, the method of computing said taxes shall be as follows, viz.:\n\n\"The difference between what the total amount of his tax would be, including his income from all sources, and the amount of his tax when computed upon his income excluding such compensation or salaries paid by this company.\"\n\n Pursuant to these resolutions, the American Woolen Company paid to the collector of internal revenue Mr. Wood's federal income and surtaxes due to salary and commissions paid him by the company, as follows:\n Taxes for 1918 paid in 1919 $681,169 88 Taxes for 1919 paid in 1920 351,179 27\n The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals here sought to be reviewed was that the income taxes of $681,169.88 and $351,179.27 paid by the American Woolen Company for Mr. Wood were additional income to him for the years 1919 and 1920.\n The question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals for answer by this Court is:\n'Did the payment by the employer of the income taxes assessable against the employee constitute additional taxable income to such employee?'\n\n The first point presented to us is that of the jurisdiction of this Court to answer the question of law certified. It \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 721]\n\u00a0\n requires us to examine the original statute providing for the Board of Tax Appeals under the Revenue Act of 1924, and the amending act of 1926.\n The Board of Tax Appeals, established by section 900 of the Revenue Act of 1924, tit. 9, c. 243, 43 Stat. 253, 336 (26 USCA  1211, note, et seq.), was created by Congress to provide taxpayers an opportunity to secure an independent review of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's determination of additional income and estate taxes by the Board in advance of their paying the tax found by the Commissioner to be due. Before the act of 1924, the taxpayer could only contest the Commissioner's determination of the amount of the tax after its payment. The Board's duty under the act of 1924 was to hear, consider, and decide whether deficiencies reported by the Commissioner were right.\n Section 273 of that act (26 USCA  1047) defined a 'deficiency' to be the amount by which the tax imposed exceeded the amount shown by the return of the taxpayer after the return was increased by the amounts previously assessed or disallowed. There was under the act of 1924 no direct judicial review of the proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals. But each party had the unhindered right to seek separate action by a court of competent jurisdiction to test the correctness of the Board's action. Such court proceedings were to be begun within one year after the final decision of the Board.\n Section 274(b); 26 USCA  1049, note, provided that, if the Board determined there was a deficiency, the amount so determined should be assessed and paid upon notice and demand from the collector. No part of the amount determined as a deficiency by the Commissioner, but disallowed as a deficiency by the Board, could be assessed, but the Commissioner was at liberty, notwithstanding the decision of the Board against him, to bring a suit in a proper court against the taxpayer to collect the alleged deficiency.\n On the other hand, by section 900(g); 26 USCA  1218, note, it was provided that, in any suit brought by the Commissioner, or by the taxpayer \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 722]\n\u00a0\n to recover any amounts paid in pursuance of a decision of the Board, the findings of the Board were prima facie evidence of the facts.\n By the Revenue Act of 1926, this procedure was changed, and a direct judicial review of the Board's decision was substituted.\n The act of 1926 also enlarged the original jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals to consider deficiencies beyond those shown in the Commissioner's notice, if the Commissioner made such a claim at or before the hearing (section 274(e); 26 USCA  1048c), and also to determine that the taxpayer not only did not owe the tax but had over paid (section 284(e ); 26 USCA  1065, note).\n The chief change made by the act of 1926 was the provision for direct judicial review of the Board's decisions by the filing by the Commissioner or the taxpayer of a petition for review in a Circuit Court of Appeals or the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia under rules adopted by such courts.\n It is suggested that the proceedings before the Circuit Courts of Appeals or the District Court of Appeals on a petition to review are and can not be judicial, for they involve 'no case or controversy,' and without this a Circuit Court of Appeals, which is a constitutional court ( Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, No. 17, Original, \n279 \nU.S. 438\n, 49 S. Ct. 411, 73 L. Ed. -, decided May 20, 1929) is incapable of exercising its judicial function. This view of the nature of the proceedings we cannot sustain.\n The case is analogous to the suits which are lodged in the Circuit Courts of Appeals upon petition or finding of an executive or administrative tribunal. It is not important whether such a proceeding was originally begun by an administrative or executive determination, if, when it comes to the court, whether legislative or constitutional, it calls for the exercise of only the judicial power of the court upon which jurisdiction has been conferred by law. \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 723]\n\u00a0\n The jurisdiction in this cause is quite like that of Circuit Courts of Appeals in review of orders of the Federal Trade Commission. Federal Trade Commission v. Eastman Kodak Co., \n274 \nU.S. 623\n, 47 S. Ct. 688; Silver Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 292 F. 752. There are other instances of a like kind which can be cited. United States v. Ritchie, 17 How. 525, 534; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 469\n, 14 S. Ct. 1125; Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445, 477\n, 19 S. Ct. 722. See, also, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 714\n, 13 S. Ct. 1016.\n It is not necessary that the proceeding to be judicial should be one entirely de novo. It is enough that, before the judgment which must be final has been invoked as an exercise of judicial power, it shall have certain necessary features. What these are has been often declared by this Court. Perhaps the most comprehensive definitions of them are set forth in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 356\n, 31 S. Ct. 250, where this Court entered into the inquiry what was the exercise of judicial power as conferred by the Constitution. There was cited there a definition by Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Railway Commission (C. C.) 32 F. 241, 255, which has been generally accepted as accurate. He said:\n'The judicial article of the Constitution mentions cases and controversies. The term 'controversies,' if distinguishable at all from 'cases,' is so in that it is less comprehensive than the latter, and includes only suits of a civil nature. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 431, 432, (1 L. Ed. 440); 1 Tuck. Bl. Comm. App. 420, 421. By cases and controversies are intended the claims of litigants brought before the courts for determination by such regular proceedings as are established by law or custom for the protection or enforcement of rights, or the prevention, redress, or punishment of wrongs. Whenever the claim of a party under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 724]\n\u00a0\n States takes such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon it, then it has become a case. The term implies the existence of present or possible adverse parties whose contentions are submitted to the court for adjudication.'\n\n In Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, page 819, Chief Justice Marshall construed article 3 of the Constitution as follows:\n'This clause enables the judicial department to receive jurisdiction to the full extent of the constitution, laws and treaties of the United States, when any question respecting them shall assume such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting on it. That power is capable of acting only when the subject is submitted to it, by a party who asserts his rights in the form prescribed by law. It then becomes a case, and the constitution declares, that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the constitution, laws and treaties of the United States.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals is a constitutional court under the definition of such courts as given in the Bakelite Case, supra, and a case or controversy may come before it, provided it involves neither advisory nor executive action by it.\n In the case we have here, there are adverse parties. The United States or its authorized official asserts its right to the the payment by a taxpayer of a tax due from him to the government, and the taxpayer is resisting that payment or is seeking to recover what he has already paid as taxes when by law they were not properly due. That makes a case or controversy, and the proper disposition of it is the exercise of judicial power. The courts are either the Circuit Court of Appeals or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The subject-matter of the controversy is the amount of the tax claimed to be due or \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 725]\n\u00a0\n refundable and its validity, and the judgment to be rendered is a judicial judgment.\n The Board of Tax Appeals is not a court. It is an executive or administrative board, upon the decision of which the parties are given an opportunity to base a petition for review to the courts after the administrative inquiry of the Board has been had and decided.\n It is next suggested that there is no adequate finality provided in respect to the action of these courts. In the first place, it is not necessary, in order to constitute a judicial judgment, that there should be both a determination of the rights of the litigants and also power to issue formal execution to carry the judgment into effect, in the way that judgments for money or for the possession of land usually are enforced. A judgment is sometimes regarded as properly enforceable through the executive departments instead of through an award of execution by this Court, where the effect of the judgment is to establish the duty of the department to enforce it. La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423, 457\n, 461 S., 20 S. Ct. 168. The case of Fidelity National Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, \n274 \nU.S. 123, 132\n, 47 S. Ct. 511, shows clearly that there are instances where the award of execution is not an indispensable element of a constitutional case or controversy. In that decision there are collected familiar examples of judicial proceedings resulting in a final adjudication of the rights of litigants without it.\n But, even if a formal execution be required, we think power to resort to it is clearly shown with respect to the enforcement of the action of the courts here involved by sections 1001 to 1005.\n By the first, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals rendered after the passage of the act of 1926 may be reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals or the District Court of Appeals, if a petition for such review is filed \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 726]\n\u00a0\n either by the Commissioner or the taxpayer within six months after the decision is rendered. The courts are to adopt rules for the filing of the petition, the preparation of the record, and the conduct of the proceedings upon such review. The review is not to operate as a stay of assessment or collection of any portion of the amount of the deficiency determined by the Board, unless a petition for review is filed by the taxpayer, or unless the taxpayer has filed a bond which when enforced will operate finally to settle the rights of the parties as found by the courts.\n By section 1002 (26 USCA  1225), it is provided in what venue the decision may be reviewed. In section 1003 (26 USCA  1226), the Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Court of Appeals of the District are given exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Board, and it is declared that their judgments shall be final, except that they shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, on certificate or by certiorari in the manner provided in section 240 of the Judicial Code as amended (28 USCA  347), and in such review the courts shall have the power to affirm, or, if the decision of the Board is not in accordance with law, to modify or reverse the decision of the Board, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may require.\n By section 1004 (26 USCA  1227), the same courts are given power to impose damages in any case where the decision of the Board is affirmed, and it appears that the petition was filed merely for delay.\n By section 1005 (26 USCA  1228), the decision of the Board is to become final in respect to all the numerous instances which in the course of the review may naturally end further litigation. In the provisions of these sections, the legislation prescribes minute details for the enforcement of the judgments that are the result of these petitions for review in the several courts vested with jurisdiction over them. \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 727]\n\u00a0\n The complete purpose of Congress to provide a final adjudication in such proceedings, binding all the parties, is manifest, and demonstrates the unsoundness of the objection.\n We have before us, however, for actual inquiry a case different from one just considered in the regular course of a petition for review of a decision of the Board, begun and decided all after the enactment of the act of 1926. It is one in which the appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals had been taken, but the appeal had not been decided by the Board before the passage of the act of 1926. That presents what involves a troublesome exception or duplication in the procedure. This occurs because of the last excepting clause of section 283(b) of the amending act of 1926 (26 USCA  1064(b), which is as follows:\n'If before the enactment of this Act any person has appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals under subdivision (a) of Section 274 of the Revenue Act of 1924 ... and the appeal is pending before the Board at the time of the enactment of this Act, the Board shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. In all such cases the powers, duties, rights, and privileges of the Commissioner and of the person who has brought the appeal, and the jurisdiction of the Board and of the courts, shall be determined, and the computation of the tax shall be made, in the same manner as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, except as provided in subdivision (j) of this section and except that the person liable for the tax shall not be subject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 284.'\n\n The provisions of section 284(d); 26 USCA  1065(d) are those which deny to the taxpayer the power to bring any suit for the recovery of the tax after he has adopted the procedure of appealing to the Board of Tax Appeals or to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n By this last exception in 283(b), there seems still open to the taxpayers who have filed a petition under the \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 728]\n\u00a0\n law of 1924 and have not had a decision by the Board before the enactment of the law of 1926, the right to pay the tax and sue for a refund in the proper District Court (paragraph 20 of section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended by section 1310(c), c. 136, 42 Stat. 311, U. S. Code, title 28,  41; 28 USCA  41(20). Emery v. United States (D. C.) 27 F.(2d) 992, and Old Colony R. Co. v. United States (D. C.) 27 F.(2d) 994, hold that the petitioner still retains this earlier remedy.\n The truth seems to be that, in making provision to render conclusive judgments on petitions for review in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, Congress was not willing in cases where the Board of Tax Appeals had not decided the issue before the passage of the act of 1926 to cut off the taxpayer from paying the tax and suing for a refund in the proper District Court. But the apparent conflict in such cases can be easily resolved by the use of the principles of res judicata. If both remedies are pursued, the one in a District Court for refund, and the other on a petition for review in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgment which is first rendered will then put an end to the questions involved, and in effect make all proceedings in the other court of no avail. Whichever judgment is first in time is necessarily final to the extent to which it becomes a judgment. There is no reason, therefore, in the case before us to decline to take jurisdiction. See Bryar v. Campbell, \n177 \nU.S. 649\n, 20 S. Ct. 794; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 230\n, 43 S. Ct. 79, 24 A. L. R. 1077; Stanton v. Embry, \n93 U.S. 548\n, 554.\n Second. The jurisdiction here is based upon the certificate of a question of law. That is whether the payment by the employer of the income taxes assessed against the employee constitutes additional returnable taxable income to such employee. The certification of such a question by the Circuit Court of Appeals is an invocation \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 729]\n\u00a0\n of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and therefore within the Constitution.\n Third. Coming now to the merits of this case, we think the question presented is whether a taxpayer, having induced a third person to pay his income tax or having acquiesced in such payment as made in discharge of an obligation to him, may avoid the making of a return thereof and the payment of a corresponding tax. We think he may not do so. The payment of the tax by the employers was in consideration of the services rendered by the employee, and was again derived by the employee from his labor. The form of the payment is expressly declared to make no difference. Section 213, Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1065. It is therefore immaterial that the taxes were directly paid over to the government. The discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed. The certificate shows that the taxes were imposed upon the employee, that the taxes were actually paid by the employer, and that the employee entered upon his duties in the years in question under the express agreement that his income taxes would be paid by his employer. This is evidenced by the terms of the resolution passed August 3, 1916, more than one year prior to the year in which the taxes were imposed. The taxes were paid upon a valuable consideration, namely, the services rendered by the employee and as part of the compensation therefor. We think, therefore, that the payment constituted income to the employee.\n This result is sustained by many decisions. Providence & Worcester R. R. Co., 5 B. T. A. 1186; Houston Belt & Terminal Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 6 B. T. A. 1364; West End Street Railway Co. v. Malley (C. C. A.) 246 F. 625; Rensselaer & S. R. Co. v. Irwin (C. C.

W. 941; Estate of Irwin, 196 Cal. for services, even though entirely voluntary,\n Nor can it be argued that the payment of the tax in No. 130 was a gift. The payment for services, even though entirely yoluntary, was nevertheless compensation within the statute. This is shown by the case of Noel v. Parrott (C. C. A.) 15 F.(2d) 669. There it was resolved that a gratuitous appropriation equal in amount to $3 per share on the outstanding stock of the company be set aside out of the assets for distribution to certain officers and employees of the company, and that the executive committee be authorized to make such distribution as they deemed wise and proper. The executive committee gave $35,000 to be paid to the plaintiff taxpayer. The court said (page 672 of 15 F.(2d)):\n'In no view of the evidence, therefore, can the $35,000 be regarded as a gift. It was either compensation for services rendered or a gain or profit derived from the sale of the stock of the corporation, or both; and, in any view, it was taxable as income.'\n\n It is next argued against the payment of this tax that, if these payments by the employer constitute income to the employee, the employee will be called upon to pay the tax imposed upon this additional income, and that the payment of the additional tax will create further income which will in turn be subject to tax, with the result that there would be a tax upon a tax. This, it is urged, is the result of the government's theory, when carried to its \n\n[279 U.S. 716, 731]\n\u00a0\n logical conclusion, and results in an absurdity which Congress could not have contemplated.\n In the first place, no attempt has been made by the Treasury to collect further taxes, upon the theory that the payment of the additional taxes creates further income, and the question of a tax upon a tax was not before the Circuit Court of Appeals, and has not been certified to this Court. We can settle questions of that sort when an attempt to impose a tax upon a tax is undertaken, but not now. United States v. Sullivan, \n274 \nU.S. 259, 264\n, 47 S. Ct. 607, 51 A. L. R. 1020; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 \nU.S. 217, 219\n, 33 S. Ct. 40. It is not, therefore, necessary to answer the argument based upon an algebraic formula to reach the amount of taxes due. The question in this case is, 'Did the payment by the employer of the income taxes assessable against the employee constitute additional taxable income to such employee?' The answer must be 'Yes.'\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n The Board of Tax Appeals belongs to the executive department of the government and performs administrative functions-the assessment of taxes. The statute attempts to grant a broad appeal to the courts, and directs them to reconsider the Board's action-to do or to say what it should have done. This enjoins the use of executive power, not judicial. The duty thus imposed upon the courts is wholly different from that which arises upon the filing of a petition to annul or enforce the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Federal Trade Commission.\n I think the Circuit Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nORIEL v.

They were heard together.\n In the Oriel Case, the order, the breach of which led to the commitment, was against Oriel and Confino, directing them to turn over to their trustee in bankruptcy their books for the year 1925. The turnover order was made upon the report of the referee, October 22, 1926. The books directed to be turned over were a ledger, a purchase book and journal, a cash book and a time book. The petition was filed in August, 1926, the order to turn over granted October 22, 1926, and the order of commitment appealed from was entered March 8, 1927. The excuse offered by the bankrupts for noncompliance was that the books were not in their possession and had not been since they moved from one store to another in January, 1926, before the bankruptcy. It appeared that the only books which were missing were the books of 1925. These were necessary to sustain the entries in the books in 1926, showing the basis for the figures for the books of that critical year. The court discredited the excuse of inability to comply. There was conflicting evidence, but, after an extended hearing, the referee found that the books of account were with the bankrupts or under their control. No appeal was taken from the turnover order, and, after a failure to comply therewith, a motion followed for an order of contempt which committed them to jail, thereto be confined and detained until they purged themselves. On the motion to commit, the bankrupts attempted to introduce evidence on the issue whether at the time of the turnover order they had the books in their possession or under their control. The referee and the District Court refused to retry that issue on the ground that the turnover order could not be collaterally attacked. 17 F.(2d) 800. No attempt was made by the bankrupts to show that there was any change in respect to \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n the custody of the books after the turnover order. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the action of the District Court. 23 F.(2d) 409.\n In the Prela Case, the bankrupt was directed to turn over to his trustees merchandise and money amounting in all to about $10,000. An appeal from the turnover order was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Failure to comply resulted in a contempt order similar to that in the Oriel Case. 23 F.(2d) 413. It was attempted to introduce in the Prela Case, as it had been in the Oriel Case, evidence to show that the original turnover order was wrong, and witnesses were called who had been available at the original hearing but had not then been subpoenaed.\n The cases are brought here on the ground of error in the District Court in holding that the turnover order could not be collaterally attacked, and that the only evidence which was relevant on the motion to commit for contempt was evidence tending to show that, since the turnover order, circumstances had happened disclosing the inability of the bankrupts to comply with the order. It was urged that a finding of contempt required a greater weight of evidence than a turnover order, and hence that the former could not be predicated upon the latter without a re- examination of all the evidence. These rulings present the question before us.\n We think a proceeding for a turnover order in bankruptcy is one the right to which should be supported by clear and convincing evidence. The charge upon which the order is asked is that the bankrupt, having possession of property which he knew should have been delivered by him to the trustees, refuses to comply with his obligation in this regard. It is a charge equivalent to one of fraud, and must be established by the same kind of evidence required in a case of fraud in a court of equity. A mere preponderance of evidence in such a case is not enough. \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 363]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding is one in which coercive methods by imprisonment are probable and are foreshadowed. The referee and the court in passing on the issue under such a turnover motion should therefore require clear evidence of the justice of such an order before it is made. Being made, it should be given weight in the future proceedings as one that may not be collaterally attacked by an effort to try over the issue already heard and decided at the turnover. Thereafter on the motion for commitment the only evidence that can be considered is the evidence of something that has happened since the turnover order was made showing that since that time there has newly arisen an inability on the part of the bankrupt to comply with the turnover order.\n The proceedings in these two cases have been so long drawn out by efforts on the part of the bankrupts to retry the issue presented on the motion to turn over as to be, of themselves, convincing argument that, if the bankruptcy statute is not to be frittered away in constant delays and failures of enforcement of lawful orders, the rule we have laid down is the proper one.\n The decision of the court in the case of Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 442\n, 31 S. Ct. 492 (55 L. Ed. 797, 34 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 874), and the discussion of Mr. Justice Lamar in that case, leave no doubt that a motion to commit the bankrupt for failure to obey an order of the court to turn over to the receiver in bankruptcy the property of the bankrupt is a civil contempt and is to be treated as a mere step in the proceedings to administer the assets of the bankrupt as provided by law, and in aid of the seizure of those assets and their proper distribution. While in a sense they are punitive, they are not mere punishment-they are administrative but coercive, and intended to compel, against the reluctance of the bankrupt, performance by him of his lawful duty. \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n With reference to the character or degree of proof in establishing a civil fraud, the authorities are quite clear that it need not be beyond reasonable doubt, because it is a civil proceeding. Lalone v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 255, 257\n, 17 S. Ct. 74 (41 L. Ed. 425); United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 241\n, 17 S. Ct. 809 (42 L. Ed. 144); 5 Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed. 1923)  2498, 2, 3, and the cases cited. The Court ought not to issue an order lightly or merely on a preponderance of the evidence, but only after full deliberation and satisfactory evidence, with the understanding that it is rendering a judgment which is only to be set aside on appeal or some other form of review, or upon a properly supported petition for rehearing in the same court.\n A turnover order must be regarded as a real and serious step in the bankruptcy proceedings, and should be promptly followed by commitment, unless the bankrupt can show a change of situation after the turnover order relieving him from compliance. There is a possibility, of course, of error and hardship, but the conscience of judges in weighing the evidence under a clear perception of the consequences, together with the opportunity of appeal and review, if properly taken, will restrain the courts from recklessness of bankrupt's rights on the one hand and prevent the bankrupt from flouting the law on the other. The cases on this subject are legion, with varying views, but the following seem to us to lay down more nearly the correct view: Toplitz v. Walser (C. C. A.) 27 F. (2d) 196; Epstein v. Steinfeld (C. C. A.) 210 F. 236; Schmid v. Rosenthal (C. C. A.) 230 F. 818; Frederick v. Silverman (C. C. A.) 250 F. 75; Reardon v. Pensoneau (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 244; United States ex rel. Paleais v. Moore ( C. C. A.) 294 F. 852; In re Frankel (D. C.) 184 F. 539; Drakeford v. Adams, 98 Ga. 722, 25 S. E. 833; Collier, Bankruptcy, 652 (Gilbert's Ed. 1927).\n There are contempt cases where, under a decree for alimony, it is necessary to resort to coercive measures to secure compliance, and the issue of fact arises as to the \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n ability of the contemnor to pay what is owing. The rules of evidence are much the same as here laid down for bankruptcy. Smiley v. Smiley, 99 Wash. 577, 169 P. 962; Barton v. Barton, 99 Kan. 727, 163 P. 179; Ex parte Von Gerzabek, 58 Cal.

A. 1917C, 89.\n The conclusive effect in a proceeding of this sort of an order of 'turnover' finds its analogy in the inquiry in contempt proceedings for violating an injunction issued by a court of general jurisdiction. Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181\n, 42 S. Ct. 277; Huttig Sash Co. v. Fuelle (C. C.) 143 F. 363; People ex rel. Cauffman v. Van Buren, 136 N. Y. 252, 32 N. E. 775, 20 L. R. A. 446; Hamlin v.

R. 1422\n\n\n A number of cases can be found in the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeal and the District Courts indicating a hesitation and great reluctance to issue orders of commitment where there be any reasonable doubt of the ability of the bankrupt to comply with the turnover order. Kirsner v. Taliaferro (C. C. A.) 202 F. 51; Stuart v. Reynolds (C. C. A.) 204 F. 709; In re Haring (D. C.) 193 F. 168. We think it would be going too far to adopt the severer rule of criminal cases and would render the bankruptcy system less effective. We find ourselves in general accord on this subject with the remarks of the late Circuit Judge McPherson, of the Third Circuit, who used the following language in the case of In re Epstein (D. C.) 206 F. 568:\n'In the case in hand the consequence is, that, as the order to pay or deliver stands without sufficient reply, it \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n remains what it has been from the first-an order presumed to be right, and therefore an order that ought to be enforced. In the pending case, or in any other, the court may believe the bankrupt's assertion that he is not now in possession or control of the money or the goods, and in that event the civil inquiry is at an end; but it is also true that the assertion may not be believed, and the bankrupt may therefore be subjected to the usual pressure that follows willful disobedience of a lawful command, namely, the inconvenience of being restrained of his liberty. No doubt this may be unpleasant; it is intended to be unpleasant, but I see no reason why the proceeding should be condemned, as if it interfered with the liberty of the citizen without sufficient reason or excuse. I have known a brief confinement to produce the money promptly, thus justifying the court's incredulity, and I have also known it to fail. Where it has failed, and where a reasonable interval of time has supplied the previous defect in the evidence, and has made sufficiently certain what was doubtful before, namely the bankrupt's inability to obey the order, he has always been released, and I need hardly say that he would always have the right to be released as soon as the fact becomes clear that he cannot obey. Actual or virtual imprisonment for debt has ceased, but imprisonment to compel obedience to a lawful judicial order (if it appear that obedience is being willfully refused) has not yet ceased, and ought not to cease, unless it should be thought expedient to destroy all respect for the courts by stripping them of power to enforce their lawful decrees.'\n\n In the two cases before us, the contemnors had ample opportunity in the original hearing to be heard as to the fact of concealment, and in the motion for the contempt to show their inability to comply with the turnover order. They did not succeed in meeting the burden which was necessarily theirs in each case, and we think, there- \n\n[278 U.S. 358, 367]\n\u00a0\n fore, that the orders of the Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming the judgments of the District Court were the proper ones.\n The judgments are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAMPANGA SUGAR MILLS v. TRINIDAD(1929)\nNo. 325\nArgued: March 1, 1929Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Titus, of Washington, D. C., Quintin Paredes and Felipe Buencamino, Jr., both of Manila, Philippine Islands, and Oscar Sutro, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pampanga Sugar Mills, the plaintiff below, was the owner and operator of a sugar mill in the Philippine Islands. The business of the corporation consisted of milling sugar cane grown on lands owned and operated by others. The cane was delivered to the corporation by its owners under milling contracts which provided that the corporation should receive, as compensation for milling, one-half of the resulting centrifugal sugar, the other half going to the owners of the cane. The half received by the corporation was sold from time to time in the ordinary course of trade. Upon sales so made in 1920, 1921 and 1922 a tax was assessed as on merchants' sales under section 1459 and section 1460 of Act No. 2711 of the Philippine Legislature, known as the Administrative Code of 1917. Trinidad, the defendant below, was the then collector of internal revenue of the Islands. The tax, which was 1 per cent. on the sales value of the sugar so produced and sold by the corporation, amounted to 60,911.42 pesos.\n The corporation claimed that its operations were not within the purview of the statute, paid the tax under protest, and then brought this suit in the court of first instance at Manila to recover the amount. The question presented was one solely of statutory construction. Is the corporation a merchant within the meaning of the law? The pertinent provisions of the statute are these:\n'Sec. 1459. Percentage tax on merchants' sales.-All merchants not herein specifically exempted shall pay a tax of one per centum on the gross value in money of the commodities, goods, wares, and merchandise sold, bar- \n\n[279 U.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n tered, exchanged, or consigned abroad by them, such tax to be based on the actual selling price or value of the things in question at the time they are disposed of or consigned, whether consisting of raw material or of manufactured or partially manufactured products, and whether of domestic or foreign origin. The tax upon things consigned abroad shall be refunded upon satisfactory proof of the return thereof to the Philippine Islands unsold. ...\n\n\"Merchant,' as here used, means a person engaged in the sale, barter, or exchange of personal property of whatever character. Except as specially provided, the term includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own production and commission merchants having establishments of their own for the keeping and disposal of goods of which sales or exchanges are effected, but does not include merchandise brokers.\n\n'Sec. 1460. Sales not subject to merchants' tax.-In computing the tax above imposed transactions in the following commodities shall be excluded:\n\n'(a) Things subject to a specific tax,\n\n'(b) Agricultural products when sold by the producer or owner of the land where grown, or by any other person other than the merchant or commission merchant, whether in their original state or not.'\n\n The trial court denied relief. Its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the Islands under the following circumstances. The case was argued three times and was before the court for three years. Throughout the period one judge was disqualified and the remaining eight were equally divided. Under section 138 of the Philippine Administrative Code of 1917 the concurrence of five judges is necessary for the pronouncement of a judgment where there is no vacancy in the court; and the amount in controversy exceeds 10,000 pesos. Thus, \n\n[279 U.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n in this case, the equal division of the appellate court did not operate as an affirmance of the judgment below. Finally, one of the four, who had been consistently of the opinion that the corporation was not subject to the tax, changed his vote and voted with the four who thought the tax had been collected legally. He wrote, at the time of doing so, an opinion in which he stated that he still adhered to his original belief and that he changed his vote solely in order to break the deadlock, and thereby enable the corporation to apply to this Court for a review. A writ of certiorari was granted. \n278 \nU.S. 590\n, 46 S. Ct. 28, 73 L. Ed. -. As the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, there is jurisdiction under section 7 of the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 940, 28 USCA  349. We are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The corporation manufactured and sold the sugar. Section 1459 declares that 'except as specifically provided, the term (mercnants) includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own production.' The exceptions are provided in section 1460, and the corporation is not relieved by either of them. The first is: '(a) Things subject to a specific tax.' Sugar confessedly is not. The second exception is: '(b) Agricultural products when sold by the producer or owner of the land where grown, or by any other person other than a merchant or commission merchant, whether in their original state or not.' Exception (b) affords no immunity to the corporation. Sugar cane is an 'agricultural product' and the grower would doubtless have immunity on the sale of his half of the sugar made therefrom provided he sold it himself or through some one other than a merchant (including the manufacturer) or a commission merchant. But the corporation could, in no event, have immunity on the sale of its own half of the sugar; because it is a merchant within the express terms of section 1459-and its sugar is not within either \n\n[279 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n exception made by section 1460. Such would seem to be the natural reading of the statute. To overcome it several contentions are made.\n First. It is contended that the sugar although physically manufactured by the corporation, was legally manufactured by the grower, the corporation being merely a servant hired by the grower to perform the service; that therefore the corporation is not included in the class taxed of 'manufacturers who sell articles of their own production,' and that the fact that the compensation was paid in sugar instead of in cash is immaterial. The corporation is in no sense a servant. It is an independent concern-a contractor. But even if it could be deemed a servant of the producer of the cane, this view would not aid the corporation. It is taxed not on sugar owned by the grower, but on sugar which it acquired and then sold on its own account. The nature of the transaction by which the corporation acquired the sugar is not of legal significance. The tax is solely on the sale. If the sugar be deemed to have been bought by the corporation and then sold, it was a merchant in the common acceptation of the term. If it is treated as a manufacturer of sugar for hire, it is liable under the express provision of the statute which declares that, for the purpose of the tax, the manufacturer shall be deemed a merchant.\n Second. It is contended that the clause in section 1459 that 'except as specially provided, the term (merchants) includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own production' does not mean to include all manufacturers who do so, but only those whose main business is selling what they buy. No basis is shown for imposing such a limitation upon the plain words of the statute; nor is it shown why this corporation is in respect to the sugar sold in any different position from one who manufactures sugar from cane bought for cash. A concern which sold only sugar which it had manufactured from cane which it bought for \n\n[279 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n cash would clearly be within the terms of the statute; and no reason is suggested why a concern which manufactures only sugar which it received in exchange for services-and thus acquired by barter-should not be. The corporation was as much engaged in the business of selling sugar as it was in the business of manufacturing it. If it had obtained the sugar by a purchase for cash, it would confessedly have been liable to the tax. If getting the sugar in exchange for the service performed in grinding the other half of the cane for the grower be deemed a barter, the corporation would under the terms of the statute likewise be liable.\n Third. It is contended that even if the sales by the corporation would be taxable under section 1459, if that section stood alone, they are specifically exempted by section 1460, because sugar is an 'agricultural product' and was sold by 'the producer' within clause (b), which excludes from the tax 'agricultural products when sold by the producer or owner of the land where grown, or by any other person other than a merchant or commission merchant, whether in their original state or not.' Centrifugal sugar may well be considered an agricultural product, but he who produces it is the agriculturist-the grower-not the manufacturer. That the word 'producer' is used in section 1460 in this restrictive sense is made clear by the alternative exemption granted to the 'owner of the land where grown.' In Allen v. Smith, \n173 \nU.S. 389, 399\n, 19 S. Ct. 446, 449 (43 L. Ed. 741), this court, while holding that under the particular statute before it there was no legal distinction made between 'manufacturer' and 'producer,' observed that the latter term 'is more commonly used to denote a person who raises agricultural crops and puts them in a condition for the market.'\n Fourth. It is contended that centrifugal sugar being an agricultural product, its sale is exempted from the tax by section 1460 unless made by 'a merchant or commission merchant,' and that section 1460, unlike section 1459, does not provide \n\n[279 U.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n that a manufacturer shall be deemed a merchant. There is nothing in section 1459 to suggest that the definition of merchant there given is only to obtain for that section. The two sections were parts of the same statute. They are not to be treated as unrelated enactments. In the absence of express restriction it may be assumed that a term is used throughout a statute in the same sense in which it is first defined. It is urged that if the Legislature had intended the word to have the same meaning in both sections, it would not have added 'commission merchant' in section 1460 as it had defined merchant as including commission merchant in section 1459. The fact that 'commission merchant' is repeated in section 1460, does not show that the word 'merchant' is used in the two sections with different meanings.\n Fifth. Finally the corporation urges that if it be held liable under sections 1459 and 1460 for these taxes, which were assessed and paid in 1920, 1921 and 1922, sugar centrals will hereafter be subject to double taxes; since in March, 1923, Act 3082, section 1462-an entirely different section of the Code which imposes a one per cent. tax on the gross receipts of public utilities, hotels, restaurant keepers, dress-makers and others-was amended by inserting the words 'sugar centrals.' This argument is not persuasive as to the construction to be given to the act of 1917. The amendment was enacted six years later than the act here in question and six months after this action was begun.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK v.

Beyer, of New York City, for the People of State of New York.\n Mr. Ralph Montgomery Arkush, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 240 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  347) from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirming, on the opinion of the court below (In re Thermiodyne Radio Corp ., 26 F.(2d) 713), an order of the District Court for Delaware, expunging the claim in bankruptcy of appellant, the state of New York, for unpaid taxes assessed by it against the bankrupt corporation.\n Section 181, article 9, of the Tax Law of New York (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 60), chapter 62, Laws 1909, as amended, imposes on every foreign corporation doing business in that state a tax computed upon the basis of the capital stock employed by it within the state during the first year it does business there; the amount of its stock so employed being that proportion of its total issued capital stock which its gross assets employed within the state bear to its gross assets wherever employed. In the case of stock having a par value, the tax is fixed at one-eighth of 1 per cent. of the par value of its stock so \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n employed; for stock of no par value the fee is 6 cents per share. The tax, denominated a 'license fee,' is paid but once, purports to be imposed on the corporation 'for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises or carrying on its business in such corporate or organized capacity of this state,' and the obligation to pay it is made a prerequisite to obtaining a certificate of authority from the state and to the continuance of business there. People ex rel. Griffith v. Loughman, 249 N. Y. 369, 164 N. E. 253. But the foreign corporation is permitted to transact business and make valid contracts within the state prior to payment of the tax, which of necessity cannot be computed or paid until after the first year has elapsed. The tax is evidently the complement of the organization fee, computed in like fashion on the authorized capital stock of domestic corporations by chapter 143 of the Laws of 1886. See People ex rel. Elliott-Fischer Co. v. Sohmer, 148 App. Div. 514, 132 N. Y. S. 789, affirmed 206 N. Y. 634, 99 N. E. 1115\n\n\n The bankrupt is a Delaware corporation, whose authorized capital stock consists of 250,000 shares without par value, all of which has been issued at an average price of $2.32 per share. It commenced doing business in New York in November, 1924, and its total assets were used in its business in that state during the following year. The value of its tangible assets are alleged to have been but $280,000, or about $1.12 per share, and its intangible property to have been of no value. A tax of $15, 000, computed at 6 cents per share, was assessed against it, and is the basis of the present claim.\n The rejection of the claim by the referee was upheld by the District Court on the sole ground that the tax on the bankrupt's nonpar stock at the fixed rate of 6 cents per share, without regard to its true value or the amount paid into the corporation upon its issue, infringed the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n court thought that, as the tax could not be regarded as a true admission fee imposed as a condition of entrance into the state, and the corporation was thus in a position to invoke the equal protection clause, see Hanover Ins. Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 510\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713, the invalidity of the taxing statute was established by the decision of this court in Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 45 S. Ct. 12 since foreign corporations having the same amount of business and property, both within and without the state, but with a different number of issued nonpar shares, might be required to pay a tax differing from each other and from other foreign corporations with par value stock having like property within and without the State. The Court of Appeals of New York has since reached the opposite conclusion, both as to the nature of the tax and its constitutionality. People ex rel. Griffith v. Loughman, supra.\n For present purposes we need not determine whether the tax may be sustained, because imposed as a condition of entrance into the state, for, assuming that the bankrupt corporation was within the state, and thus entitled to equal protection (Hanover Ins. Co. v. Hardings, supra, Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 417\n, 30 S. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247), we do not deem the decision in the Air-Way Case controlling, nor the tax so unreasonable or discriminatory as to deprive the bankrupt of any constitutional immunity.\n The question presented in the Air-Way Case was whether a state franchise tax imposed on a foreign corporation, based upon its total authorized nonpar shares, only a small part of which had been issued, was forbidden. In holding that the tax infringed the equal protection clause, the court was careful to point out that it was a tax computed upon the number of authorized shares of such a corporation, whether or not subscribed for or issued, and so had no relation to the value of the privilege exercised by the foreign corporation within the state, and was \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n not a reasonable measure of the tax imposed on such a privilege. And in Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, \n271 \nU.S. 50\n, 46 S. Ct. 375, 45 A. L. R. 1495, in upholding a franchise tax similar to that here involved upon a domestic corporation having nonpar shares, whose entire authorized stock had been issued, this court, in speaking of the decision in the Air-Way Case, said (page 54 of 271 U. S. (46 S. Ct. 376)):\n'While one factor in the computation of the tax was properly the proportion of the corporation's business done and property owned within the state, the other factor was the amount of its authorized capital stock, only a part of which had actually been issued. The authority to issue its capital stock was a privilege conferred by another state, and bore no relation to any franchise granted to it by the state of Ohio or to its business and property within that state. When authorized capital stock is taken as the basis of the tax, variations in the amount of the tax are obtained, according as the corporation has a large or small amount of unissued capital stock. This was held, in the Air-Way Case, to be an unconstitutional discrimination, since it resulted in a tax larger than the tax imposed on other corporations with like privileges and like business and property within the state, but with a smaller capital authorized under the laws of the state of their creation.'\n\n But the computation of the present tax is not, as in the Air-Way Case, based upon the mere authority of the corporation to issue stock, a privilege conferred by another state and not fully exercised. Instead it is calculated on the number of shares of stock actually issued and used by the corporation in carrying on its business within the state. There is no complaint of discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations and no attempt to tax property outside the state since the tax is apportioned to the property used within it. See International Shoe Co. v. Shartel (No. 579, October Term, 1928), \n279 \nU.S. 429\n, 49 S. Ct. 380, 73 L. Ed. -. So we come to different questions from any presented in the Air-Way Case: Whether issued \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n capital stock of foreign corporations may be made the basis of a franchise or license tax at a flat rate per share when apportioned to the property and business of the corporation within the state, and whether the taxing act may discriminate by placing in one class corporations having par value stock and in another corporations having stock without par value.\n\n 1. \nIt is said that the tax computed on the number of nonpar shares at a flat rate may bear little relation to the property and business of the corporation within the state and consequently corporations having like property and business within the state, but with a different nonpar capitalization, may be required to pay a different tax. But this is equally true of corporations having par value stock, even though full value be paid in on its issue. Par value and actual value of issued stock are not synonymous and there is often a wide disparity between them. Par value has long been a familiar basis of computing a franchise tax upon foreign corporations, and when otherwise unobjectionable has been repeatedly upheld by this court. See St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350\n, 35 S. Ct. 99; Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 305; Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147\n, 38 S. Ct. 295.\n We have likewise sustained a state franchise tax on foreign corporations, measured by a fixed percentage of its nonpar stock valued, as required by the statute, at $25 per share, and apportioned to the property and business of the corporation within the state. Margay Oil Corporation v. Applegate, \n273 \nU.S. 666\n, 47 S. Ct. 458; affirming State v. Margay Oil Corp., 167 Ark. 614, 269 S. W. 63; Gilliland Oil Co. v. Arkansas, \n274 \nU.S. 717\n, 47 S. Ct. 590, affirming 171 Ark. 415, 285 S. W. 16.\n The kind and number of shares with which a foreign corporation is permitted to carry on its business within the state is a part of the privilege which the state extends to it, and is a proper element to be taken into account in fixing a tax on the privilege. It may be assumed that, if the doing of business with a greater number of nonpar shares \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n is not deemed by the taxpayer to be a valuable privilege, it will reduce the number of shares as the statute permits. A state which has adopted a permissible scheme of franchise tax for domestic corporations, based on capital stock (Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, supra), has a legitimate interest in imposing a like burden on foreign corporations which it permits to carry on business there, and we can perceive no constitutional objection to its protecting that interest by such a tax where, as here, it is limited to shares actually issued, is not assailed as confiscatory, does not reach either directly or indirectly property beyond the state and does not discriminate between foreign and domestic corporations, or between foreign corporations of like organization and property.\n There is nothing in the Constitution which requires a state to adopt the best possible system of taxation. Southwestern Oil Company v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, 30 S. Ct. 496; Delaware Railroad Tax Cases, 18 Wall. 206, 231. Although permissible, a franchise tax need not be based solely on the amount of business done or property owned within the state. It may be rested on the nature of the business. ( Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra: Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S. Ct. 192; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S. Ct. 43; Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 275\n, 21 S. Ct. 128; see Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 U.S. 540\n, 562), 22 S. Ct. 431 or the particular form in which it is carried on (see Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 606\n, 10 S. Ct. 593), so long as it bears some real and reasonable relation to the privilege granted or to the protection of the interests of the state. See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, supra, at page 57 (46 S. Ct. 375).\n We think that the measurement of such a tax upon a foreign corporation at a flat rate upon its corporate stock, either par or nonpar, used within the state, is likewise reasonably related to the privilege granted by the state and to the protection of its own interest in the mainte- \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n nance of its similar policy of taxation with respect to domestic corporations, and so does not infringe any constitutional immunity.\n\n 2. \nNor is such a tax to be deemed a denial of equal protection because a different measure or method of computing the tax is applied to corporations having nonpar stock from that applied to corporations having stock of par value. In Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, supra, at page 56 (46 S. Ct. 375), it was pointed out that there were such differences between par and nonpar shares, both in their legal incidents and their actual use, and such practical difficulties in measuring a tax by the latter, except by assigning to them an artificial or fixed value or assessing them at a flat rate, as to justify the classification for purposes of franchise tax on domestic corporations. It was accordingly held that such a tax may be based on the par value of shares of corporations having par value stock, and on a fixed value assigned to nonpar shares, regardless of their actual value or the varying amounts paid in upon them.\n But these differences between the two classes of stock, and especially the difference in the rights of creditors of the two classes of corporations,1 equally justify classification and discrimination between them in fixing a franchise tax based on corporate stock of foreign corporations. The inequalities in the tax result from a classification founded upon real differences, hence the resulting \n\n[279 U.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n discrimination is not arbitrary or prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The use of nonpar stock which may be issued at any price deemed wise, at the particular time, by the directors or stockholders, see New York Stock Corporation Law (Consol.

Y. c. 59)  69; Missouri Stock Corporation Law,  5 (Laws Mo. 1921, p. 663), or in many cases for property without fixing a price, and which has no fixed or designated amount dedicated to capital or surplus respectively, makes difficult the determination of the true capital of the corporation which it is required to keep intact and the amount which any particular stockholder is bound to pay for his stock.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Martin Taylor, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n No. 251.\n\n Respondent sued petitioner in the court of first instance of Manila to recover a tax alleged to have been illegally imposed on a stock dividend. The tax was levied under Act 2833 of the Philippine Islands, approved March 7, 1919, as amended by Act 2926, March 26, 1920. The provision here involved is substantially like that in section 2(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 for the United States (39 Stat. 757), which was held invalid in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. The trial court deemed that and other decisions of this court authoritative, held the stock dividend was not income, and gave judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed to the supreme court. One of the justices was \n\n[279 U.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n disqualified because, as Attorney General, he had acted for the defendant in this case. The appeal was submitted to the court consisting of eight justices, who divided evenly. Then the case was referred to the first division, consisting of five justices. Section 138, Revised Administrative Code of 1917. The opinion of the division, four justices concurring and one dissenting, upheld the lower court, and thereupon the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment.\n There was an agreed statement of facts, the substance of which follows. Respondent is a British corporation authorized to carry on business in the Philippine Islands. In 1923, it owned stock in a domestic corporation and received a dividend of profits accruing since March 1, 1913, which was paid by the company in its shares, having a par value of 43,500 pesos. Petitioner, as collector of internal revenue, included the amount in respondent's income for 1923 and levied thereon the tax in question. Respondent paid under protest, requested petitioner to refund the amount, and, that being refused, brought this suit.\n Section 1(a) imposes an annual normal tax of 3 per cent. upon the net income of individuals, and section 1(b) provides that, in addition to such tax, there shall be levied and paid upon such income graduated surtaxes at specified rates.\n Section 2(a) provides: '... The taxable net income of a person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from salaries ... also from ... dividends ... or gains, profits and income derived from any source whatever.'\n Section 10(a) provides: 'There shall be ... paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources by every corporation ... a tax of three per centum upon such income ... including the income derived from dividends. ...' \n\n[279 U.S. 340, 343]\n\u00a0\n Section 25(a) provides: 'The term 'dividends' as used in this law shall be held to mean any distribution made or ordered to be made by a corporation ... out of its earnings or profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and payable to its shareholders, whether in cash or in stock of the corporation. ... Stock dividend shall be considered income, to the amount of the earnings or profits distributed.'\n The petitioner admits that, strictly speaking, a stock dividend is not income. But he insists, and respondent concedes, that, in the absence of constitutional restriction, such dividends may be taxed. And the parties agree that the tax in question is within the scope and intent of the statute.\n The Supreme Court held that the tax on stock dividends is a property tax and that the graduated rates infringe the provision of section 3 of the Organic Act of August 29, 1916, c. 416, 39 Stat. 545 (48 USCA  1008), which declares that the rule of taxation in the Islands shall be uniform. But in this case that point has no foundation in fact. The graduated rates are applied and imposed only upon individuals. Section 1(b). Corporations such as respondent are subject only to a flat rate of 3 per cent. Section 10(a). And that rate applied to the stock dividend produced 1,305 pesos, the tax paid. The rule of uniformity was not transgressed.\n And in support of the judgment below it is insisted that the provision imposing a tax upon stock dividends violates that clause of section 3 of the Organic Act which declares: 'That no bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall be expressed in the title of the bill.'\n Act 2833 is entitled: 'An act establishing the income tax, making other provisions relating to said tax, and amending certain sections of act numbered twenty-seven hundred and eleven.' The insular Supreme Court held \n\n[279 U.S. 340, 344]\n\u00a0\n that the subject of the act was not adequately expressed because a tax on stock dividends is one upon capital, while the title specified only the income tax. But in our opinion that is too strict a construction. Provisions in substance the same as that above quoted are found in many state constitutions. The purpose is to prevent the inclusion of incongruous and unrelated matters in the same measure and to guard against inadvertence, stealth and fraud in legislation. When bills conform to such requirements, their titles serve conveniently to apprise legislators and the public of the subjects under consideration. Courts strictly enforce such provisions in cases that fall within the reasons on which they rest. But, as freedom required or convenient for the effective exertion of the legislative power ought not unnecessarily or lightly to be interfered with, the courts disregard mere verbal inaccuracies, resolve doubts in favor of validity, and hold that, in order to warrant the setting aside of enactments for failure to comply with the rule, the violation must be substantial and plain.

St. Rep. 382; Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) p. 202 et seq.; Sutherland, Statutory Construction (2d Ed.)  111, 115-118. The Philippine income tax law was passed before our decision in Eisner v. Macomber, supra. The Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1918 (19 Stat. 756; 40 Stat. 1057), after which that measure was patterned, treated stock dividends as income. It was then well known by those giving attention to that sort of taxation that Congress treated stock dividends as taxable income. The inclusion of such distributions within the meaning of 'income' as used in taxing statutes was not calculated or likely to mislead. The title was sufficient to notify legislators and others interested that the bill might include \n\n[279 U.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n and tax stock dividends. Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 531, 116 N. E. 904, L. R. A. 1917F, 806. And that form of property was not so unrelated to the subject of the bill as expressed in the title that its inclusion was within the mischief which the quoted provision of the Organic Act was intended to prevent. The point cannot be sustained.\n In Fisher v. Trinidad, 43 Phil. 973, the insular Supreme Court held that stock dividends are not taxable as income under the act here under consideration. The opinion of the first division in this case cites that decision and states that it has become a rule of property. Respondent supports that view, argues that the shareholders and the corporation had a right to rely on that decision, and asserts that it disposes of the issues here presented.\n The question in that case arose upon demurrer to the complaint. The decision was announced October 30, 1922. Subsequently, the taxpayer withdrew his protest and the case was dismissed as moot six months before this suit was commenced. 45 Phil. 751. The even division of the eight justices and the opinion of the first division in this case make it clear that the Supreme Court itself did not consider the question of the taxability of stock dividends as income to be foreclosed. The decisions of the highest court of the Philippines on such questions are reviewable here. The doctrine of stare decisis does not apply with full force prior to decision in the court of last resort. The circumstances negative the claim that the case established any 'rule of property.' Calhoun G. M. Co. v. Ajax G. M. Co., 27 Colo. 1, 11, 59 P. 607, 50 L. R. A. 209, 83 Am. St. Rep. 17.\n Moreover, Fisher v. Trinidad merely decided that 'stock dividends' are not taxable as 'income' under the act. Petitioner does not combat that view or claim that such distributions do constitute income. The Philippine Legislature has power to lay a tax in respect of the advantage resulting to recipients from the allotment and delivery of such dividend shares. Swan Brewing Co. v. \n\n[279 U.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n Rex. (1914) A. C. 231. Respondent rightly concedes that, there being no constitutional restriction, such dividends may be taxed and that the statute discloses a purpose to tax them. The decision of this court in Eisner v. Macomber rested on constitutional provisions not applicable to the Philippine Islands.\n Respondent suggests no ground on which the judgment of the lower court can be sustained.\n No. 252.\n Respondent sued petitioner in the court of first instance of Manila to recover a tax on a stock dividend. That court held the tax valid but the Supreme Court reversed, following its decision in No. 251.\n Respondent owned capital stock in Menzi & Co., Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines. In 1923, that company paid to respondent out of profits made after March 1, 1913, a dividend in stock of the par value of 50,000 pesos. The collector included that amount in respondent's income for that year, and, by reason of such inclusion, assessed and collected from him a tax of 637.87 pesos.\n This case differs from No. 251 in that here the taxpayer is an individual subject to surtaxes on income while corporations are subject to a flat rate. The Supreme Court held that, as stock dividends do not constitute income, the tax is on property and that therefore the specified graduated rates violate the rule of uniformity. But the record does not disclose the rate at which the tax was assessed or show any facts to support the suggestion that the required equality was lacking.\n In other respects, this case is the same as No. 251.\n Judgments reversed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COM'N OF CALIFORNIA v.

Its cars are operated on tracks laid in the streets under authority of 102 franchises granted from time to time since 1886. A few were obtained from the county; the others were granted by the city.\n Seventy-three granted between November 28, 1890, and October 21, 1918, covering 113.41 miles, provide that 'the rate of fare ... shall not exceed five cents.'\n Eighteen granted between March 2, 1920, and January 21, 1928, covering 12.33 miles, provide that 'the rate of fare ... shall not be more than five cents ... except upon a showing before a competent authority having jurisdiction over rates of fare that such greater charge is justified.'\n The remaining eleven, covering 10.5 miles, were granted at various times from 1886 to 1923; none of them provides that the fare shall not exceed 5 cents; but it may be assumed that under the provisions of the other ordinances a fare of 5 cents was made applicable over all lines. Prior to the decree in this case, the basic fare charged was 5 cents.\n Maintaining that its existing rates were not sufficient to yield a reasonable return, the company, November 16, 1926, applied to the commission, for authority to increase \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n the basic fare to 7 cents in cash or 6 1\/4 cents in tokens to be furnished by the company, four for 25 cents. The commission, March 26, 1928, made a report and by an order denied the application. A petition for rehearing was denied.\n June 22, 1928, the company brought this suit to have the rates and order adjudged confiscatory and for temporary and permanent injunctions restraining the commission from enforcing them. The city intervened as party defendant. The case came on for hearing before three judges on an application for temporary injunction. U. S. C. tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380). Affidavits were submitted, a transcript of all the evidence before the commission was received, and the parties stipulated that thereon the case should be finally determined on the merits. The court found that the rates will not permit the company to earn a reasonable return and are confiscatory; and by its decree permanently enjoined the commission from enforcing them.\n The sole controversy is whether the company is bound by contract with the city to continue to serve for the fares specified in the franchises-it being conceded that the finding below respecting the inadequacy of the 5- cent fare is sustained by the evidence. Appellants contend that at all times the city had power to establish rates by agreement and that the franchise provisions constitute binding contracts that are still in force. On the other hand, the company maintains that the state never so empowered the city; and it insists that, if the power was given and any such contracts were made, they have been abrogated.\n\n 1. \nIt is possible for a state to authorize a municipal corporation by agreement to establish public service rates and thereby to suspend for a term of years not grossly excessive the exertion of governmental power by legislative action to fix just compensation to be paid for service \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n furnished by public utilities. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 382\n, 22 S.Ct. 410; Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Water Works Co., \n206 \nU.S. 496, 508\n, 515 S., 27 S. Ct. 762; Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, \n265 \nU.S. 352, 355\n, 44 S. Ct. 492. And where a city, empowered by the state so to do, makes a contract with a public utility fixing the amounts to be paid for its service, the latter may not be required to serve for less even if the specified rates are unreasonably high. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Ry. Co., supra, \n184 \nU.S. 389\n, 22 S. Ct. 410. And, in such case, the courts may not relieve the utility from its obligation to serve at the agreed rates, however inadequate they may prove to be. Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, supra.\n This court is bound by the decisions of the highest courts of the states as to the powers of their municipalities. Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 43 S. Ct. 613. Our attention has not been called to any California decision, and we think there is none, which decides that the state Legislature has empowered Los Angeles to establish rates by contract. This court is therefore required to construe the state laws on which appellants rely. As it is in the public interest that all doubts be resolved in favor of the right of the state from time to time to prescribe rates, a grant of authority to surrender the power is not to be inferred in the absence of a plain expression of purpose to that end. The delegation of authority to give up or suspend the power of rate regulation will not be found more readily than would an intention on the part of the state to authorize the bargaining away of its power to tax. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 561; Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 \nU.S. 307, 325\n, 6 S. Ct. 334, 388, 1191; Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport, \n180 \nU.S. 587, 599\n, 21 S.

Ct. 705\n\n\n This court applied the established rule in Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, \n211 \nU.S. 265\n, 29 S. Ct. 50. That com- \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n pany's franchise was granted under the Broughton Franchise Act which provided that every such franchise 'shall be granted upon the conditions in this act provided and not otherwise.' St. Cal 1901, p. 265. The city charter gave power to its council to fix charges for telephone service. The franchise stated that the rates should not exceed specified amounts. An ordinance prescribing lower rates was passed. The company brought suit for injunction against its enforcement on the ground that the ordinance violated the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. The city insisted that it had not been empowered by the state to make such a contract, and this court upheld its contention. It said (\n211 \nU.S. 273\n, 29 S. Ct. 52): 'The surrender, by contract, of a power of government, though in certain well-defined cases it may be made by legislative authority, is a very grave act, and the surrender itself, as well as the authority to make it, must be closely scrutinized. ... The general powers of a municipality or of any other political subdivision of the state are not suficient. Specific authority for that purpose is required.' And dealing with the charter provision there relied on by the company, the court said ( \n211 \nU.S. 274\n, 29 S. Ct. 52): 'The charter gave to the council the power 'by ordinance ... to regulate telephone service and the use of telephones within the city, ... and to fix and determine the charges for telephones and telephone service and connections.' This is an ample authority to exercise the governmental power ... but entirely unfitted to describe the authority to contract. It authorizes command, but not agreement.'\n Section 470 of the Civil Code (March 21, 1872), cited by appellants, merely regulates procedure. Section 497 authorizes political subdivisions to grant authority for the laying of railroads in streets 'under such restrictions and limitations' as they may provide. Stats. 1891, p. 12. This is too general. The clause in section 501 (Stats. 1903, p. 172), providing that the rate of fare in municipalities \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 154]\n\u00a0\n of the first class 'must not exceed five cents,' does not relate to the power to contract, and plainly has no application here because Los Angeles never belonged to that class.\n Section 1 of the Broughton Franchise Act1 provides that franchises 'shall be granted upon the conditions in this act provided and not otherwise.' The Act requires the sale of such franchises upon advertisement stating the character of the franchise or privilege proposed to be granted, but it nowhere expressly empowers the city to establish rates by contract. This court, in the Home Telephone Company Case, dealt with the quoted provision. It said (\n211 \nU.S. 275\n, 29 S. Ct. 53): 'Here is an emphatic caution against reading into the act act any conditions which are not clearly expressed in the act itself. ... It cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that so significant and important an authority as that of contracting away a power of regulation conferred by the charter should be inferred from the act, in the absence of a grant in express words. But there is no such grant.' And, so far as concerns the matter under consideration, the act was not expanded by the amendment of June 8, 1915 (St. Cal. 1915, p. 1300). It authorizes grantors of such franchises to impose such additional terms and con- \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 155]\n\u00a0\n ditions 'whether governmental or contractual in character' as in their judgment are in the public interest. This general language does not measure up to the rule earlier invoked here by Los Angeles and applied by this court in the Home Telephone Company Case.\n The appellants invoke provisions of the city charter which are printed in the margin. \n2\n But it requires no discussion to show that they are not sufficient to empower the city by contract to establish rates. In support of their claim, they cite Columbus Ry. & Power Co. v. Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399\n, 39 S. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648; Opelika v. Opelika Sewer Co., \n265 \nU.S. 215\n, 44 S. Ct. 517; Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, supra; and Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, \n268 \nU.S. 232\n, 45 S. Ct. 488. But the Columbus Case did not involve, and this court did not there decide, the question of power. See page 407 of 249 U. S., 39 S. Ct. 352 and Cleveland v. Cleveland City R. Co ., 194 U. S. at pages 532, 534, 24 S. Ct. 756. And, in the other cases, we followed the decisions of the courts of the respective states. \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 156]\n\u00a0\n Appellants have failed to sustain their contention that the city was empowered to make such rate contracts.\n\n 2. \nBut, assuming that the fares were established by the franchise contracts, we are of opinion that such contracts have been abrogated. The state had power upon the company's application, through its commission or otherwise, to terminate them. Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., \n250 \nU.S. 394\n, 39 S. Ct. 526; Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 \nU.S. 182, 186\n, 43 S. Ct. 534, 29 A. L. R. 1471; Henderson Water Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n269 \nU.S. 279\n, 46 S. Ct. 112; Denney v. Pacific Tel. Co., \n276 \nU.S. 97\n, 48 S. Ct. 223.\n November 30, 1918, the company applied to have the commission investigate its service and financial condition and for an order authorizing it to 'so operate its system and change its rates that the income will be sufficient to pay the costs of the service.' May 31, 1921, the commission found that the existing fares would not permit the company to collect enough to enable it to provide adequate service. See In re Los Angeles Railway Corp., P. U. R. 1922A, 66, 90. And it made an order permitting a small increase. The company did not accept it, but applied for a rehearing. After several postponements, the case was stricken from the calendar, and some years later the company asked that its application by dismissed. The commission, October 18, 1926, granted the company's request and also revoked the order.\n Shortly thereafter the company applied for a basic fare of 7 cents in cash or 6 1\/4 cents in tokens. The fares so proposed were substantially higher than those which were not accepted by the company. Again the commission made extensive investigations. And March 26, 1928, it filed a report which contained findings as to the value of the property, operating revenues, operating expenses, including cost of depreciation and taxes, amount available for return, average net income for five years ending with 1926, stated that the cost of operation might be reduced, and concluded that, by reason of such facts, the rates of fare charged by the com- \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 157]\n\u00a0\n pany were not unreasonable and that the rates proposed would be unjust and unreasonable. And the commission made an order denying the company's application.\n There is no decision in the courts of the state as to the effect of the proceedings before and action taken by the commission, and therefore we are required to construe the applicable provisions of the local Constitution and statutes. Denney v. Pacific Tel. Co., supra, \n276 \nU.S. 101\n, 48 S. Ct. 224. Under the State Constitution, art. 12,  23, as amended November 3, 1914, and the Public Utilities Act of April 23, 1915 (St. Cal. 1915, p. 115), the commission has exclusive power to regulate rates. And section 27 of the Act3 gave to street reilway companies the right to charge more than 5 cents upon showing before the commission that the higher charge is justified. No distinction is made between rates established by franchise contracts and those otherwise fixed. Fares may not be changed without approval of the commission. The policy of the state is that all rates shall be just and reasonable (section 15), and the commission is directed, whenever, after hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint it shall find that rates are unjust or insufficient, to determine the just and reasonable rates thereafter to be observed. Section 32(a).4 The language used \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 158]\n\u00a0\n in Denney v. Pacific Tel. Co., supra, 276 U. S. page 102, 48 S. Ct. 224, is pertinent here: 'The department made its investigation and order without regard to the franchise rates and treated the questions presented as unaffected thereby. It exercised the power and duty to fix reasonable and compensatory rates irrespective of any previous municipal action. We must treat the result as a bona fide effort to comply with the local statute.'\n The proceedings before the commission and its orders clearly show that it twice took jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable rates. Its order of May 31, 1921, by reason of the company's failure to put in the increased rates, never became operative, and finally was vacated. The report and order of March 26, 1928, found that existing rates were just and reasonable and in legal effect required the company to continue to observe them. The court below found the rates confiscatory, and appellants do not here question that finding.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that, as our finding that the city had no power to make rate contracts is sufficient to dispose of the case, it would be better not to take up the second point.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The railway claims that the commission's refusal to authorize a fare higher than 5 cents confiscates its property. The city and the commission do not insist here that the 5-cent fare is compensatory; and they concede that, since 1915, the latter has had jurisdiction to authorize a higher fare. They defend solely on the ground that the railway bound itself by contracts not to charge more; that these contract provisions are still in force, except as modified by the act of 1915 empowering the commission to authorize changes in the rate; \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 159]\n\u00a0\n that an alleged error of the commission in refusing authority to charge more can be corrected only be proceedings brought in the Supreme Court of the state to compel the commission to do its duty; and that the lower court's finding that the rate is noncompensatory is therefore immaterial.\n The District Court recognized that such contracts, if existing, would be a complete defense to this suit, Columbus Ry. & Power Co. v. Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399\n, 39 S. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432\n, 43 S. Ct. 613; Opelika v. Opelika Sewer Co., \n265 \nU.S. 215\n, 44 S. Ct. 517; St. Cloud Public Service Co. v. St. Cloud, \n265 \nU.S. 352\n, 44 S. Ct. 492; Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, \n268 \nU.S. 232\n, 45 S. Ct. 488; expressed a strong doubt whether the city ever had the power to contract concerning the rate of fare, and, declining to pass upon that question, granted the relief prayed for solely on the ground that any such contract right which existed had been abrogated.\n The franchises under which the railway is operating are confessedly contracts. The words used concerning the rate of fare are apt ones to express contractual obligations. The railway contends, however, that the fare provisions were not intended to be contracts, and that, if they were so intended, they were not binding, because neither the city nor the county had the power to contract as to the rate of fare. It insists, further, that, if the fare provisions were originally binding as contracts, they were abrogated in 1921 or 1928 by action of the commission.\n First. Most of the franchises were granted before the state had vested in the commission power to regulate street railway rates or had expressly reserved to itself, otherwise, the power to change rates theretofore fixed by ordinance. This power of regulation was first expressly conferren upon the commission in 1915, by amendments to sections 13, 27, and 63 of the Public Utilities Act (Stats. 1915, \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 160]\n\u00a0\n p. 115) made pursuant to an amendment of section 23 of article 12 of the California Constitution adopted November 3, 1914. These enactments did not purport to abrogate any existing contract. Nor did they purport to take from the city or from the county any power theretofore possessed to make a contract concerning the rate of fare. Their effect was merely to make any such contract, whether theretofore or thereafter entered into, subject to change by the commission. Unless and until so changed, a contractual fare fixed by franchise remains in full force. Henderson Water Co. v. Corp. Comm., \n269 \nU.S. 278, 281\n, 282 S., 46 S. Ct. 112. Consequently, it is not here claimed that these enactments alone abrogated the alleged contracts as to rate of fare.\n Second. The railway contends, however, that the commission abrogated the fare contracts by its action taken in 1921 pursuant to this legislation. The facts are these. In 1918, the railway asked the commission to make an investigation of its service and its financial condition and for an order enabling it to so operate its system that the income would be sufficient to pay the cost of the service. In that application the railway expressly disclaimed any desire to increase its rate of fare, but about two years later it made a supplemental application for leave to do so. On May 31, 1921, the commission made a report in which it declared that 'an increase in the fare in some form' should be granted, and that the railway be authorized 'to file with the commission and put into effect within thirty (30) days from the date of this order a schedule of rates increasing the present basic 5-cent fare to 6 cents,' ten tickets for 50 cents. 19 Cal. R. R. Comm. Op. 980, 1002. The railway did not file a schedule of fares. Instead, it moved for a rehearing. That motion was promptly set down for hearing by the commission, but was never heard; for the railway asked, first, for an adjournment, then that its motion be stricken \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 161]\n\u00a0\n from the calendar, and, finally, that an order be entered steeing aside the decision made and dismissing the entire proceeding, including the application for increase of fare. This request of the railway was granted, the order of dismissal reciting that the authorization to increase the fare had 'been suspended by virtue of the pendency of a petition for rehearing,' as the statutes provided. Public Utility Act,  66. Obviously this action taken in 1921 cannot be deemed an abrogation or modification of any existing fare provision of the franchises, unless it be held that mere entry by the commission upon an inquiry as to the rate of fare, as commanded by the statute, has that effect. Reason and authority are to the contrary.\n Third. Nor did the action taken by the commission in 1928, in the proceedings now under review, abrogate any existing fare provision. There also the commission took jurisdiction, as it was by the statute required to do. It refused to authorize a higher fare, because it concluded that for the past five years the railway had been earning an average annual return of 7.1 per cent; that it was not being efficiently operated; that the management had failed to introduce certain economies previously recommended which would have increased its net earnings; and that for these reasons the existing 5-cent fare was just and reasonable. The commission may have erred in its judgment, but it is clear that it did not change the rate of fare. In Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 439\n, 43 S. Ct. 613, it was held that the assumption of jurisdiction by the commission to the extent of affirmatively ordering the continuance of existing transfer privileges did not effect an abrogation of an existing contract provision relating thereto, since such action did not conflict with the terms of the contract. Compare Los Angeles v. Los Angles City Water Co., \n177 \nU.S. 558, 578\n, 584 S., 20 S. Ct. 736; Minneapolis v. Street Ry. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 417, 435\n, 30 S. Ct. 118. In Denney v. Pacific Telephone Co., \n276 \nU.S. 97\n, 48 S. Ct. 223, the commission had previ- \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 162]\n\u00a0\n ously granted an increase in fare of which the company had availed itself.\n Assuming that the railway was bound by contract to maintain a 5-cent fare, it could be relieved from its obligation only be the commission. Had the commission authorized an increase in fare, it would still be questionable whether the contract would have been thereby abrogated or only modified by making the railway's obligation less onerous. Surely the commission's refusal to grant any help, because in its opinion none is needed, cannot have the anomalous effect of entirely relieving the railway of its obligation.\n Fourth. If the District Court erred in holding that the action taken in 1921 or 1928 had the effect of abrogating any existing contract, there must be a determination whether such contracts did exist, in fact and law. It was assumed by the District Court and by counsel in this court that, if the city lacked the power to bind itself contractually by the fare provisions, the railway could not be bound thereby. This conclusion is not commanded by logic or by the law of contracts. Lack of power in the municipality to bind itself is a factor to be considered in determining whether the parties intended to enter into a contract. But, if they did, the railway's promise need not fail for lack of mutuality. The law does not require that a particular contractual obligation must be supported by a corresponding counter obligation. It is conceded that the city possessed the power to enter into the franchise contract. The contention is merely that it could not surrender its power to regulate rates. But there is nothing in the fare provisions to indicate that the city attempted to do that. These provisions in terms bind only the railway. The railway unquestionably had power to agree to charge a fixed fare. The grant of the franchise is sufficient consideration, if so intended, for any number of contractual obligations which the railway may \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 163]\n\u00a0\n have chosen to assume. In Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. Chariton, \n255 \nU.S. 539\n, 41 S. Ct. 400, a case coming from Iowa, it was held, following Iowa decisions, that, since the city lacked power to bind itself, there was no contract. And there is a statement to that effect in San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service Co., \n255 \nU.S. 547, 556\n, 41 S. Ct. 428. But in Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, \n268 \nU.S. 232, 233\n, 45 S. Ct. 488, the question was expressly left open. Obviously that is a matter of state law on which the decisions of this court are not controlling.\n Fifth. If it be true that the railway is not bound by the fare provisions, unless the city had power to bind itself in that respect, it is necessary to determine whether the city had that power and whether the parties did in fact contract as to the rate of fare. Whether the city had the power is, of course, a question of state law. In California, the Constitution and the statutes leave the question in doubt. Counsel agree that there is no decision in any court of the state directly in point. They reason from policy and analogy. In support of their several contentions they cite, in the aggregate, 30 decisions of the California courts, 15 statutes of the state, besides 3 provisions of its Code and 7 provisions of its Constitution. The decisions referred to occupy 308 pages of the official reports; the sections of the Constitution, Code and statutes, 173 pages. Moreover, the 102 franchises here involved were granted at many different times between 1886 and 1927. And during that long period there have been amendments both of relevant statutes and of the Constitution. The city or the county may have had the power to contract as to the rate of fare at one time and not at another. If it is held that the city or the county ever had the power to contract as to rate of fare, it will be necessary to examine the 102 franchises to see whether the power was exercised. It may then be that some of the franchises contain valid fare contracts, while others \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 164]\n\u00a0\n do not. In that event, the relief to be granted will involve passing also on matters of detail.\n In my opinion, these questions of statutory construction, and all matters of detail, should, in the first instance, be decided by the trial court. To that end, the judgment of the District Court should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, without costs to either party in this court. Pending the decision of the trial court, an interlocutory injunction should issue. Compare City of Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164\n, 48 S. Ct. 66; City of Hammond v. Farina Bus Line & Transportation Co., \n275 \nU.S. 173\n, 48 S. Ct. 70; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n279 \nU.S. 813\n, 49 S. Ct. 256. It is a serious task for us to construe and apply the written law of California. Compare Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 U.S. 159\n, 207-209, 49 S. Ct. 282. To 'one brought up within it, varying emphasis, tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life, may give to the different parts wholly new values that logic and grammar never could have gotten from the books.' Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 106\n, 43 S. Ct. 286, 288. This court is not peculiarly fitted for that work. We may properly postpone the irksome burden of examining the many relevant state statutes and decisions until we shall have had the aid which would be afforded by a thorough consideration of them by the judges of the District Court, who are presumably more familiar with the law of California than we are. The practice is one frequently followed by this court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 145, 165]\n\u00a0\n In the case at bar, there are persuasive reasons for adopting the course suggested. The subject-matter of this litigation is local to California. The parties are all citizens of that state and creatures of its Legislature. Since the railway denies that there ever was a valid contract governing the rate and asserts that, if any such existed they have been abrogated, the contract clause of the Federal Constitution is not involved. The alleged existence of contracts concerning the rate of fare presents \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 166]\n\u00a0\n the fundamental issue of the case. Whether such contracts exist, or ever existed, depends wholly upon the construction to be given to laws of the state. Upon these questions, the decision of the Supreme Court of California would presumably have been accepted by this court, if the case had come here on appeal from it. Compare Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 43 S. Ct. 613; Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 380\n, 46 S. Ct. 569.\n The constitutional claim of confiscation gave jurisdiction to the District Court. We may be required, therefore, to pass, at some time, upon these questions of state law. And we may do so now. But the special province of this court is the federal law. The construction and application of the Constitution of the United States and of the legislation of Congress is its most important function. In order to give adequate consideration to the adjudication of great issues of government, it must, so far as possible, lessen the burden incident to the disposition of cases which come here for review. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES joins in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I agree with Mr. Justice BRANDEIS that this case should have been disposed of by remanding it to the District Court of three judges for determination whether the railway company, under its 102 franchises, or any of them, is bound by contract to maintain a 5-cent fare. That question is I think different from the one presented in Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, \n211 \nU.S. 265\n, 29 S. Ct. 50, and \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 167]\n\u00a0\n involved in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Railway Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368\n, 22 S. Ct. 410, and Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Water Works Co., \n206 \nU.S. 496\n, 27 S. Ct. 762, whether the city had the requisite legislative authority to bind itself not to reduce the rate of fare fixed by the franchise. Here concededly the power to regulate rates is reserved to the state commission, and the question preliminary to the whole case is whether the railroad company has bound itself to serve for a 5-cent fare. I know of no principle of the law of contracts, qua contracts, which would preclude its doing so, even though the city had no power to obligate itself to maintain any particular rate. It has not purported to exercise such power by so contracting. It had power to grant franchises, and the grant of the franchise without more would be good consideration for the company's undertaking to maintain a 5-cent fare. Williston on Contracts,  13, 140.\n The provision of the statute of April 7, 1913, enacted after the decision in Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, supra, authorizing the city to grant franchises and 'to prescribe the terms and conditions' of the grant, and that of the act of June 8, 1915 (St. Cal. 1915, p. 1300), authorizing the grantor of the franchise to impose terms and conditions 'whether governmental or contractual in character,' to quote no others, would seem to permit the city to acquire by the mere grant of the franchise, without other obligation on its part, such contractual undertakings on the part of the railroad company as did not contravene the public interest.\n If there be any public policy forbidding the company so to bind itself or forbidding the city to take advantage of the undertaking so given and acquired, it is one peculiar to local law, having its origin in local history and conditions, and so is peculiarly an appropriate subject for consideration, in the first instance, by the court of the district. \n\n[280 U.S. 145, 168]\n\u00a0\n But as the court, without dealing with this aspect of the matter, has held that the railway company is not so bound, it is unnecessary to decide that the State Railroad Commission's refusal to raise the rate would have been enough to abrogate the contract, if there had been one, and the practice of the court not to pass on questions of constitutional or state law not necessary to a decision should, I think, be scrupulously observed. Even if necessary to decide the question, I would not be prepared to say that the refusal of the commission to fix a fare different from the contract rate would destroy the contract. By contracting for a 5-cent fare, the railway company waived the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Columbus Ry. Co. v. Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399\n, 39 S.

Stats. Cal. 1893, p. 288. The act was amended in 1897 (Stats. 1897, pp. 135, 177), re-enacted in 1901 (Stats. 1901, p. 265) and 1905 (Stats. 1905, p. 777), and amended in 1909 (Stats 1909, p. 125).

McIlvaine, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent executor brought suit in the District Court for Northern Illinois to recover from petitioner, a collector of internal revenue, the amount of a tax alleged to have been illegally assessed and collected upon the estate of respondent's testator under the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227. Judgment of the district court for the executor, upon an overruled demurrer, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 24 F. (2d) 91. This court granted certiorari April 23, 1928, \n277 \nU.S. 579\n, 48 S. Ct. 436.\n Respondent's testator died May 30, 1922. On various dates between 1903 and 1919 he established seven trusts by deed which are conceded not to have been in contemplation of death. Two of them were created respectively in 1903 and 1910. They are identified in the record as trusts No. 1831 and No. 3048, and referred to here as the 'two trusts.' By them the income from the trusts was reserved to the settlor for life and on his death the income of each trust was to be paid to a designated person until the termination of the trust as provided in the trust instrument, with remainders over. By the terms of each trust there was reserved to the settlor alone a power of revocation of the trusts, upon the exercise of which the trustee was required to return the corpus of the trust to him.\n The remaining five trusts, designated in the record as trusts Nos. 4477, 4478, 4479, 4480 and 4481, referred to here as the 'five trusts,' were created in 1919 before the passage of the Revenue Act of 1921, but after the enact- \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n ment of the similar provisions of the estate tax of the Revenue Act of 1918. 40 Stat. 1096, 1097. By each, life interests in the income, on terms not now important were created. In one the life interest was terminable five years after the death of the settlor or on the death of the designated life beneficiary should she survive that date, with a remainder over. In the other four, life interests in the income were created, terminable five years after the settlor's death or on the death of the respective life tenants, whichever should first happen, with remainders over. The settlor reserved to himself power to supervise the reinvestment of trust funds, to require the trustee to execute proxies, to his nominee, to vote any shares of stock held by the trustee, to control all leases executed by the trustee, and to appoint successor trustees. With respect to each of these five trusts a power was also reserved 'to alter, change or modify the trust,' which was to be exercised in the case of four of them by the settlor and the single beneficiary of each trust, acting jointly, and in the case of one of the trusts, by the settlor and a majority of the beneficiaries named, acting jointly.\n The settlor died without having revoked either of the two trusts and with the beneficiaries and life tenants designated in the trusts surviving him, and without having modified any of the five trusts except one, and that in a manner not now material.\n The commissioner, in fixing the amount of the estate for tax purposes included the corpus of all seven trusts. Section 401 of the statute imposes a tax at a graduated rate 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent' dying after the passage of the act. By section 402 it is provided that in calculating the tax there shall be included in the gross estate all property, tangible and intangible, '(c) to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contem- \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n plation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act). ...'\n As to the two trusts, it is argued that since they were created long before the passage of any statute imposing an estate tax the taxing statute if applied to them is unconstitutional and void, because retroactive, within the ruling of Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081. In that case it was held that the provisions of the similar section 402 of the 1918 act, 40 Stat. 1097, making it applicable to trusts created before the passage of the act was in conflict with the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and void as respects transfers completed before any such statute was enacted. But in No. 77, Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 73 L. Ed. -, decided this day, the decision is rested on the ground, earlier suggested with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment in Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, that a transfer made subject to a power of revocation in the transferor, terminable at his death, is not complete until his death. Hence section 402, as applied to the present transfers, is not retroactive since his death follows the passage of the statute. For that reason, stated more at length in our opinion in Chase National Bank v. United States, supra, we hold that the tax was rightly imposed on the transfers of the corpus of the two trusts and as to them the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.\n It is argued by respondent that section 402 by its terms does not impose any tax on the transfers involved in the five trusts and that, even if subject to the provisions of that section, they antedated the passage of the 1921 act, and the section as to them is retroactive and void, although they were created after the enactment of the corresponding sections of the 1918 act. The government argues that section 402 applies to all these transfers and is not retroactive \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 346]\n\u00a0\n as to them because of the reserved powers to manage and to modify the trusts, which did not terminate until the death of the decedent after the passage of the statute, and that even without such reserved powers the transfers of the remainder interests were all subject to the tax because, within the language of section 402, they were 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death.'\n As the tax cannot be supported unless the statute applies in one of the two ways suggested by the government we must necessarily determine the effect of the reserved powers and the meaning and application of the phrase quoted from section 402. If it be assumed that the power to modify the trust was broad enough to authorize disposition of the trust property among new beneficiaries or to revoke the trusts, still it was not one vested in the settlor alone, as were the reserved powers in the case of the two trusts. He could not effect any change in the beneficial interest in the trusts without the consent, in the case of four of the trusts, of the person entitled to that interest, and in the case of one trust without the consent of a majority of those so entitled. Since the power to revoke or alter was dependent on the consent of the one entitled to the beneficial, and consequently adverse, interest, the trust, for all practical purposes, had passed as completely from any control by decedent which might inure to his own benefit as if the gift had been absolute.\n Nor did the reserved powers of management of the trusts save to decedent any control over the economic benefits or the enjoyment of the property. He would equally have reserved all these powers and others had he made himself the trustee, but the transfer would not for that reason have been incomplete. The shifting of the economic interest in the trust property which was the subject of the tax was thus complete as soon as the trust was \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 347]\n\u00a0\n made. His power to recall the property and of control over it for his own benefit then ceased and as the trusts were not made in contemplation of death, the reserved powers do not serve to distinguish them from any other gift inter vivos not subject to the tax.\n But the question much pressed upon us remains whether, the donor having parted both with the possession and his entire beneficial interest in the property when the trust was created, the mere passing of possession or enjoyment of the trust fund from the life tenants to the remaindermen after the testator's death, as directed, and after the enactment of the statute, is included within its taxing provisions. That question, not necessarily involved, was left unanswered in Shukert v. Allen, \n273 \nU.S. 545\n, 47 S. Ct. 461, 49 A. L. R. 855. There the gift of a remainder interest, having been made without reference to the donor's death, although it did in fact vest in possession and enjoyment after his death, was held not to be a transfer intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the donor's death, and for that reason not to be subject to the tax. But here the gift was intended to so take effect, although the transfer which effected it preceded the death of the settlor and was itself not subject to the tax unless made so by the circumstance that the possession or enjoyment passed as indicated.\n In its plan and scope the tax is one imposed on transfers at death or made in contemplation of death and is measured by the value at death of the interest which is transferred. Cf. Y. M. C. A. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 44 S. Ct. 291; Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 62\n, 44 S. Ct. 293; N. Y. Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 349\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660. It is not a gift tax and the tax on gifts once imposed by the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 313, has been repealed, 44 Stat. 126. One may freely give his property to another by absolute gift without subjecting himself or his estate to a tax, but we \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 348]\n\u00a0\n are asked to say that this statute means that he may not make a gift inter vivos, equally absolute and complete, without subjecting it to a tax if the gift takes the form of a life estate in one with remainder over to another at or after the donor's death. It would require plain and compelling language to justify so incongruous a result and we think it is wanting in the present statute.\n It is of significance, although not conclusive, that the only section imposing the tax, section 401, does so on the net estate of decedents and that the miscellaneous items of property required by section 402 to be brought into the gross estate for the purpose of computing the tax, unless the present remainders be an exception, are either property transferred in contemplation of death or property passing out of the control, possession or enjoyment of the decedent at his death. They are property held by the decedent in joint tenancy or by the entirety, property of another subject to the decedent's power of appointment and insurance policies effected by the decedent on his own life, payable to his estate or to others at his death. The two sections read together indicate no purpose to tax completed gifts made by the donor in his lifetime not in contemplation of death, where he has retained no such control, possession or enjoyment. In the light of the general purpose of the statute and the language of section 401 explicitly imposing the tax on net estates of decedents, we think it at least doubtful whether the trusts or interests in a trust intended to be reached by the phrase in section 402(c) 'to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' include any others than those passing from the possession, enjoyment or control of the donor at his death and so taxable as transfers at death under section 401. That doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Ct. 53; United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 44 S. Ct. 69, 29 A. L. R. 1547. Doubts of the constitutionality of the statute, if construed as contended by the government, \n\n[278 U.S. 339, 349]\n\u00a0\n would require us to adopt the construction, at least reasonably possible here, which would uphold the act.

LATHROP(1929)\nNo. 155\nArgued: Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 509, 510]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles J. Staples,, Frederick G. Mitchell, William Doran Cushman, and Wm. P. Conley, all of Buffalo, N. Y., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joshua R. H. Potts, and Eugene Vincent Clarke, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here to be determined arose in a suit in equity by respondent against petitioner, brought in the federal District Court for the Western District of New York, for infringement of a patent. The bill alleged repeated and continuing infringement of the patent by petitioner, preparation and readiness to continue such infringement, and that, unless petitioner was restrained, respondent would suffer great and irreparable damage, etc. \n\n[278 U.S. 509, 511]\n\u00a0\n It was further alleged that, in a prior suit for infringement, brought by respondent against the Bowman Dairy Company, the patent had been sustained as valid and infringed; that the defense to that suit was openly conducted by petitioner, who paid all expenses, as well as the judgment rendered by the final decree; that such decree, therefore, became res judicata as against petitioner. The prayer was for an interlocutory as well as a perpetual injunction, and for an account to be taken of profits realized by petitioner and damages sustained by respondent.\n At the time suit was brought, only 41 or 42 days remained before the expiration of the patent. Two days after beginnig suit, respondent moved for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing upon affidavits, the motion was denied. The court thought no injury would result to respondent by a refusal to grant the injunction at that time, that infringement had ceased, that the responsibility of petitioner was unquestioned, and that the recovery of damages would be a sufficient protection for past infringement. Subsequently a motion by petitioner to transfer the case to the law side of the court was made and denied. The grounds for the denial were stated in an opinion by the District Judge (6 F.(2d) 91), in the course of which he said:\n'In the circumstances, plaintiff had a right, at the time this action was instituted, to commence in equity and to assert that right to an injunction existed ... I must therefore hold that the relief sought in the bill was grantable, and it was only denied by the court in the exercise of its discretion. ...'\n\n The case was then proceeded with as a suit in equity. Before the trial was entered upon, the patent in the meantime having expired, petitioner renewed its motion to transfer to the law docket, which was again denied. The \n\n[278 U.S. 509, 512]\n\u00a0\n trial resulted in a decree for respondent, holding the patent to be valid and infringed (21 F.(2d) 124), and this decree was affirmed by the court below on appeal without opinion (24 F.(2d) 1021).\n The sole question for our consideration is whether, after refusing the preliminary injunction, the District Court was justified in retaining jurisdiction of the case as a suit in equity. We allowed the writ and brought the case here because of an alleged conflict in respect of that matter among the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals.\n The question is very nearly set at rest by Clark v. Wooster, \n119 \nU.S. 322\n, 7 S. Ct. 217. There suit was brought to restrain a patent infringement and to recover profits and damages. The patent involved expired 15 days after the bill was filed. It did not appear whether an application for an interlocutory injunction was made, but under the rules of the court there was time before the expiration of the patent within which it could have been made. The final decree established the patent and its infringement, and a reference was made to a master to take and state an account. The jurisdiction of the trial court sitting as a court of equity was challenged. This court sustained the jurisdiction and held that it was within the discretion of the trial court under the circumstances to retain the bill as it did. The opinion then proceeds ( page 325 of 119 U. S. (7 S. Ct. 218)):\n'It might have dismissed the bill, if it had deemed it inexpedient to grant an injunction; but that was a matter in its own sound discretion, and with that discretion it is not our province to interfere, unless it was exercised in a manner clearly illegal. We see no illegality in the manner of its exercise in this case. The jurisdiction had attached, and although, after it attached, the principal ground for issuing an injunction may have ceased to exist by the expiration of the patent, yet there might be other grounds for the writ arising from the possession by the defendants of folding guides illegally made or procured whilst the \n\n[278 U.S. 509, 513]\n\u00a0\n patent was in force. The general allegations of the bill were sufficiently comprehensive to meet such a case. But even without that, if the case was one for equitable relief when the suit was instituted, the mere fact that the ground for such relief expired by the expiration of the patent, would not take away the jurisdiction, and preclude the court from proceeding to grant the incidental relief which belongs to cases of that sort. This has often been done in patent causes, and a large number of cases may be cited to that effect; and there is nothing in the decision in Root v. Railway Co., \n105 U.S. 189\n (26 L. Ed. 975), to the contrary. Cotton Tie Co. v. Simmons, \n106 U.S. 89\n (1 S. Ct. 52); Lake Shore, etc., Railway v. Car-Brake Co., \n110 U.S. 229\n (4 S. Ct. 33); Consolidated Valve Co. v. Crosby Valve Co., \n113 U.S. 157\n (5 S. Ct. 513); Thomson v. Wooster, \n114 U.S. 104\n (5 S. Ct. 788).'\n\n And see Beedle v. Bennet, \n122 \nU.S. 71\n, 7 S. Ct. 1090; Busch v. Jones, \n184 \nU.S. 598, 599\n, 600 S., 22 S. Ct. 511.\n The decisions of this court upon the point are entirely harmonious. Root v. Railway Co., referred to in the foregoing quotation, presents no exception. There suit was brought long after the expiration of the patent. No ground for equitable jurisdiction properly could be alleged, for, plainly, none existed, and the bill was merely for an accounting of profits and damages, the remedy at law for which was complete. Accordingly, a decree dismissing the bill was affirmed. We deem it unnecessary to review the decisions in the several circuits thought to be in conflict.\n In Clark v. Wooster, supra, when the bill was filed, the patent had 15 days to run; in the present case, 41 or 42 days remained. The only substantial difference between the two cases is that here an application for an interlocutory injunction was made and denied. But the bill stated a case for equitable relief, and the order denying the interlocutory injunction constituted no bar to a subsequent application upon changed conditions. 2 High on Injunctions (4th Ed.)  1586. While we see nothing to prevent \n\n[278 U.S. 509, 514]\n\u00a0\n a retention of jurisdiction by the chancellor based upon that contingency, we do not rest upon that ground.\n An interlocutory injunction, at least ordinarily, is not a matter of strict right; but the application is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. 1 High on Injunctions (4th Ed.)  11 and 937. And here the trial court denied the application, not because it would have been error to grant it, but in the exercise of its discretion, principally based upon a balancing of the relative conveniences and inconveniences which might result. This is made clear by the trial judge, who, interpreting his own action, expressly held that the relief sought was grantable, but was only denied by the court in the exercise of its discretion. That the case was one for the exercise of discretion is plain. Id.,  937; Southwestern Brush Elec. L. & P. Co. v. Louisiana Elec. L. Co. (C. C.) 45 F. 893, 895, 896; Whitcomb v. Girard Coal Co. (C. C.) 47 F. 315, 317, 318; Rousso v. Barber (C. C. A.) 276 F. 552, 553. The order denying the injunction, therefore, was conclusive in an appellate court; and an order granting it would have been equally so. Buffington v. Harvey, \n95 U.S. 99\n, 100.\n As applied to the question under consideration, there is no sound reason for making a distinction between a failure to obtain an interlocutory injunction, because not asked for, and a like failure, because, though asked for, it was denied only in the exercise of a discretion which might have been rightfully exercised the other way. This was plainly recognized in the Wooster Case, where it was said that if the trial court had deemed it inexpedient to grant an injunction it might have dismissed the bill, 'but that was a matter in its own sound discretion,' which would not be interfered with by this court unless exercised in a manner clearly illegal. (Since the adoption of Equity Rule 22, the question for the court in the case supposed would be not whether to dismiss the bill but whether to transfer the suit to the law side of the court. Twist v. Prairie Oil Co., \n\n[278 U.S. 509, 515]\n\u00a0\n \n274 \nU.S. 684, 689\n, 47 S. Ct. 755.) The action of the trial court here in denying the motion to transfer was within its authority, and does not call for our interference. Jurisdiction of the court sitting in equity, having been rightfully invoked, was not lost either because the interlocutory injunction was denied in the exercise of judicial discretion or by the expiration of the patent pending final decree. This conclusion finds support in the principle that 'a court of equity ought to do justice completely and not by halves,' and to this end, having properly acquired jurisdiction of the cause for any purpose, it will ordinarily retain jurisdiction for all purposes, including the determination of legal rights that otherwise would fall within the exclusive authority of a court of law.

MARGOLIES(1929)\nNo. 347\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 218, 219]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. F. Wright Moxley, of New York City, and Harry F. White, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Sol. A. Rosenblatt, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding, commenced in 1923 in the federal court for southern New York, is what is called a friendly receivership. The federal jurisdiction was invoked solely on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The plaintiff, Hatch, a citizen of New York, is the holder of a dishonored check of the sole defendant, the Morosco Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, apparently with its principal place of business in New York. The bill alleges that the company has a variety of assets, largely intangible, and many liabilities, and that, although financially embarrassed, it is solvent. The prayers are that the court administer its entire property, appoint for this purpose a receiver, and enjoin all persons from interfering with his possession. An answer presented with the bill admitted its allegations and joined in its prayers. Riehle \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 220]\n\u00a0\n was appointed receiver. Thereafter orders were entered restraining the prosecution of suits against the company and directing creditors to file with the receiver their claims against the company. So far as appears, no order of distribution has been made.\n Among the company's creditors, but not mentioned in the bill, was Margolies. Two months before the institution of this suit in the federal court, he had commenced in the Supreme Court of New York an action against the company to recover $124,381 for breach of a contract. That action, in which the company had filed an answer and counterclaim, was pending when the receiver was appointed. It was stayed by the order of the federal court. Margolies did not, so far as appears, challenge the jurisdiction of the federal court. Compare Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 U.S. 36\n, 51-52, 48 S. Ct. 268; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 43 S. Ct. 480; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 500\n, 43 S. Ct. 454. He applied to it for a modification of the order so that he might prosecute his action in the state court, and he sought to have the receiver directed to contest or liquidate the claim there. The denial by the District Court of that motion, and the contention by the receiver that the judgment later recovered in the state court is not to be accepted in the receivership proceedings as conclusive proof of the existence and amount of Margolies' claim, have been the subject of four decisions by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The last of them only is here for review, but what happened earlier must be stated. The record of the proceedings is fragmentary, but supplemented by the opinions of the Circuit Court of Appeals shows the following.\n On the first appeal, Hatch v. Morosco Holding Co. (C. C. A.) 5 F.(2d) 1015, the unanimous court reversed, with costs as 'a plain violation of section 265 of the Judicial Code' (28 USCA  379), the refusal of the District Court to permit Margolies to prosecute his claim in the state court. In doing so, the ap- \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n pellate court said: 'A direction will, however, be included in our mandate, and in the order to be entered thereupon, that should any judgment be entered in said action in the state court, such judgment shall not be taken to be a liquidation of any claim filed or capable of being filed under the judgment (sic) creditors' bill herein, or as in any way affecting the right of the receiver to contest the claim so reduced to judgment de novo. Nothing, however, in our mandate shall be taken to prevent the court below permitting liquidation of Margolies' claim by suit in the state court, should it prefer so to do.'\n Upon the coming down of the mandate, Margolies moved in the District Court that the receiver be directed to liquidate the claim in the action pending in the state court. The motion was denied. Thereupon formal notice of trial of that action was served upon both the receiver and the attorney of record of the company. Neither appeared at the trial. Judgment by default was taken against the company, and, upon an inquest as to the amount of damages, judgment was entered in the sum of $55,283.88, which included interest and costs. Thereupon Margolies moved in the Circuit Court of Appeals that its mandate on the first appeal be recalled and corrected, so that the receiver should not be permitted to try de novo in the District Court the issue on his claim. This motion was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals, apparently without an opinion.\n Margolies then filed in the District Court his verified proof of claim, and at a hearing thereon had before a special master presented an exemplified copy of the judgment in the state court. The receiver thereupon announced his election 'to have the claim tried de novo,' the master recommended that the claim be dismissed 'upon the authority of the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals,' and the District Court ordered that Margolies' claim be dismissed. The order was the subject of another \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 222]\n\u00a0\n appeal by Margolies. Hatch v. Morosco Holding Co., Inc. (Appeal of Margolies) 19 F.(2d) 766 (C. C. A.). There the court held, by a majority decision, that the direction in the mandate to the effect that any judgment recovered in the state court should not affect the right of the receiver to contest the claim de novo in the federal court had been improvidently made. It, therefore, reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.\n At the hearing then had before the special master Margolies put in evidence the judgment and rested. The receiver offered to prove that the claim was less than the amount of the judgment. The master excluded the evidence and recommended that judgment be entered for the full amount save for a small deduction directed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the interest allowed by the state court, which is not challenged here. His report was confirmed by the District Court. The receiver appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. It affirmed the judgment, Hatch v. Morosco Holding Co., Inc. (Ex parte Margolies) 26 F.(2d) 247; but, in doing so, said: 'A majority of the court, as it is now constituted, think that our first decision impairs the jurisdiction of the District Court over assets already in its custody when the judgment of the state court was entered. They believe that the liquidation of claims is a part of the distribution of the estate, since it determines how much each creditor shall get, and that the distribution of the estate is part of what is usually understood as jurisdiction over the res. However, the former decision was reached after unusual deliberation and full presentation of all the questions involved. If it is to be changed, only the Supreme Court may do so; in the same case and on the same claim the first ruling must stand.' This court then granted a writ of certiorari. \n278 \nU.S. 591\n, 46 S. Ct. 29, 73 L. Ed . -. We are of opinion that the \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 223]\n\u00a0\n view there expressed by the majority is erroneous and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The appointment of a receiver of a debtor's property by a federal court confers upon it, regardless of citizenship and of the amount in controversy, federal jurisdiction to decide all questions incident to the preservation, collection, and distribution of the assets. It may do this either in the original suit, Rouse v. Letcher, \n156 \nU.S. 47, 49\n, 50 S., 15 S. Ct. 266; or by ancillary proceedings, White v. Ewing, \n159 \nU.S. 36\n, 15 S. Ct. 1018. Compare Kelley v. Gill, \n245 \nU.S. 116, 119\n, 38 S. Ct. 38. And it may, despite section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  379), issue under section 262 (28 USCA  377), or otherwise, all writs necessary to protect from interference all property in its possession. Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S. Ct. 399. But the appointment of the receiver does not necessarily draw to the federal court the exclusive right to determine all questions or rights of action affecting the debtor's estate. Calhoun v. Lanaux, \n127 U.S. 634\n, 637-639, 8 S. Ct. 1345. This is true, a fortiori, as to the subject-matter of a suit pending in a state court when the receivership suit was begun. Compare Haines v. Carpenter, \n91 U.S. 254\n. The rule that, when the jurisdiction of a court, and the right of a plaintiff to prosecute his suit in it have once attached the right cannot be restrained by proceedings in any other court, applies to protect the jurisdiction of the court unless the case is within some recognized exception to section 265 of the Judicial Code. Compare Hull v. Burr, \n234 \nU.S. 712, 723\n, 34 S. Ct. 892. Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 U.S. 175\n, 182-184, 41 S. Ct. 93; Essanay Film Co. v. Kane, \n258 \nU.S. 358, 361\n, 42 S. Ct. 318; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101, 103\n, 44 S. Ct. 469. Here there is no basis for any such exception.\n The contention that the judgment is not conclusive rests upon the argument that, because the appointment of the receiver draws to the appointing court control of the assets and in the distribution of them among creditors \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 224]\n\u00a0\n there is necessarily involved a determination, both of the existence of the claim and of the amount of the indebtedness, the federal court must have the exclusive power to make that determination. The argument ignores the fact that an order which results in the distribution of assets among creditors has ordinarily a twofold aspect. In so far as it directs distribution, and fixes the time and manner of distribution, it deals directly with the property. In so far as it determines, or recognizes a prior determination of, the existence and amount of the indebtedness of the defendant to the several creditors seeking to participate, it does not deal directly with any of the property. The latter function, which is spoken of as the liquidation of a claim, is strictly a proceeding in personam. Of course, no one can obtain any part of the assets, or enforce a right to specific property in the possession of a receiver, except upon application to the court which appointed him. Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 89 S., 43 S. Ct. 480. But the judgment of the state court does not purport to deal with the property. The sole question involved there was the existence and amount of Margolies' claim against the corporation, and the sole question involved here is the proof of that claim. There is no inherent reason why the adjudication of the liability of the debtor in personam may not be had in some court other than that which has control of the res. It is only necessary that in the receivership proof of the claim be made in an orderly way, so that it may be established who the creditors are and the amounts due them.\n The power to fix the time for distribution may include the power, in the exercise of judicial discretion, to decline to postpone distribution awaiting disposition of litigation in another court over a contested claim. Compare Wm. Filine's Sons Co. v. Weed, \n245 \nU.S. 597, 602\n, 38 S. Ct. 211; Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City Ry. (C. C. A.) 229 F. 120. But there is no reason why the character of the proof \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 225]\n\u00a0\n required in the receivership suit for any purpose should be different from that which would have been required had the judgment in the state court been rendered prior to the appointment of the receiver; or from that which would be required if an independent suit on the judgment were brought in the federal court. It would hardly be doubted that a final judgment, recovered in a state court prior to the commencement of the receivership suit, would establish conclusively the existence and amount of the claim against the debtor, if later a decree were entered in the federal court distributing the funds in the receiver's hands among its creditors. Whether such a judgment recovered in a suit commenced after the appointment of the receiver would operate as res judicata we need not consider. For Margolies' suit was begun before. He had, under section 265 of the Judicial Code, the right to prosecute that suit to judgment despite the institution later of the receivership proceedings. He must have, as an incident thereof, the further right to have it accepted therein as an adjudication of the existence of the indebtedness. The fact that neither the company nor the receiver undertook to defend in the state court is, in this connection, immaterial. A judgment of a court having jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter operates as res judicata, in the absence of fraud or collusion, even if obtained upon a default. Last Chance Mining Co. v. Tyler Mining Co., \n157 \nU.S. 683, 691\n, 15 S. Ct. 733. Compare Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Slaght, \n205 \nU.S. 122\n, 27 S. Ct. 442.\n The establishment of a claim constituting the basis of the right to participate in the distribution of property in the possession of one court is often conclusively determined by a judgment obtained in another court. Thus, a judgment of a federal court may establish conclusively the fact which entitles one to share in a decedent's estate in course of administration in a state court. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Hess v. Reynolds, \n113 \nU.S. 73\n, 5 S. Ct. 377; \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 226]\n\u00a0\n Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608, 620\n, 13 S. Ct. 906; Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank, \n215 \nU.S. 33\n, 30 S. Ct. 10. Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (14 Stat. 517), a judgment against the debtor rendered in a suit in a state court pending at the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings established conclusively in bankruptcy the existence and amount of the debt provable against the estate. Norton v. Switzer, \n93 \nU.S. 355, 363\n, 364 S.. Compare Hill v. Harding, \n107 \nU.S. 631\n, 2 S. Ct. 404. A judgment in a state court against a receiver, pursuant to section 66 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  125), establishes conclusively the right to payment from the funds of the receivership, although the act makes the suit in the state court 'subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such manager or receiver was appointed so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice.' \n1\n Where a receivership of a national bank is appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency, a judgment entered after the appointment in an action commenced in a state court before the appointment is binding upon the receivers as well as upon the bank. Speckert v. German National Bank (C. C. A.) 98 F. 151, 154.\n The rule that the appointment by a federal court of a receiver on a creditor's bill gives it no right to stay a suit then pending in a state court and that the judgment in personam thereafter recovered therein in the state court against the debtor must be held to have established conclusively the existence and amount of the claim for the purpose of proof in the federal court, and will enable the claimant to participate in a distribution among creditors \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 227]\n\u00a0\n of the debtor's property ordered therein, has long been applied in some of the lower federal courts. \n2\n No case has been found in which the right has been denied. A like rule has been applied in state courts. \n3\n In Pendleton v. Russell, \n144 \nU.S. 640, 644\n, 12 S. Ct. 743, it was sought to prove against funds of a dissolved corporation in the hands of a receiver appointed by a court of New York a judgment recovered in Tennessee after the dissolution. The proof was disallowed because the dissolution had operated, like death, as an abatement of the suit. But the court said: 'Had the original judgment of the Circuit Court of the United States been affirmed, instead of being reversed, it having been rendered when the insurance company was in existence, it would have stood as a valid claim against the assets of that company after its dissolution.'\n There are some cases arising under the Bankruptcy Act and some under state insolvency laws in which a judgment recovered in the state court was held not to \n\n[279 U.S. 218, 228]\n\u00a0\n be conclusive in the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Thus, it has been held by some lower federal courts that a judgment recovered after institution of bankruptcy proceedings in an action commenced in a state court prior thereto, on a claim to which the limited power to stay action in a state court conferred by section 11 of the Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 549 (11 USCA  29), applies, is not to be accepted in bankruptcy as conclusive proof of the claim. \n4\n Similarly it has been held, where a statutory proceeding for the winding up an insolvent corporation is brought in the state of the incorporation, that the assets will be distributed only among those persons who have been found to be creditors either by that court or elsewhere with its leave, and that a judgment recovered in another state without leave from it will not entitle the plaintiff to share in the assets. \n5\n These decisions are not inconsistent with the conclusion stated above. They have no application to receiverships in a federal court sitting in equity, which lacks the power to stay an action in the state court. Margolies had the absolute right to prosecute his claim to judgment in the state court, the order of the District Court staying its prosecution was properly dissolved, and the judgment entered there is conclusive as between the parties and their privies in the federal court.

SMITH(1929)\nNo. 63\nArgued: November 23, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. T. F. Railsback and J. H. Brady, both of Kansas City, Kan., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[278 U.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of error to the Supreme Court of Kansas must be dismissed. The alleged grounds therefor are so lacking in substance that they may be properly designated as frivolous.\n Plaintiff in error unsuccessfully resisted condemnation by the state of Kansas of the Shawnee Mission, a place held by the court below to possess unusual historical interest. She claims that the legislation under which the proceedings were conducted conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment, and to permit its enforcement will deprive her of property without due process of law. Her theory is that the assailed statutes do not adequately specify the reason for the condemnation, and fail to reveal the use to which the property is to be put; that it 'was not taken for any specified or particular use, and therefore for no public use.'\n Chapter 26, art. 3(26-301) Kansas Rev. Stats. 1923, provides:\n'That the power of eminent domain shall extend to any tract or parcel of land in the State of Kansas, which possesses unusual historical interest. Such land may be taken for the use and benefit of the State by condemnation as herein provided.'\n\n And chapter 205, Laws of 1927, declare that the land in question possesses unusual historical interest, and directs its taking for the use of the state by condemnation, as provided by law.\n The Supreme Court of the State held that-\n'The meaning of the statute is clear enough, that places invested with unusual historical interest may be acquired by the state by gift, devise, or condemnation, for the use and benefit of the state, as places of that character. If \n\n[278 U.S. 191, 193]\n\u00a0\n there were any doubt about this, the joint resolution and appropriation act relating to acquisition of the Shawnee Mission interpret the eminent domain statute, and show what the legislative intention was. The state historical society is to be custodian of the place. On taking it over, a qualified person is to make a survey and recommend measures for proper preservation and restoration of the Mission, and all things are to be done necessary to and consistent with use of the place by the state as a place of unusual historical interest.'\n\n And further that the Shawnee Mission is a place invested with unusual historical interest, the use of which by the state is a public one.\n Under the circumstances here revealed, the construction placed upon her statutes by the Supreme Court of Kansas is binding upon us.

WARD(1929)\nNo. 667\nArgued: April 10, 1929Decided: April 22, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 337, 338]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter N. Seligsberg, of New York City, for appellants.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits brought by dealers in eyeglasses for an injunction prohibiting the enforcement of chapter 379 of the New York Laws of 1928, which amends the Education Law (Consol. Laws, c. 16) by inserting two sections, of which the material portion makes it unlawful to sell at retail in any store or established place of business 'any spectacles, eyeglasses, or lenses for the correction of vision, unless a duly licensed physician or duly qualified optometrist, certified under this article, be in charge of and personal attendance at the booth, counter or place, where such articles are sold in such store or established place of business.' The complainants moved for a preliminary injunction, a statutory court of three judges was convened and after a hearing the injunction was refused and the bills were dismissed on \n\n[279 U.S. 337, 339]\n\u00a0\n the ground that no cause of action was shown. 29 F.(2d) 762.\n The complainants sell only ordinary spectacles with convex spherical lens, which merely magnify and which it is said can do no harm. The customers select for themselves without being examined and buy glasses for a relatively small sum. It is said that the cost of employing an optometrist would make the complainants' business impossible, and that in the common case of eyes only grown weaker by age the requirement is unreasonable. But the argument most pressed is that the statute does not provide for an examination by the optometrist in charge of the counter. This as it is presented seems to us a perversion of the act. When the statute requires a physician or optometrist to be in charge of the place of sale in personal attendance at it, obviously it means in charge of it by reason of and in the exercise of his professional capacity. If we assume that an examination of the eye is not required in every case it plainly is the duty of the specialist to make up his mind whether one is necessary and, if he thinks it necessary, to make it. We agree to all the generalities about not supplying criminal laws with what they omit, but there is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean. Moreover, as pointed out below, wherever the requirements of the act stop, there can be no doubt that the presence and superintendence of the specialist tend to diminish an evil. A statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did, or because it may not succeed in bringing about the result that it tends to produce.\n Of course we cannot suppose the act to have been passed for sinister motives. We will assume that there are strong reasons against interference with the business as now done-but it is obvious that much good would be ac- \n\n[279 U.S. 337, 340]\n\u00a0\n complished if eyes were examined in a great many cases where hitherto they have not been, and the balancing of the considerations of advantage and disadvantage is for the Legislature, not for the courts. We cannot say, as the complainants would have us say, that the supposed benefits are a cloak for establishing a monopoly and a pretense.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUSSELL v.

Pritchard, both of Birmingham, Ala., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. E. G. Davis, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States, by bill filed January 23, 1925, sought to recover from petitioners, stockholders of the Pine Lumber Company, additional income and profit taxes for the year 1918 assessed against that corporation in March, 1924. The company made a return to the collector for 1918 on June 12, 1919, and afterwards paid the amount indicated thereby.\n Petitioners claimed the suit was barred under the limitation specified by the applicable statute. They succeeded in the District Court; but the Circuit Court of Appeals held another view, and reversed the decree dismissing the bill.\n The statutory provisions which require special consideration are printed below:\n Revenue Act 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1083:\n'Sec. 250(d).

(a) The following parts of the Revenue Act of 1921 are repealed, to take effect (except as otherwise provided in this Act) upon the enactment of this Act, subject to the limitations provided in subdivisions (b) and (c):\n\n'Title II (called 'Income Tax') as of January 1, 1924; ...\n\n'(b) The parts of the Revenue Act of 1921 which are repealed by this Act shall (except as provided in sections 280 and 316 (316 is not important here) and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act) remain in force for the assessment and collection of all taxes imposed by such Act, and for the assessment, imposition, and collection of all interest, penalties, or forfeitures which have accrued or may accrue in relation to any such taxes, and for the assessment and collection, to the extent provided in the Revenue Act of 1921, of all taxes imposed by prior income, war-profits, or excess- profits tax acts, and for the assessment, imposition, and collection of all interest, penalties, or forfeitures which have accrued or may accrue in relation to any such taxes. ...' 26 USCA  1260\n\n\n\n From the foregoing it appears: Under the act of 1918, both assessment and suit within five years were necessary. The act of 1921 required that taxes imposed thereby should be assessed within four years; that taxes payable under the act of 1918, and earlier ones, should be assessed within five years; and it limited the period within which any suit might be brought to five years after the return. With the exceptions specified by section 278, the act of 1924 requires that assessment of taxes laid by it or the act of 1921 and any suit to collect the same shall come within four years after the return; also, in respect of taxes due \n\n[278 U.S. 181, 186]\n\u00a0\n under the acts of 1918, etc., that no assessment or suit shall be permitted later than five years after the return.\n The exceptions to the general rule of section 277, which are specified by section 278, and here important, relate to those cases only where there has been assessment but no suit; and petitioners aver that these exceptions do not apply where the assessment was made prior to June 2, 1924.\n According to the general limitations contained in the acts of 1918, 1921, and 1924, the time within which suit might have been brought upon the assessment of March, 1924, against the Pine Lumber Company expired June 12, 1924-five years after the return date. And, unless the act of 1924 repealed the old limitation and established another, petitioners must prevail. The United States claim that section 278, Act of 1924, extended the limitation to March, 1930-six years after the assessment. Petitioners deny that the act of June 2, 1924, should be so construed. They maintain that it did not extend the period for suit where an assessment had been made prior to its passage, and say that section 278(e) (2), expressly negatives the contrary theory.\n When the Revenue Act of 1924 passed, many parties were liable for taxes imposed by former acts-1921, 1918, etc. Against some there were assessments; others had not been assessed. It made provision concerning taxes thereafter to accrue; also for those already due. It distinguished between existing assessments and those which were to follow. It established a Board of Tax Appeals and gave the right of appeal thereto whenever thereafter the Commissioner should propose to assess for deficiency. It thus created a radical distinction between assessments prior to June 2, 1924, and later ones which, generally at least, if objected to, could not be made without assent of the Board. To secure proper action by the Board might require considerable time, and this was provided for by extending the limitation to six years after assessment. \n\n[278 U.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n But the taxpayer was afforded protection against any improper action by the Commissioner through an appeal before any assessment could be actually imposed-a new and valuable right.\n Section 1100, Act of 1924, kept in force 'except as provided in sections 280 and 316 (316 is unimportant here) and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act' those parts of the act of 1921 which provided for assessment and collection of taxes imposed by that act or earlier ones. Section 280 plainly relates only to assessments made subsequent to June 2, 1924; but counsel for the United States maintain that, within the meaning of section 1100, modification of the act of 1921 was specifically provided by sections 277 and 278 when read in conjunction.\n Section 277, as above shown, limits suits for taxes imposed by the act of 1918 to five years after the return, except (section 278) in certain cases where an assessment has been made. In the excepted cases the period for suit is extended to six years after the assessment. But section 278 further provides that it shall not authorize the collection of a tax after the same has been actually barred by the applicable statute, and further that it shall not affect any assessment made prior to June 2, 1924.\n Manifestly, but for section 278, petitioners would be free from liability under the five-year limitation in the act of 1918, continued by the act of 1921. If section 278 refers only to assessments made after June 2, 1924, petitioners are not liable.\n If an assessment made before that date comes within the ambit of section 278, its effect would be retroactive; and certainly it would produce radical change in the existing status of the claim against the petitioners-would extend for some five years a liability which had almost expired. United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n276 \nU.S. 160\n, 48 S. Ct. 236, declares, 'Statutes are not to be given retroactive effect or construed to change the status of claims fixed in \n\n[278 U.S. 181, 188]\n\u00a0\n accordance with earlier provisions unless the legislative purpose so to do plainly appears.' No plain purpose to change the status of the claim against petitioners as it existed just before June 2, 1924, can be spelled out of the words in section 278 or otherwhere.\n Paragraph (e)(2) of section 278 expressly directs that that section shall not affect any assessment made before June 2, 1924. Counsel for the United States maintain that to extend the time for bringing suit thereon does not 'affect' an assessment within the meaning of the paragraph. We cannot agree. Some real force must be given to the words used-they were not employed without definite purpose. The rather obvious design, we think, was to deprive section 278 of any possible application to cases where assessment had been made prior to June 2, 1924.\n The legislative history of the act of 1924 lends support to the conclusion which we have reached. The changes introduced into the act of 1926 cannot authorize construction of the earlier one not consonant with the language there employed.\n The judgment is reversed. The cause will be remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAFE DEPOSIT & TRUST CO.

Miller, Jr., of Richmond, Va., for Commonwealth of virginia.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause is properly here upon appeal. The petition for certiorari is therefore denied. May 4, 1920, Lucius J. Kellam, then domiciled and residing in Accomac county, Va., transferred and delivered to the Safe Deposit & Trust Company of Baltimore, Md., stocks and bonds of sundry corporations valued at $50,000, with power to change the investments, upon the following terms:\n'... To collect the income arising therefrom and after paying such taxes as may be chargeable thereon and its 5% commissions on the gross income, to accumulate the net income for the benefit of the two sons of myself, that is to say, Lucius J. Kellam, Jr., who attained the age of eight years on September 25, 1919, and Emerson Polk Kellam, who attained the age of five years on February 5, 1920, and when the said Lucius J. Kellam, Jr., arrives at twenty-five years of age, to deliver to him one-half of the principal of the estate hereby conveyed and one-half of the said accumulations of income-the other half of the \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n said principal and accumulations of income shall be retained by said Trustee and all income therefrom shall continue to be accumulated until the said Emerson Polk Kellam arrives at twenty-five years of age when he shall become entitled to the said one-half of the principal and accumulations so retained together with all further accumulations thereon. If either of said two sons shall die before receiving his share of said principal and accumulations, then the same shall be paid over and delivered to his children living at his death; and if either shall die before receiving his share without issue, then such share shall be added to the share of the survivor and be held for his use and benefit in the same manner precisely as his original share is held.'\n\n The deed made no provision for the event of death of both sons under 25 without issue. The donor reserved to himself power of revocation, but without exercising it, died in 1920. Administration on his estate was had in Accomac county, Va., and his two sons are domiciled there.\n Except as changed by reinvestment, the trust company has continued to hold the original securities in Baltimore, Md., and has paid the taxes regularly demanded by that city and state on account of them.\n An assessment for taxation in Accomac county, Va., for the years 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1925 upon the whole corpus of the trust estate was sustained by the court below-the highest state tribunal to which the matter could be submitted. It declared section 2307, Virginia Code (1919), as amended in 1920 (Laws 1920, c. 376) 1922 (Laws 1922, c. 520), and 1923 ( Laws Ex. Sess. 1923, c. 104),1 \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 91]\n\u00a0\n applicable, adequate to support the demand, and not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Appellant maintains that so interpreted and applied the statute lays a tax upon property wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the state and consequently offends the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Manifestly, the securities are subject to taxation in Maryland where they are in the actual possession of the trust company-holder of the legal title. That they are property within Maryland is not questioned. De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 382\n, 39 S. Ct. 524. Also, nobody within Virginia has present right to their control or possession, or to receive income therefrom, or to cause them to be brought physically within her borders. They have no legal situs for taxation in Virginia unless the legal fiction mobilia sequuntur personam is applicable and controlling. The court below, recognizing this, held the two sons, in conjunction with the administrator of the father's estate-all domiciled in Virginia-really owned the fund \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 92]\n\u00a0\n and that by reason of the fiction its taxable situs followed them.\n We need not make any nice inquiry concerning the ultimate or equitable ownership of the securities or the exact nature of the interest held by the sons. In the disclosed circumstances, we think that is not a matter of controlling importance.\n Ordinarily this court recognizes that the fiction of mobilia sequuntur personam may be applied in order to determine the situs of intangible personal property for taxation. Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. But the general rule must yield to established fact of legal ownership, actual presence and control elsewhere, and ought not to be applied if so to do would result in inescapable and patent injustice whether through double taxation, or otherwise.

Here, where the possessor of the legal title holds the securities in Maryland, thus giving them a permanent situs for lawful taxation there, and no person in Virginia has present right to their enjoyment or power to remove them, the fiction must be disregarded. It plainly conflicts with fact; the securities did not and could not follow any person domiciled in Virginia. Their actual situs is in Maryland and cannot be changed by the cestuis que trust.\n The power of Virginia to lay a tax upon the fair value of any interest in the securities actually owned by one of her resident citizens is not now presented for consideration. See Maguire v. Trefry, supra.\n A statute of a state which undertakes to tax things wholly beyond her jurisdiction or control conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.

A. 1915C, 903.\n Here we must decide whether intangibles-stocks, bonds-in the hands of the holder of the legal title with definite taxable situs at its residence, not subject to change by the equitable owner, may be taxed at the latter's domicile in another state. We think not. The reasons which led this court in Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493, and Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316, to deny application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam to tangibles apply to the intangibles in appellant's possession. They have acquired a situs separate from that of the beneficial owners. The adoption of a contrary rule would 'involve possibilities of an extremely serious character' by permitting double taxation, both unjust and oppressive. And the fiction of mobilia sequuntur personam 'was intended for convenience, and not to be controlling where justice does not demand it.'\n No opinion of this court seems definitely to rule the exact point now presented. Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, sustained an assessment of tax by New York upon the transfer of credits, declared to have taxable situs within her borders, under the will of a citizen of Illinois. \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 94]\n\u00a0\n In Wheeler v. Sohmer, \n233 \nU.S. 434\n, 34 S. Ct. 607, the tax was not laid at the owner's domicile, but by the state wherein the securities were deposited. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S. Ct. 473, involved an inheritance tax; the creator of the trust resided in Wisconsin at his death and an Illinois company with legal title then held possession of the property in Chicago; but the creator had retained full power to revoke the trust and regain control. Fidelity, etc., Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54\n, 38 S. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124, sustained a tax laid at the domicile of the legal owner. He had full power to control the deposits in St. Louis banks and might have brought the entire fund within Kentucky's jurisdiction. In Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410, the decedent-a resident of Connecticut-had control and present right to all benefits arising from the property. The legal title was not held by another with the duty to retain possession, as in the present cause. Moreover, this court did not there determine that the property had a taxable situs in New York.\n Any general statement in the above opinions which may seem to interfere with the conclusion here announced must be limited and confined to the precise situation then under consideration.\n It would be unfortunate, perhaps amazing, if a legal fiction originally invented to prevent personalty from escaping just taxation should compel us to accept the irrational view that the same securities were within two states at the same instant and because of this to uphold a double and oppressive assessment.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 95]\n\u00a0\n\n Concurring opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I concur in the result. It is enough to support it that, as stipulated in the record, the Virginia assessment was levied against a trustee domiciled in Maryland upon securities held by it in trust in its exclusive possession and control there, and so is forbidden as an attempt to tax property without the jurisdiction. Brooke v. Norfolk, \n277 \nU.S. 27\n, 48 S. Ct. 422. But the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a tax on the beneficiaries, in Virginia, where they are domiciled, measured by their equitable interests, seems to me not to be presented by the record, and so, under the settled rule of decision of this court ought not now to be decided. Burton v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 283, 296\n, 25 S. Ct. 243; Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 39 S. Ct. 468; Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Light v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 523, 538\n, 31 S. Ct. 485.\n No attempt was made by Virginia to tax the equitable interests of thebeneficiaries of the trust. That the thing taxed or the measure of the tax is different from the equitable interests of the beneficiaries, as affected by the specified contingencies, sufficiently appears from the fact that the one may well have been of different value than the other. In fact, the securities seem to have been assessed at their full value, although the equitable interests of the beneficiaries are less than the whole.\n It may be that Virginia, following its own view of the nature of vested and contingent interests, might tax the interests of these beneficiaries as though they were the whole, but it is sufficient for present purposes that it has not assumed to do so. In the face of the present record we are not required to speculate how far a tax, forbidden because assessed upon property beyond the jurisdiction, may be upheld because it may be passed on to the bene- \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 96]\n\u00a0\n ficiaries in Virginia and the equitable interests thus reached by indirection.\n If the question were here I would not be prepared to go so far as to say that the equitable rights in personam of the beneficiaries of the trust might not have been taxed at the place of their domicile quite as much as a debt secured by a mortgage on land in another jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact that the land is also taxed at its situs. In neither case, if the threat of double taxation were controlling, which under the decisions it is not, Fidelity & Columbia Tr. Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks County, \n253 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 40 S. Ct. 558; Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 109\n, 42 S. Ct. 15; cf. Swiss Oil Corporation v. Shanks, \n273 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 47 S. Ct. 393, would it seem that in any real sense is there double taxation, since the legal interests protected and taxed by the two taxing jurisdictions are different.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The Special Court of Appeals was plainly right in holding that the deed of trust conferred an absolute gift upon the two beneficiaries, perhaps, though I doubt it, subject to be divested upon a condition subsequent. Gray, Perpetuities (1st Ed.)  108. If the beneficiaries could be taxed at all they could be taxed for the whole value of the property, because the whole title was in them, even if liable to be divested at some future time in a not very probable event.\n I am of opinion that on principle they can be taxed. In the first place I do not think that it matters that the owners, residing in Virginia, have only an equitable title. To be sure the trustee having the legal title and posses- \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 97]\n\u00a0\n sion of the bonds in Maryland may be taxed there. But that does not affect the right of Virginia by reason of anything that I know of in the Constitution of the United States. Bonaparte v. Appeal Tax Court, \n104 U.S. 592\n; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 733 S., 23 S. Ct. 401; Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 34 S. Ct. 201, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 40 S.

Sohmer, \n233 \nU.S. 434\n, 34 S. Ct. 607.\n I see no other fact to cut down Virginia's power. It is true that the conception of domicil has been applied to tangible personal property and it now is established that a State cannot tax the owner of a such property if it is permanently situated in another State. But hitherto the decisions have been confined to tangibles that in a plain and obvious way owed their protection to another power. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 206\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493. It seemed to me going pretty far to discover even that limitation in the Fourteenth Amendment. It opens vistas to extend the restriction to stocks and bonds in a way that I cannot reconcile with Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. Taxes generally are imposed upon persons, for the general advantages of living within the jurisdiction, not upon property, although generally measured more or less by reference to the riches of the person taxed, on grounds not of fiction but of fact. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124; Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n. The notion that the property must be within the jurisdiction puts the emphasis on the wrong thing. The owner may be taxed for it although it never has been within the State. Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63\n, 32 S. Ct. 13. It seems to me going still further astray to rely upon the situs of the debt. A debt is a legal relation between two parties and, if we think of facts, is situated at least as much with the debtor against whom the obligation must be enforced as it is with the creditor. To say that a debt \n\n[280 U.S. 83, 98]\n\u00a0\n has a situs with the creditor is merely to clothe a foregone conclusion with a fiction. The place of the property is not material except where inability to protect carries with it inability to tax. But that is an exceptional consequence. One State may tax the owner of bonds of another State, although it certainly contributes nothing to their validity. Bonaparte v. Appeal Tax Court, \n104 U.S. 592\n. It is admitted that Maryland could tax the trustee in this case although most at least of the securities handed over were beyond the power of Maryland to affect in any substantial way. The equitable owners of the fund were in Virginia and I think they could be taxed for it there. I do not understand that any merely technical question is raised on the naming of the trustee instead of the cestui que trust as the party taxed. Nor is there any question of the amount. Throughout the record, by the Court and by the trustee, the single issue is stated to be whether the fund can be reached. In the words of the trustee it is: 'Has such corpus, so created and held, a taxable situs in Virginia within the saction of section one of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States?' I think the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 2307, Va. Code 1919 (as amended).

STATE TAX COM'N OF NEW YORK(1929)\nNo. 79\nArgued: November 28, 1928Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Angulo and Edward H. Blanc, both of New York City, for plaintiffs in error Salomon's executors.\n Mr. Abraham L. Gutman, of New York City, for plaintiff in error Simonson's executors.\n Messrs. Seth T. Cole, of Albany, N. Y., and A. Welles Stump, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which were argued together, present the question whether the provision in the New York Transfer Law for taxing the transfer of contingent remainders violates the due process clause or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That statute imposes a graduated succession tax. On the transfer of life estates and vested remainders the tax is measured by their respective values as of the testator's death and are payable then. The tax on the transfer of contingent remainders is not payable until the death of the life tenant; and it is measured by the value at the testator's death of the estate transferred, undiminished by the value of the intervening life estate. For the due payment of the deferred tax the \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n executor must furnish adequate security. The amount of the security is fixed by a temporary taxing order. Laws of 1925, c. 144,  1, 2, amending sections 230 and 241 of Tax Law (Consol. Laws, c. 60).\n It will be sufficient to state the facts and proceedings in the Salomon Case. Meyer Hecht died in 1925 a resident of New York. He bequeathed his residuary estate in trust to his widow for life; and upon her death one equal share thereof to each child then living and to the then living issue per stirpes of each deceased child. The value of the residue as of the testator's death was appraised at $322,094.37. The then value of the widow's life estate therein, computed according to the standard mortality tables using 5 per cent. interest, was appraised at $ 124,957; the tax then payable was assessed thereon, and no objection is made thereto. If the future interests had been vested remainders, the tax thereon would have been payable then on an appraisal of $197,137.37; that is, on the difference between the then value of the residue and the then value of the life estate. The future interests were all contingent. The tax was not payable until the death of the life tenant. The temporary taxing order appraised their aggregate value at the widow's death as $322, 094.37; that is, at the value of the residue undiminished by the value of the life estate. Security for the future payment of the tax was required to be given as the statute requires. An appeal from the appraisal was denied by the surrogate of New York county. Matter of Hecht's Estate, 127 Misc. Rep. 211, 216 N. Y. S. 321. His judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, 219 App. Div. 656, 220 N. Y. S. 325. Its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, without opinion, 246 N. Y. 602, 159 N. E. 668; and by the remittitur it became the judgment of the Surrogate's Court. That judgment is final within the meaning of section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 937, 28 USCA  344(a). Compare Wheeler v. Sohmer, \n233 \nU.S. 434\n, 34 S. Ct. 607; Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122\n, 41 S. Ct. 43. \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n The constitutional claims were duly made below, and the case is properly here.\n The need of a peculiar provision for taxing the transfer of contingent remainders arises from the fact that the New York law imposes a graduated tax. The rates differ according to the amount or value of the gift to the particular beneficiary and also according to his relationship to the decedent. The lowest rate payable by a lineal descendant is 1 per cent.; the highest, 4 per cent. The lowest rate payable by a stranger is 5 per cent.; the highest, 8 per cent. As the remainders are contingent, it is impossible to know, before the contingency happens, in whom the remainders will vest; and it may be impossible to determine until then the relationship of the beneficiaries to the testator and the portions of the estate which they will respectively receive. Thus the rate of taxation will remain uncertain. For this reason, the statute postpones until the contingency happens both the definitive assessment of the tax on the transfer of the contingent remainders and the payment thereof. In respect to vested remainders, there is no obstacle to requiring both assessment and payment of this graduated tax as of the testator's death. The amount of the tax can be determined then, because it is known who the vested remaindermen are, what the share of each is and what his relationship to the testator was. And the value of the remainders as of the testator's death is likewise known, being the difference between the then value of the property transferred and the computed value of the life estate.\n The need of a special provision for the taxation in respect to contingent remainders and the reasonableness of the particular measure adopted in 1925 appear from the history of the legislation. Since the enactment of the Transfer Tax Law in 1885 (chapter 483), the aim of the Legislature has been at all times to adopt a method of laying the tax which would be fair to both the life tenant \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n and the future interest and would protect the revenues of the state. From time to time, various methods for doing this were tried. Experience revealed their defects. Under the original law and the early amendments, the transfers to contingent remaindermen were not taxable upon the testator's death. Matter of Cager, 111 N. Y. 343, 18 N. E. 866. They were taxable at the time when they vested in possession. Matter of Stewart, 131 N. Y. 274, 30 N. E. 184, 14 L. R. A. 836. And the tax then payable was computed upon the value, as of the testator's death, of the property transferred, less the value of the intervening life estate. Matter of Sloane's Estate, 154 N. Y. 109, 47 N. E. 978. Under this method the revenue derived from the tax on the contingent remainder was less than it would have been had the remainder been a vested one. For the state lost the benefit of the money during the period intervening between the death of the testator and that of the life tenant. To overcome this loss to the state and the discrimination thereby in favor of the contingent remaindermen, the Legislature provided by chapter 284 of the Laws of 1897 that the tax payable on the vesting of the contingent remainder should be measured by the full value of the property as of the testator's death, without deducting the value of the intervening life estate. Matter of Seligmann's Estate, 219 N. Y. 656, 114 N. E. 853. This statute, while on its face eliminating the discrimination in favor of contingent remaindermen, was found to result in serious loss of revenue to the state. Taxes escaped collection when they became due, because it proved to be impossible to ascertain currently when the contingencies happened and hence when a tax became payable. To remedy this defect, it was provided by chapter 76 of the Laws of 1899 that the tax must be paid upon the testator's death, and that it should then be paid out of the corpus of the estate at the highest applicable rate, with a provision for paying to the remainderman the surplus with interest if it should prove that a lower rate was applicable. Matter of Vander- \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n bilt's Estate, 172 N. Y. 69, 64 N. E. 782. This provision, while fully safeguarding the state's revenues, favored the remainderman at the expense of the life tenant. Matter of Brez's Estate, 172 N. Y. 609, 64 N. E. 958. For under this provision the life tenant lost the income on the full amount deducted to ensure payment of the tax on the contingent remainder; and the remainderman received from the state, with interest, such part thereof as proved not to be required for the ultimate payment of the tax. Thereupon some relief to the life tenant was afforded by chapter 800 of the Laws of 1911. But it was not until the act of 1925 here challenged provided for appraisal of the remainder as stated, that the Legislature succeeded in devising a means of laying the tax which operated justly as between life tenant and remaindermen and safeguarded the state's revenues.\n First. The contention that the method of taxation prescribed violates the due process clause rests upon the assertion that in measuring the transfer tax in respect to a contingent remainder by the corpus of the trust fund undiminished by the value of the intervening life estate, something is taxed which does not exist. The argument is that taxation even of an inheritance must be measured by property taxable within the jurisdiction, Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; that New York levies the tax on the transfer of title from the testator, not on its value at the time of the transfer of possession, Matter of Davis' Estate, 149 N. Y. 539, 44 N. E. 185; that the tax must, therefore, be measured by what he transferred when he transferred it; that the aggregate value of the parts transferred by the testator cannot be greater than the value of the whole; but that here the state lays a tax upon both the value of the life interest and the undiminished value of the corpus.\n The argument presented is unsound, because it ignores the fact that the tax in respect to the contingent remainders is not payable until after the death of the life tenant. The temporary taxing order, entered upon the \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 490]\n\u00a0\n testator's death, is made solely to ensure that the tax so deferred will be paid when ultimately assessed. The requirement may be satisfied by depositing with the state either approved securities or cash. In either event the income collected from the security prior to the time when the tax becomes payable is accounted for to the executor, and, after the tax has been paid, the securities or cash remaining on deposit will be accounted for to him. By applying the applicable rate to the full value of that which comes into enjoyment, and not exacting payment of the tax until then, a just result is sought. For the definitive assessment of the contingent remainder and the payment of the tax thereon are postponed to the same date. The due process clause places no restriction on a state as to the time at which an inheritance tax shall be levied or the property valued for purposes of such tax. Compare Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 543\n, 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215.\n Second. It is claimed that the tax violates the equal protection clause. One contention is that it unjustifiably discriminates between contingent and vested remainders in that the value of the life estate is first deducted in assessing the latter. It is true that an exact equivalency is not always achieved, because the tax is graduated according to the value of the remainder. But since the payment of the tax is postponed until the termination of the life estate the present value of the tax will tend to approximate what it would have been, if vested remainders had been given to the same persons and in the same shares that eventually go to the contingent remaindermen-assuming, of course, that the same rate of interest is used in making the calculation of both the present value of the tax and the present value of the future estate. It is true, also, that there is not an exact equivalency, since life tenants do not die at the precise termination of their expectancies. But this uncertainty underlies the taxation of all future interests, vested \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 491]\n\u00a0\n or contingent, wherever the tax is laid separately in respect to life estates and remainders. The uncertainty is unavoidable unless the state concludes to postpone laying the tax upon the remainders until they come into enjoyment, a course which it is not obliged to pursue. Moreover, there are differences between vested and contingent remainders which justify classification in imposing inheritance taxes. Compare Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 141\n, 143 S., 45 S. Ct. 424 (69 L. Ed. 884, 44 A. L. R. 1454); Billings v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 97\n, 23 S. Ct. 272; Board of Education v. Illinois, \n203 \nU.S. 553\n, 27 S. Ct. 171, 8 Ann. Cas. 157; Beers v. Glynn, \n211 \nU.S. 477\n, 29 S. Ct. 186; Keeney v. Comptroller of State of New York \n222 \nU.S. 525\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139\n\n\n Third. Several other reasons are urged why the statute should be held obnoxious to the equality clause. It is said that, the tax being graduated according to amounts, there will result from the use of mortality tables discrimination between members of the same class. It is urged that, since the tax is not collected until the termination of the life estate, a more perfect equality would be achieved by assessing the tax on the value of the remainder, after deducting the value of the life estate, and allowing interest to the state for the actual known period during which the tax was withheld. The fact that a better taxing system might be conceived does not render the law invalid. As was said in Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, \n228 \nU.S. 61, 69\n, 70 S., 33 S. Ct. 441, 443 (57 L. Ed. 730): 'To be able to find fault with a law is not to demonstrate its invalidity. ... The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations-illogical, it may be, and unscientific.' Further, it is said that postponing payment of the tax will prove burdensome, because it involves giving security to ensure the deferred payment, and that where the security is given by the deposit of cash, the income earned thereon will probably be less than would have been earned if the money had been otherwise employed. To all such objections it may be answered that minor inequalities and \n\n[278 U.S. 484, 492]\n\u00a0\n hardships are incidents of every system of taxation and do not render the legislation obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. \n1\n General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367\n, 46 S. Ct. 234.\n Whether the state's power to tax the privilege of taking by will or descent property within its jurisdiction is in any way limited by the Fourteenth Amendment has not been argued. As we are of opinion that none of the objections urged can be sustained, we have no occasion to consider that question. Compare Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 140\n, 45 S. Ct. 424 (69 L.

They were heard together here. The invalidity of the two general claims of the patent, 5 and 6, has been conceded, and the issues here are limited to the five specific claims, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7.\n In No. 4-hereinafter referred to as the Sanitary case-Winters and Crampton brought suit in the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the Sanitary Refrigerator Co. for infringement of the patent by the latch which it used in the manufacture of refrigerators. The Dent Hardware Co., which had manufactured and sold the latches to the Refrigerator Co., although not itself a party to the suit, employed counsel and conducted the defense of the suit at its own expense. The District Court, after a \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n hearing on pleadings and proof, held that the patent was valid and infringed, enjoined further infringement and ordered an accounting. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the defendant admitted the validity of the five specific claims, 'accompanied by the statement that validity was recognized only in view of an asserted construction which gave to each claim so narrow a field that infringement was not disclosed.' The court, finding that the sole issue remaining was one of the infringement of these claims, held that, while they were extremely narrow and were restricted to the particular structure disclosed, they had some range of equivalency and were infringed by the defendant's latch; and affirmed the decree of the District Court in respect to them. 24 F.(2d) 15, 16.\n In No. 14-hereinafter referred to as the Dent case-Winters and Crampton, after the decree of the District Court in the Sanitary case but before that of the Circuit Court of Appeals, brought a suit for infringement in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Dent Hardware Co., the manufacturer of the refrigerator latches. The District Court, on final hearing, held that as to the five specific claims the question was not as to their validity but as to their scope, there being in effect no denial of the plaintiff's right to the specific construction described, and that these claims should be so read as to restrict their right to the specific construction and was not infringed by the defendant's latches; and dismissed the bill of complaint. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the defendant again conceded that the five claims were 'valid if limited to the specific structure disclosed,' but claimed that when so limited, it did not infringe. The court, while it had grave doubt as to the validity of these claims, finding that, if valid, their scope was clearly confined to the structural design dis- \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n closed and had only a narrow range of equivalency-and not agreeing with the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Sanitary case, which meanwhile had been handed down-held that they were not infringed by the Dent latch; and affirmed 'the decree of the District Court, dismissing the bill because of noninfringement.' 28 F.(2d) 583, 586.\n There being a conflict of opinion between the two Circuit Courts of Appeals on the question of infringement, writs of certiorari were thereafter granted in both cases. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nSince both courts in the Sanitary case held the five specific claims to be valid, and neither court in the Dent case held them to be invalid, and the Hardware Co. in defending for the Refrigerator Co. in the Sanitary case and for itself in the Dent case, admitted in both Circuit Courts of Appeals that these claims were valid if limited to the specific structure disclosed, we have no occasion here to determine the question as to the validity of these claims when thus limited; especially as the petition for certiorari in the Sanitary case did not question the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in respect to the validity of these claims, but assigned as error merely its holding in reference to the question of infringement and was based solely on the conflict between the two circuits in respect to that question. 2 \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n 2. Nor have we occasion here to consider at length whether, as urged by Winters and Crampton, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirming the interlocutory order of the District Court adjudging the infringement and ordering an accounting, finally and conclusively determined the question of infringement so as to become binding upon the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The bill in the Dent case was filed before the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had been rendered. This judgment was not set up by Winters and Crampton in the Dent case by any amendment to the pleadings; nor was it even introduced in evidence in that case. In short, there is nothing in the record in that case to raise the the defense of res judicata or estoppel by judgment; and the only effect of the decree in the Seventh Circuit when called to the attention of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in argument was, at most, that which it had under the doctrine of comity, constituting a rule, not of law, but of practice, convenience and expediency; and if we thought the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 'correct upon the merits, we should not reverse its action' though we were of opinion it had not given sufficient weight to that doctrine. See Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 485, 488\n, 20 S. Ct. 708.\n\n 3. \nThis brings us to the question brought up for review by the writs of certiorari, as to whether the five specific claims of the Winters and Crampton patent were infringed by the refrigerator latches manufactured by the Dent Hardware Co. and used by the Refrigerator Co.\n So far as this question is concerned there is no substantial difference in the evidence in the two cases. As there was a concurrent finding in the two lower courts in the Sanitary case that they were infringed, and a concurrent finding in the two lower courts in the Dent case that they \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n were not infringed, and the cases have been brought here because of the conflict of decision in the two Circuit Courts of Appeals, it is clear that under these circumstances, neither properly calls for the strict application of the general rule as to the acceptance by this Court of the concurrent findings of the lower courts on questions of fact, and we consider independently the question as to which of the decisions on this question is based upon the sounder reasoning and is correct. Compare Thomson Spot Welder Co. v. Ford Motor Co., \n265 \nU.S. 445, 447\n, 44 S. Ct. 533; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 46 S. Ct. 42. Furthermore upon the undisputed evidence the question of infringement resolves itself in each case into one of law, depending upon a comparison between the structure disclosed on the face of the patent and the device shown in the Dent latch, and the correct application thereto of the rule of equivalency. Compare Singer Co. v. Cramer, \n192 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 24 S. Ct. 291.\n\n 4. \nIn the application for their patent Winters and Crampton said: 'This invention relates to a latch of the swinging lever type, particularly adapted for use on refrigerators though applicable in many other relations where a door is to be closed and held in closed position. The swinging lever latch ... is pivotally connected at one end to the door jamb or casing, allowing the door to be opened when the latch is thrown to an upper vertical position, and coming down across the meeting edges of the casing and door when swung to horizontal position, engaging with a cam member on the door to wedge the door tightly shut. This latch is a very serviceable latch but ... is liable to drop to horizontal position in which case the door cannot be closed without first raising the lever to upper vertical position while, many times, the door is inadvertently swung toward closed position and against the lever in its horizontal position with injury either to the lever or door or both. In the present inven- \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n tion, it is a primary object and purpose to provide a latch which may be pivotally connected to the door and which is automatically operated to engage with a retaining member or keeper fixed on the door casing when the door is closed irrespective of the vertical or horizontal position of the latch lever, working as well in the one case as the other. A further object of the invention is to construct a latch of few parts, whereby it may be economically made and which will be durable and efficient in service. ... The ability to close the door and latch it automatically, irrespective of the position of the latch lever insures against injury to the latch or door and also insures that the door will be latched when it is swung shut.'\n Claims 1 and 7, which are typical, read as follows:\n'1. In combination, a door and a casing therefor, a keeper attached to the casing comprising a base, an outstanding post and a head at the outer portion of the post, said head depending below the post and formed with upper and lower curved outer sides coming substantially to a point and with an inner upwardly and inwardly inclined side, a member attached to the door comprising a base, an integral outstanding post projecting from the base and a laterally extending arm at the upper end of the post paralleling the base, and a latch lever pivotally mounted between its ends between the said arm and base of said member, said lever having one arm formed with an under cam side extending from the pivot and adapted to be engaged under the depending portion of the keeper, a handle portion extending in the opposite direction from the pivot and another arm projecting from the handle portion a distance from the pivot and lying substantially at right angles to the first arm of the lever and likewise being formed with an inner cam side, substantially as and for the purposes described.'\n\n'7. In combination, a door and a casing therefor, a keeper attached to the casing, a latch lever pivotally \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n mounted on the door between its ends, one end of the lever being formed into an operating handle and the other into a keeper engaging arm, a second arm projecting from the handle portion of the lever a short distance from its pivot and at an angle to the first arm, said keeper being formed at its outer sides for engagement with the respective arms when the lever is in horizontal and vertical positions, respectively, as the door is closed, to automatically operate the lever so that it will engage under the keeper when the door is entirely closed, substantially as described.'\n\n We insert here reproductions (on a reduced scale) of Figure 4 of the drawings which is a front elevation showing the door approaching closed position with the swinging lever in vertical relation to the door; Figure 5, a side elevation thereof; Figure 6, a front elevation showing the action on the swinging lever as the door approaches closed position after the lever has been in horizontal position; and Figure 1, a front elevation showing the latch in closed position and holding a door closed. These show the patented device in detail.\n The operation of closing and latching the door is thus described in the specification:\n'When the door is moved toward closing position with the lever vertically located, the cam side 13 of arm 12 strikes against the curved upper side 18 of head 17, causing the lever to be automatically swung toward the horizontal, and bringing the arm 9 into place so as to pass under the lower point of the keeper head so that it may engage at its outer side against the wedging cam side 20 of the head. It is apparent that by giving the end of handle 11 a downward movement, the door will be wedged tightly shut as the arm 9 moves upwardly and against the incline 20. ... If the lever has dropped to horizontal position while the door is open, the closure of the door and engagement of the lever with the keeper is accomplished by merely swinging the door shut, in which case, as shown in Figs. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n and 7, the arm 9 strikes with its inclined cam side 10 against the lower curved side 19 of the head 17 of the keeper, causing the handle to be automatically turned toward vertical position. This movement continues until the arm 9 passes by the lower point of the keeper head 17 or, as usually occurs, the arm 12 comes into contact with the head at the upper side 18, whereupon the lever is actuated so as to bring the arm 9 under the depending portion of the keeper, the same as before described when closing the door with the lever in vertical position. In any case, the latch lever engages with the latch keeper when the door is closed irrespective of the position of the lever.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n While this patent came into a prior art crowded with various latch devices for holding a door in closed position \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n when it was shut and was not a pioneer patent entitled to a broad range of equivalents, the structure which it disclosed was meritorious and soon attained a large measure of commercial success.\n\n 5. \nThe Dent latch is manufactured under letters patent No. 1,575,647 for lock devices for refrigerator doors issued March 9, 1926 to T. O. Schrader, assignor of the Hardware Co. In his application for this patent Schrader said: 'I am aware of (Winters and Crampton) patent No. 1,385,102 dated July 19, 1921, and I disclaim the structure therein disclosed, as my invention is differentiated therefrom, since whereas the structure disclosed in said patent utilizes a pin 12 carried by the latch arm 11, which coacts with an upper cam edge 18 of the keeper member 17; in my novel construction the upper edge of my keeper plate b3 has no function, but the pivotal latch c6 carries a cam c1 inclined to the pivot of said latch and adapted to coact with a pin b8 carried by and laterally projecting from, the inner wall of the keeper plate b3 thereby to swing the terminal tongue of the latch into the horizontal locking position; and to none of the constructions of the prior art do I herein make claim.'\n The latch manufactured by the Hardware Co. which is involved in both these cases, differs only slightly in form from that shown in the Schrader patent. It is in the main an exact reproduction of the structure disclosed in the Winters and Crampton patent. It has like it a keeper attached to the door casing, with a triangular head, and a lever latch with a handle and two arms whose functions are to trip or give a kick to the latch lever by their coaction with the keeper head and wedge the lower arm under it, regardless of the position of the latch lever when the closing operation begins. The only differences are that in the Dent latch the keeper has on the inner or door side of the triangular head a lug projecting inwardly towards the latch lever; and the upper arm of the latch lever is a short \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 41]\n\u00a0\n inclined cam placed at the pivot of the latch lever, and so constructed and at such an angle that it rides upon and contacts with the lug on the side of the keeper head, instead of with its upper curved side as in the Winters and Crampton structure. The coaction of this shortened arm with the lug operates, however, on the cam principle, just as the coaction of the longer upper arm with the curved upper surface of the keeper head in the Winters and Crampton structure, to trip or kick the lower arm of the latch lever into the wedged position under the keeper head.\n\n 6. \nDespite the changes in the Dent latch from the Winters and Crampton structure we find that the two devices are substantially identical, operating upon the same principle, and accomplishing the same result in substantially the same way, and that the slight change in the form of the Dent latch is merely a colorable departure from the Winters and Crampton structure.\n In the Dent latch, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the lug on the inner side of the triangular head of the keeper is a part of the side of the head. And at the place where the shortened upper arm of the latch lever comes in contact with it, the surface of this lug forms in effect the upper side of the keeper head as a substitute for the upper side in the Winters and Crampton structure, which, while left in place, performs no function whatever, just as if it were cut away.\n Although the claims of the Winters and Crampton patent are limited to the structure therein disclosed, we find that they are infringed by the device of the Dent latch. Both Circuit Courts of Appeals recognized that the Winters and Crampton patent, although thus limited had some range of equivalents; and we think that, though it be a narrow one, it is sufficient.\n There is a substantial identity, constituting infringement, where a device is a copy of the thing described \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 42]\n\u00a0\n by the patentee, 'either without variation, or with such variations as are consistent with its being in substance the same thing.' Burr v. Duryee, 1 Wall. 531, 573. Except where form is of the essence of the invention, it has little weight in the decision of such an issue; and, generally speaking, one device is an infringement of another 'if it performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result. ... Authorities concur that the substantial equivalent of a thing, in the sense of the patent law, is the same as the thing itself; so that if two devices do the same work in substantially the same way, and accomplish substantially the same result, they are the same, even though they differ in name, form, or shape.' Union Paper Bag Machine Co. v. Murphy, \n97 U.S. 120\n, 125. And see Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., \n97 U.S. 126\n, 137. That mere colorable departures from the patented device do not avoid infringement, see McCormick v. Talcott, 20 How. 402, 405. A close copy which seeks to use the substance of the invention, and, although showing some change in form and position, uses substantially the same devices, performing precisely the same offices with no change in principle, constitutes an infringement. Ives v. Hamilton, \n92 U.S. 426\n, 430. And even where, in view of the state of the art, the invention must be restricted to the form shown and described by the patentee and cannot be extended to embrace a new form which is a substantial departure therefrom, it is nevertheless infringed by a device in which there is no substantial departure from the description in the patent, but a mere colorable departure therefrom. Compare Duff v. Sterling Pump Co., \n107 \nU.S. 636, 639\n, 2 S. Ct. 487.\n The fact that, as the Dent device makes two reciprocal changes in the form of the Winters and Crampton structure, one by the insertion of the lug on the keeper head, and the other in the shortened upper arm of the latch \n\n[280 U.S. 30, 43]\n\u00a0\n lever, and one alone of these changes cannot be substituted in the Winters and Crampton structure without the other, so as to make it operative, is plainly insufficient to avoid the infringement.\n Nor is the infringement avoided, under the controlling weight of the undisputed facts, by any presumptive validity that may attach to the Schrader patent by reason of its issuance after the Winters and Crampton patent.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the Sanitary case is affirmed; and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Dent case is reversed.\n No. 4 affirmed. \n No. 14\n reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Sanitary Case the petition for the writ of certiorari was filed before the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Dent case had been handed down; and was then denied. \n278 \nU.S. 599\n, 49 S. Ct. 8. But after the handing down of that opinion showing the conflict as to the question of infringement, was brought to our attention by a petition for rehearing, the certiorari was granted. \n278 \nU.S. 587\n, 49 S. Ct. 17. However, the Refrigerator Co. did not challenge the correctness of the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that the five specific claims were valid; and the petition was based entirely on the conflict of opinion as to the question of infringement. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSILVER v.

Hadden, of New Haven, Conn., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925 (28 USCA  344), from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut upholding the constitutionality of a state statute. Chapter 308 of the Public Acts of Connecticut of 1927 (printed in the margin1) \n\n[280 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n provides that no person carried gratuitously as a guest in an automobile may recover from the owner or operator for injuries caused by its negligent operation. The appellant brought suit in the superior court of New Haven county against appellee, her husband, for injuries so sustained. Judgment for the defendant was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Both courts ruled that the statute barred appellant, a guest carried gratuitously, from recovery for injuries caused by ordinary negligence in the operation of the car, and the Supreme Court, by divided bench, held that the statute did not deny to appellant the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 108 Conn. 371, 143 A. 240.\n As the record does not disclose the constitutional grounds on which the appellant challenged the validity of the statute, our review will be limited to the single question arising under the Federal Constitution which was considered in the opinion of the court below. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225. We need not, therefore, elaborate the rule that the Constitution does not forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old ones recognized by the common law, to attain a permissible legislative object. See Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell, \n274 \nU.S. 112, 116\n, 47 S. Ct. 509, 51 A. L. R. 1376; New York Central Railroad Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Wilmington Star Mining Co. v. Fulton, \n205 \nU.S. 60, 74\n, 27 S. Ct. 412.\n The use of the automobile as an instrument of transportation is peculiarly the subject of regulation. We cannot assume that there are no evils to be corrected or permissible social objects to be gained by the present statute. We are not unaware of the increasing frequency of litigation in which passengers carried gratuitously in automobiles, often casual guests or licensees, have sought the recovery of large sums for injuries alleged to have \n\n[280 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n been due to negligent operation. In some jurisdictions it has been judicially determined that a lower standard of care should be exacted where the carriage in any type of vehicle is gratuitous. See Massaletti v. Fitzroy, 228 Mass. 487, 118 N. E. 168, L. R. A. 1918C, 264, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 1088; Marcienowski v. Sanders, 252 Mass. 65, 147 N. E. 275; Epps v. Parrish, 26 Ga. App. 399, 106 S. E. 297. Whether there has been a serious increase in the evils of vexatious litigation in this class of cases, where the carriage is by automobile, is for legislative determination, and, if found, may well be the basis of legislative action further restricting the liability. Its wisdom is not the concern of courts.\n It is said that the vice in the statute is not that it distinguishes between passengers who pay and those who do not, but between gratuitous passengers in automobiles and those in other classes of vehicles. But it is not so evident that no grounds exist for the distinction that we can say a priori that the classification is one forbidden as without basis, and arbitrary. See State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S. Ct. 630\n\n\n Granted that the liability to be imposed upon those who operate any kind of vehicle for the benefit of a mere guest or licensee is an appropriate subject of legislative restruction, there is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied-that the Legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 281; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 382\n, 384 S., 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; International Harvester Co. v.

In this day of almost universal highway transportation by motorcar, we cannot say that abuses originating in the multiplicity of suits growing out of the gratuitous carriage of passengers in automobiles do not present so conspicuous an example of what the Legislature may regard as an evil, as to justify \n\n[280 U.S. 117, 124]\n\u00a0\n legislation aimed at it, even though some abuses may not be hit.

S.  102, U. S. C. tit. 2 ,  192 (2 USCA  192). He was sentenced to jail for three months and to pay a fine of $500. The case was taken to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia; that court certified to this court certain questions of law upon which it desired instruction for the proper decision of the case. We directed the entire record to be sent up. Judicial Code,  239, U. S. C. tit. 28,  346 (28 USCA  346).\n Section 102 follows: 'Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either house of Congress, to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either house, or any \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 285]\n\u00a0\n committee of either house of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100, and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.'\n By way of inducement the indictment set forth the circumstances leading up to the offense which in brief substance are as follows:\n For many years, there had been progressive diminution of petroleum necessary for the operation of naval vessels; consequently the government was interested to conserve the supply and especially that in the public domain.\n Pursuant to the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 847, the President, by executive orders dated September 2, 1912, December 13, 1912, and April 30, 1915, ordered that certain oil and gas bearing lands in California and Wyoming be held for the exclusive use of the navy. These areas were designated Naval Petroleum Reserves 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n The Act of February 25, 1920, 41 Stat. 437, provided for the leasing of public lands containing oil and other minerals. And the Act of June 4, 1920, 41 Stat. 812, 813, directed the Secretary of the Navy of take possession of all properties in the naval reserves 'on which there are no pending claims or applications for permits or leases under the' Leasing Act of February 25, 1920 'or pending applications for United States patent under any law,' to conserve, develop, use and operate the same by contract, lease or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange or sell the oil and gas products thereof for the benefit of the United States. And it was declared that the rights of any claimants under the Leasing Act were not thereby adversely affected. \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 286]\n\u00a0\n May 31, 1921, the President promulgated an executive order purporting to give the administration and conservation of all oil and gas bearing lands in the naval reserves to the Secretary of the Interior subject to supervision by the President.\n April 7, 1922, the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Interior made a lease of lands in Reserve No. 3 to the Mammoth Oil Company. This was done by the procurement of the appellant action as the president of the company. The lease purported to grant to the company the right to take oil and gas and contained a provision selling royalty oils to the company. And February 9, 1923, a supplemental contract was made by which the company agreed to furnish storage facilities for the Navy. Mammoth Oil Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 13\n, 48 S. Ct. 1.\n April 25, 1922, the same Secretaries made a contract with the Pan- American Petroleum & Transport Company for the sale to it of royalty oils from Reserves 1 and 2. December 11, 1922, another contract was made by them. The purpose of these agreements was to arrange that the company furnish storage facilities for the Navy in exchange for royalty oils to be received by the United States under leases then in force and thereafter to be made. December 11, 1922, the same Secretaries made a lease to the Pan American Petroleum Company purporting to grant to it the right to take oil and gas from Reserve No. 1. Pan American Co. v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 456\n, 47 S. Ct. 416.\n The lease to the Mammoth Company and the contract with the Transport Company came to the attention of the Senate, and it was charged that there had been fraud and bad faith in the making of them. Questions arose as to their legality, the future policy of the government as to them and similar leases and contracts, and as to the necessity and desirability of legislation upon the subject. \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 287]\n\u00a0\n April 29, 1922, the Senate adopted Resolution 282, calling upon the Secretary of the Interior for information and containing the following: 'That the committee on public lands and surveys be authorized to investigate this entire subject of leases upon naval oil reserves with particular reference to the protection of the rights and equities of the government of the United States and the preservation of its natural resources, and to report its findings and recommendations to the Senate.'\n June 5, 1922, Resolution 282 was amended by Resolution 294 by adding a provision that the committee 'is hereby authorized ... to require the attendance of witnesses by subpoenas or otherwise; to require the production of books, papers and documents. ... The chairman of the committee, or any member thereof, may administer oaths to witnesses and sign subpoenas for witnesses.'\n February 5, 1923, the Senate passed Resolution 434, which continued in force and effect until the end of the Sixty-Eighth Congress and until otherwise ordered, 'Senate Resolution 282 agreed to April 21(29), 1922, and Senate Resolution 292, agreed to May 15, 1922.' (The government suggests that, instead of the resolution last mentioned, there was meant Resolution 294 adopted June 5, 1922.)\n February 7, 1924, the Senate passed Resolution 147, directing in substance the same as it had theretofore done by the two resolutions first above mentioned and also that the committee 'ascertain what, if any, other or additional legislation may be advisable and to report its findings and recommendations to the Senate.'\n The committee proceeded to exercise the authority conferred upon it and for that purpose held hearings at which witnesses were examined and documents produced. Appellant was summoned, appeared and was sworn December 4, 1923. \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 288]\n\u00a0\n And the indictment charges that, on March 22, 1924, the matters referred to in these resolutions being under inquiry, and appellant having been summoned to give testimony and having been sworn as aforesaid did appear before the committee as a witness. The first count alleges that Senator Walsh, a member of the committee, propounded to him a question which appellant knew was pertinent to the matters under inquiry: 'Mr. Sinclair, I desire to interrogate you about a matter concerning which the committee had no knowledge or reliable information at any time when you had heretofore appeared before the committee and with respect to which you must then have had knowledge. I refer to the testimony given by Mr. Bonfils concerning a contract that you made with him touching the Teapot Dome. I wish you would tell us about that.'\n And, to explain that question, the indictment states: 'Said Hon. Thomas J. Walsh thereby meaning and intending, as said Harry F. Sinclair then and there well knew and understood, to elicit from him the said Harry F. Sinclair, facts, which then were within his knowledge, touching the execution and delivery of a certain contract bearing date September 25, 1922, made and executed by the between said Mammoth Oil Company, one F. G. Bonfils and one John Leo Stack, which was executed on behalf of said Mammoth Oil Company by said Harry F. Sinclair as President of said Mammoth Oil Company, and which, among other things, provided for the payment, by said Mammoth Oil Company, unto said F. G. Bonfils and said John Leo Stack, of the sum of $250,000, on or before October 15, 1922, in consideration of the release, by said F. G. Bonfils and said John Leo Stack, of rights to lands described in said Executive Order of April 30, 1915, and embraced in the aforesaid lease of April 7, 1922.' And that count concluded: 'And that said Harry \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 289]\n\u00a0\n F. Sinclair then and there unlawfully did refuse to answer said question . ...'\n Senate Joint Resolution 54 was approved February 8, 1924. 43 Stat. 5. It recited that the leases and contracts above mentioned were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and corruption, that they were without authority, contrary to law, and in defiance of the settled policy of the government, and the resolution declared that the lands embraced therein should be recovered and held for the purposes to which they were dedicated. It directed the President to cause suit to be instituted for the cancellation of the leases and contracts, to prosecute such other actions or proceedings, civil and criminal, as were warranted by the facts, and authorized the appointment of special counsel to have charge of the matter.\n Prior to March 22, 1924, appellant, at the request of the committee, appeared five times before it, and was sworn as alleged. March 19, 1924, a United States marshal at New York served upon him a telegram, which was in form a subpoena signed by the chairman of the committee, requiring him to appear as a witness and he did appear on March 22. Before any questions were put, he submitted a statement.\n He disclaimed any purpose to invoke protection against self- incrimination and asserted there was nothing in the transaction which could incriminate him. He emphasized his earlier appearances, testimony, production of papers and discharge from further attendance. He called attention to Joint Resolution 54, discussed its provisions, and stated that a suit charging conspiracy and fraud had been commenced against the Mammoth Company and others and that the government's motion for injunction and receivers had been granted, and that application had been made for a special grand jury to investigate the making \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 290]\n\u00a0\n of the lease. He asserted that the committee could not then investigate the matters covered by the authorization because the Senate by the adoption of the joint resolution had exhausted its power and Congress and the President had made the whole matter a judicial question which was determinable only in the courts. The statement concluded: 'I shall reserve any evidence I may be able to give for those courts to which you and your colleagues have deliberately referred all questions of which you had any jurisdiction and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee.'\n After appellant's statement, his counsel asked the privilege of presenting to the committee reasons why it did not have authority further to take testimony of appellant. In the course of his remarks he said: 'Mr. Sinclair is already under oath before the committee. ... He is on the stand now in every sense of the word, and the objection really is to any further examination of him on the subjects involved in this resolution.' Discussion followed, and a motion was made: 'That in the examination the inquiry shall not relate to pending controversies before any of the Federal courts in which Mr. Sinclair is a defendant, and which questions would involve his defense.' During a colloquy that followed, one of the members said: 'Of course we will vote it (the motion) down. ... If we do not examine Mr. Sinclair about those matters, there is not anything else to examine him about.' The motion was voted down. Then the appellant was asked the question set forth in the first count, and he said: 'I decline to answer on the advice of counsel on the same ground.'\n Appellant contends that his demurrer to the several counts of the indictment should have been sustained and that a verdict of not guilty should have been directed. To support that contention he argues that the questions related to his private affairs and to matters cognizable only in the courts wherein they were pending, and that \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 291]\n\u00a0\n the committee avowedly had departed from any inquiry in aid of legislation.\n He maintains that there was no proof of any authorized inquiry by the committee or that he was legally summoned or sworn or that the questions propounded were pertinent to any inquiry it was authorized to make, and that because of such failure he was entitled to have a verdict directed in his favor.\n He insists that the court erred in holding that the question of pertinency was one of law for the court and in not submitting it to the jury and also erred in excluding evidence offered to sustain his refusal to answer.\n\n 1. \nThe committee on public lands and surveys is one of the standing committees of the Senate. No question is raised as to the validity of its organization and existence. Under section 101 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. C. tit. 2,  191 (2 USCA  191), its chairman and any of its members are empowered to administer oaths to witnesses before it. Section 102 plainly extends to a case where a person voluntarily appears as a witness without being summoned as well as to the case of one required to attend.\n By our opinion in McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 173\n, 47 S. Ct. 319, 328 (71 L. Ed. 580, 50 A. L. R. 1), decided since the indictment now before us was found, two propositions are definitely laid down: 'One, that the two houses of Congress, in their separate relations, possess not only such powers as are expressly granted to them by the Constitution, but such auxiliary powers as are necessary and appropriate to make the express powers effective; and, the other, that neither house is invested with 'general' power to inquire into private affairs and compel disclosures, but only with such limited power of inquiry as is shown to exist when the rule of constitutional interpretation just stated is rightly applied.' And that case shows that, while the power of inquiry is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function, it must be exerted with due regard \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 292]\n\u00a0\n for the rights of witnesses, and that a witness rightfully may refuse to answer where the bounds of the power are exceeded or where the questions asked are not pertinent to the matter under inquiry.\n It has always been recognized in this country, and it is well to remember, that few if any of the rights of the people guarded by fundamental law are of greater importance to their happiness and safety than the right to be exempt from all unauthorized, arbitrary or unreasonable inquiries and disclosures in respect of their personal and private affairs. In order to illustrate the purpose of the courts well to uphold the right of privacy, we quote from some of their decisions.\n In Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, said (page 190): '... We are sure that no person can be punished for contumacy as a witness before either house, unless his testimony is required in a matter into which that house has jurisdiction to inquire, and we feel equally sure that neither of these bodies possesses the general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen.' And referring to the failure of the authorizing resolution there under consideration to state the purpose of the inquiry (page 195): 'Was it to be simply a fruitless investigation into the personal affairs of individuals? If so, the House of Representatives had no power or authority in the matter more than any other equal number of gentlemen interested for the government of their country. By 'fruitless' we mean that it could result in no valid legislation on the subject to which the inquiry referred.'\n In Re Pacific Railway Commission (Circuit Court, N. D., Cal.) 32 F. 241, Mr. Justice Field, announcing the opinion of the court, said (page 250): 'Of all the rights of the citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves, not merely protec- \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 293]\n\u00a0\n tion of his person from assault, but exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from the inspection and scrutiny of others. Without the enjoyment of this right, all other rights would lose half their value.' And the learned Justice, referring to Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, said ( page 253): 'This case will stand for all time as a bulwark against the invasion of the right of the citizen to protection in his private affairs against the unlimited scrutiny of investigation by a congressional committee.' And see concuring opinions of Circuit Judge Sawyer, page 259, at page 263, and of District Judge Sabin, page 268, at page 269.\n In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, page 478, 14 S. Ct. 1125, 1134 (38 L. Ed. 1047), Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court said: 'We do not overlook these constitutional limitations which, for the protection of personal rights, must necessarily attend all investigations conducted under the authority of Congress. Neither branch of the legislative department, still less any merely administrative body, established by Congress, possesses, or can be invested with, a general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen. ... We said in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 630, (6 S. Ct. 524)-and it cannot be too often repeated-that the principles that embody the essence of constitutional liberty and security forbid all invasions on the part of the government and its employe  of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of his life.'\n Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 \nU.S. 407\n, 29 S. Ct. 115, illustrates the unwillingness of this court to construe an Act of Congress to authorize any examination of witnesses in respect of their personal affairs. And see United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 318, 335\n, 35 S. Ct. 363.\n In Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 U.S. 298\n, pages 305, 306, 44 S. Ct. 336, 337 (68 L. Ed. 696, 32 A. L. R. 786), this court said: 'Any one who respects the spirit as well as the letter of the Fourth \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 294]\n\u00a0\n Amendment would be loath to believe that Congress intended to authorize one of its subordinate agencies to sweep all our traditions into the fire ( Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 U.S. 447\n, 479 (14 S. Ct. 1125)), and to direct fishing expeditions into private papers on the possibility that they may disclose evidence of crime. We do not discuss the question whether it could do so if it tried, as nothing short of the most explicit language would induce us to attribute to Congress that intent. ... It is contrary to the first principles of justice to allow a search through all the respondents' records, relevant or irrelevant, in the hope that something will turn up.'\n\n 2. \nBut it is clear that neither the investigation authorized by the Senate resolutions above mentioned nor the question under consideration related merely to appellant's private or personal affairs. Under the Constitution (article 4,  3) Congress has plenary power to dispose of and to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the naval oil reserves, other public lands and property of the United States. And undoubtedly the Senate had power to delegate authority to its committee to investigate and report what had been and was being done by executive departments under the Leasing Act, the Naval Oil Reserve Act, and the President's order in respect of the reserves and to make any other inquiry concerning the public domain.\n While appellant caused the Mammoth Oil Company to be organized and owned all its shares, the transaction purporting to lease to it the lands within the reserve cannot be said to be merely or principally the personal or private affair of appellant. It was a matter of concern to the United States. The title to valuable government lands was involved. The validity of the lease and the means by which it had been obtained under existing law were subjects that properly might be investigated in order \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 295]\n\u00a0\n to determine what if any legislation was necessary or desirable in order to recover the leased lands or to safeguard other parts of the public domain.\n Neither Senate Joint Resolution 54 nor the action taken under it operated to divest the Senate or the committee of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws. It may be conceded that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits; but the authority of that body, directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits.\n The record does not sustain appellant's contention that the investigation was avowedly not in aid of legislation. He relies on the refusal of the committee to pass the motion directing that the inquiry should not relate to controversies pending in court and the statement of one of the members that there was nothing else to examine appellant about. But these are not enough to show that the committee intended to depart from the purpose to ascertain whether additional legislation might be advisable. It is plain that investigation of the matters involved in suits brought or to be commenced under Senate Joint Resolution 54 might directly aid in respect of legislative action.\n\n 3. \nThere is no merit in appellant's contention that a verdict should have been directed for him because the evidence failed to show that the committee was authorized to make the inquiry, summon witnesses and administer oaths. Resolutions 282 and 294 were sufficient until the expiration of the Sixty-Seventh Congress during which they were adopted, but it is argued that Resolution 434 was not effective to extend the power of the committee. As set out in the indictment and shown by the record, \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 296]\n\u00a0\n Resolution 434 does not mention 294 or refer to the date of its adoption. The former so far as material follows: 'Resolved, that Senate Resolution 282, agreed to April 21, 1922, and Senate Resolution 292, agreed to May 15, 1922, authorizing and directing the committee on public lands and surveys to investigate the entire subject of leases upon naval oil reserves, with particular reference to the protection of the rights and equities of the government of the United States and the preservation of its natural resources, and to report its findings and recommendations to the Senate ... be ... continued in full force and effect until the end of the Sixty-Eighth Congress. The committee ... is authorized to sit ... after the expiration of the present Congress until the assembling of the Sixty-Eighth Congress and until otherwise ordered by the Senate.'\n There is enough in that resolution to show that where '292' appears 294 was meant. The subject of the investigation is specifically mentioned. That is the only matter dealt with. The sole purpose was to authorize the committee to carry on the inquiry. It would be quite unreasonable, if not indeed absurd, for the Senate to direct investigation by the committee and to allow its power to summon and swear witnesses to lapse. The context and circumstances show that Resolution 294 was intended to be kept in force. See School District No. 11 v. Chapman (C. C. A.) 152 F. 887, 893, 894.\n\n 4. \nAppellant earnestly maintains that the question was not shown to be pertinent to any inquiry the committee was authorized to make. The United States suggests that the presumption of regularity is sufficient without proof. But, without determining whether that presumption is applicable to such a matter, it is enough to say that the stronger presumption of innocence attended the accused at the trial. It was therefore incumbent upon the United States to plead and show that the question \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 297]\n\u00a0\n pertained to some matter under investigation. Appellant makes no claim that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the innuendo alleged in respect of the question; the record discloses that the proof on that point was ample.\n Congress, in addition to its general legislative power over the public domain, had all the powers of a proprietor and was authorized to deal with it as a private individual may deal with lands owned by him. United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 474\n, 35 S. Ct. 309 (59 L. Ed. 673). The committee's authority to investigate extended to matters affecting the interest of the United States as owner as well as to those having relation to the legislative function.\n Before the hearing at which appellant refused to answer, the committee had discovered and reported facts tending to warrant the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 54 and the institution of suits for the cancellation of the naval oil reserve leases. Undoubtedly it had authority further to investigate concerning the validity of such leases, and to discover whether persons, other than those who had been made defendants in the suit against the Mammoth Oil Company, had or might assert a right or claim in respect of the lands covered by the lease to that company.\n The contract and release made and given by Bonfils and Stack related directly to the title to the lands covered by the lease which had been reported by the committee as unauthorized and fraudulent. The United States proposed to recover and hold such lands as a source of supply of oil for the Navy. S. J. Res. 54. It is clear that the question so propounded to appellant was pertinent to the committee's investigation touching the rights and equities of the United States as owner.\n Moreover, it was pertinent for the Senate to ascertain the practical effect of recent changes that had been made \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 298]\n\u00a0\n in the laws relating to oil and other mineral lands in the public domain. The leases and contracts charged to have been unauthorized and fraudulent were made soon after the executive order of May 31, 1921. The title to the lands in the reserves could not be cleared without ascertaining whether there were outstanding any claims or applications for permits, leases or patents under the Leasing Act or other laws. It was necessary for the government to take into account the rights, if any there were, of such claimants. The reference in the testimony of Bonfils to the contract referred to in the question propounded was sufficient to put the committee on inquiry concerning outstanding claims possibly adverse and superior to the Mammoth Oil Company's lease. The question propounded was within the authorization of the committee and the legitimate scope of investigation to enable the Senate to determine whether the powers granted to or assumed by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Navy should be withdrawn, limited, or allowed to remain unchanged.\n\n 5. \nThe question of pertinency under section 102 was rightly decided by the court as one of law. It did not depend upon the probative value of evidence. That question may be likened to those concerning relevancy at the trial of issues in court, and it is not essentially different from the question as to materiality of false testimony charged as perjury in prosecutions for that crime. Upon reasons so well known that their repetition is unnecessary it is uniformly held that relevancy is a question of law. Greenleaf on Evidence (13th Ed.)  49; Wigmore on Evidence,  2549, 2550. And the materiality of what is falsely sworn, when an element in the crime of perjury, is one for the court. Carroll v. United States (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 951; United States v. Singleton (D. C.) 54 F. 488; Cothran v. State, 39 Miss. 541, 547. \n\n[279 U.S. 263, 299]\n\u00a0\n The reasons for holding relevancy and materiality to be questions of law in cases such as those above referred to apply with equal force to the determination of pertinency arising under section 102. The matter for determination in this case was whether the facts called for by the question were so related to the subjects covered by the Senate's resolutions that such facts reasonably could be said to be 'pertinent to the question under inquiry.' It would be incongruous and contrary to well- established principles to leave the determination of such a matter to a jury. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, supra, page 489 of 154 U. S. (14 S. Ct. 1125); Horning v. District of Columbia, \n254 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 53.\n\n 6. \nThere is no merit in appellant's contention that he is entitled to a new trial because the court excluded evidence that in refusing to answer he acted in good faith on the advice of competent counsel. The gist of the offense is refusal to answer pertinent questions. No moral turpitude is involved. Intentional violation is sufficient to constitute guilt. There was no misapprehension as to what was called for. The refusal to answer was deliberate. The facts sought were pertinent as a matter of law, and section 102 made it appellant's duty to answer. He was bound rightly to construe the statute. His mistaken view of the law is no defense. Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 85\n, 28 S. Ct. 428 (52 L. Ed. 681); Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 49\n, 33 S. Ct. 9 (57 L. Ed. 107).\n\n 7. \nThe conviction on the first count must be affirmed. There were ten counts, demurrer was sustained as to four, nolle prosequi was entered in respect of two, and conviction was had on the first, fourth, fifth and ninth counts. As the sentence does not exceed the maximum authorized as punishment for the offense charged in the first count, we need not consider any other count. Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S. Ct. 17 (63 L. Ed. 1173).\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSINCLAIR v. UNITED STATES(1929)\nNo. 748\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 749, 751]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Hoover and Charles A. Douglas, both of Washington, D. C., and Martin W. Littleton, of New York City, for Sinclair and others.\n Messrs. Daniel Thew Wright and Philip Ershler, both of Washington, D. C., for Day.\n Mr. Owen J. Roberts, of Philadelphia, Pa., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 22, 1927, the United States, by their attorney, presented to the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, a written petition for an order requiring appellants Harry F. Sinclair, William J. Burns, W. Sherman Burns, and Henry Mason Day to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of that court.\n This petition alleged:\n That on October 17, 1927, United States v. Harry F. Sinclair and Albert B. Fall, wherein the defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud, came on for trial. Twelve persons selected as jurors were sworn at 12:20 p. m., October 18th, and thereafter the United States proceeded to present evidence. The jury was respited from day to day, until November 2d, when it was discharged and a mistrial entered because of charges of improper conduct by a juror, and proof showing that 'there were a large number of operatives of the William J. Burns International Detective Agency of New York, then engaged in the District of Columbia, since October 18th, 1927, in a close, intimate, objectionable, and improper surveillance and investigation of the jurors aforesaid and the relatives, neighbors, and friends of said jurors.' \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 752]\n\u00a0\n That immediately after the jury was sworn Sinclair directed Day to engage the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, to receive reports therefrom and supervise the activities of its operatives for the following objects: 'To spy upon said jurors and each of them, to bribe, intimidate and influence said jurors and each of them, and to do anything calculated to interfere with and impede said jurors and each of them in the unbiased discharge of their duties in the trial of said cause, and to influence, pervert, impede, and prevent said jurors in the discharge of their duties as jurors, and to impede, pervert, and prevent the due administration of justice in said court in the trial of said criminal prosecution, either by corruptly influencing said jurors to decide the issues of said prosecution in favor of the defendants therein, or to disagree as to said issues, by unlawfully spying upon the said jurors and each of them for the purpose of concocting false charges against one or more of the said jurors, in case such a course should seem advantageous to said defendants in said cause, with a view of bringing about a mistrial of the cause aforesaid; or otherwise accomplish such purpose.'\n That Day employed the agency through W. Sherman Burns, an officer then in New York. On the following day fifteen named operatives were assembled in Washington and assigned to spy upon, investigate, and shadow jurors. They continued so to do until November 2d.\n That William J. Burns, then actively engaged in conducting the affairs of the detective agency, visited Washington October 12th, and 13th and arranged for the intended operations. November 3d he returned and, in pursuance of the general plan, procured a false affidavit concerning the conduct of Juror Glasscock which was presented to the trial judge.\n That operatives and employees of the detective agency investigated incumbrances on the home of one juror, \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 753]\n\u00a0\n also the affairs of his neighbors; made an investigation of the brother and father of another juror; and one of them (McMullin) falsely reported that Juror Glasscock was seen in conference with an attorney for the United States.\n That the operatives reported daily to their superior officer, who disclosed the result to Day and Sinclair, the original reports being sent to W. Sherman Burns, New York City.\n'That, at all times hereinbefore mentioned, each of the persons above named as respondents to this petition well knew all the premises aforesaid, and well knew that said criminal prosecution was being conducted in said court as aforesaid, that said prosecution was not finished, that said jurors were sworn jurors trying the issues in said cause in said court as aforesaid; that they the said respondents were not, as in fact they were not, called upon or authorized by said court, or by anybody in authority, to spy upon said jurors or any of them, or to bribe, molest, intimidate, or influence said jurors or any of them, or to do anything calculated to interfere with or impede said jurors or any of them in the unbiased discharge of their said duties, or to influence, pervert, prevent, or in any manner, or to any extent, impede, the due administration of justice in said court in the trial of said criminal prosecution, either by corruptly influencing said jurors to decide the issues of said prosecution in favor of the defendants therein, or to disagree as to said issues, by unlawfully spying upon said jurors or any of them for the purpose of concocting false charges against one or more of said jurors, in case such a course should seem advantageous to said defendants in said cause, with a view of bringing about a mistrial of the cause aforesaid.'\n\n The rule issued. Appellants presented separate answers under oath.\n The challenged the sufficiency of the petition to charge anything done in the presence of the court or near thereto \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 754]\n\u00a0\n which obstructed or impeded due administration of justice, or tended so to do. They denied any purpose to establish 'contact' between an operative and a juror, or that there was such contact; also any purpose to exert improper influence. They asserted the legal right under the circumstances to shadow jurors without contact; admitted employment of detectives who diligently followed the jurors while without the courtroom and made daily reports in respect of them.\n The answer of William J. Burns stated that since August 1921, he had not actively directed the affairs of the detective agency, and was not aware until October 31, 1927, when advised by a newspaper correspondent, that it had been employed to shadow the jury. He admitted presence in Washington October 12 and 13, 1927, but denied that his visit had any connection with employment by Sinclair or his representatives. He also denied improper connection with the false affidavit concerning juror Glasscock by William J. McMullin, alias Long, also any association, directly or indirectly, with that operative until after the mistrial. And further: 'This respondent says that had his advice been sought upon the subject he would unhesitatingly have advised that such employment was a lawful and proper practice frequently followed by the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice of the United States on behalf of the Government, as well as by private litigants, both plaintiffs and defendants, in instances where juries are not kept together during the trial of a cause.'\n The answer of W. Sherman Burns admitted that he was secretary and treasurer of the detective agency and with his brother directed its operation; that on October 18th he accepted employment from Day to watch individual members of the jury and to report whether any person sought or established contact with them; but he averred that all operatives obeyed their strict instruction to do \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 755]\n\u00a0\n nothing calculated to interfere with or intimidate any juror. He denied that he procured the making of any false affidavit or was guilty of improper conduct. And further: 'If by the statement in said petition that 'they, the said respondents, were not, as in fact they were not, called upon or authorized by said court or by anybody in authority' to spy upon the said jurors or any of them, it is meant to charge or to imply that the right to exercise surveillance of a jury empanelled in any cause is a right reserved exclusively to, and one that can be exercised only by, the government of the United States or its prosecuting officers, this respondent is advised by counsel that there is no warrant in law therefor, and this respondent is further advised by counsel that the Agency and its officers and operatives were strictly within the letter and spirit of the law in accepting the employment hereinbefore described and defined, and in doing the work thereunder, and that no contempt of this honorable court was committed thereby.'\n The answer of Harry F. Sinclair admitted that he authorized the employment through Day of operatives of the detective agency for the purpose of shadowing the members of the jury without establishing contact, and that some fifteen operatives were assembled in Washington on October 19th Who for a number of days thereafter kept the jurors under surveillance and made daily reports. He averred that he had cause to believe he had been under surveillance by representatives of the United States and feared efforts would be made unlawfully to influence the jury. Also that in the circumstances he rightly put the jury under observation. And further: 'Having in mind the matters and things herein set forth, and believing that in cases involving great public interest the government from time to time had kept jurors under surveillance during the time of such trials, and, entertaining such belief that the government of the United States had exercised \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 756]\n\u00a0\n such right and privilege, he believed that he, as a citizen of the United States, had the same right and privilege.'\n The answer of Henry Mason Day admitted that by direction of Sinclair he engaged the services of the detective agency, supervised their activities, received their reports, and forwarded the same to Sinclair as deemed expedient. He alleged that he had reason to believe an attempt would be made unlawfully to influence the jury, and that he had the right to cause the operatives to observe the jurors with the view of detecting any unlawful interference. He admitted that detectives were assembled in Washington and assigned to shadow the jurors and make reports; but he expressly denied any purpose improperly to influence or permit any operatives to establish contacts with them. He further said: 'As the representative, friend and business associate of Harry F. Sinclair, this respondent, after consultation with him and instructions from him, did take part in the employment of the said Burns International Detective Agency, as he had a right to do, and this respondent did, as he had a right to do, give instructions to representatives of the said Burns International Detective Agency who were in charge of its operatives, to observe as far as they lawfully could, what persons, if any, came in contact with the said jurors during the recesses of Court, and detect, so far as it was lawfully possible so to do, whether any person or persons, endeavored or undertook improperly and unlawfully to approach and communicate with any of said jurors for the purpose of improperly influencing them in the decision of the said cause.'\n It is not questioned that counsel for the United States presented evidence to the court showing the activities of Burns detectives in shadowing jurors, also the misconduct of one of the jurors, and that by reason of these things a mistrial was entered on November 2d in United States v. Sinclair & Fall. \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 757]\n\u00a0\n Trial upon the charge of contempt under the petition and answers above summarized commenced December 5, 1927, and terminated February 21, 1928. Much evidence was taken in open court-the condensation for the record occupies more than 750 printed pages. The appellants, except Sinclair, testified; also the fourteen operatives who shadowed the jurymen. Their daily reports were presented-more than 200 of them. These showed the details of the shadowing of each juror-except Flora, described in the sketch of him as a 'bull-headed man.' More than a hundred witnesses were called. During the hearing on question of guilt counsel made proffer of many witnesses to come from all parts of the United States for the purpose of showing that for a long time United States attorneys throughout the Union, under direction of the Department of Justice, by agents of the Department as distinguished from local marshals, had indulged in the custom of shadowing jurors, also to show indulgence in such practices on different occasions. This proffer was rejected.\n Charged with conspiracy to defraud, Sinclair and Fall were put on trial October 17th, in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia. The jury- ten men and two women-was selected and finally sworn about midday October 18th. The Court made no order to lock them up. There was no request therefor. Immediately thereafter (about 3:30 o'clock) Sinclair gave biographical sketches of the jurors, secured by counsel before the trial began, to Day and instructed him to employ the William J. Burns International Detective Agency to supply a corps of operatives who should shadow them. On the 19th some fifteen operatives, including a manager, field men, etc., were assembled in Washington. One of them was assigned to each juror, except Flora, with instructions to go to the courtroom, identify and thereafter to keep his subject under as strict surveillance as possible 'outside of the court,' and report to the manager. \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 758]\n\u00a0\n Day delivered the biographical sketches to Manager Ruddy. The latter testified: 'At the first meeting with Mr. Day he told me that he wished daily reports made from each operative. We did that. I designated the jurors to the operatives by numbers that I obtained from the list given me by Mr. Day. As I understand it was the position they sat in the jury box, and they counted from left to right. I was never in the court room. I had a newspaper photograph of the jurors. I told the operatives which of the jurors they were to follow. I did not show them the picture at that time. I got it later. It was not given me by Mr. Day. I instructed each one of the agents to come down to the court room to pick up his particular juror. When the jurors left the court room, the operatives were instructed to hold them under surveillance until they went home, and up to a reasonable hour at night. All the operatives reported to me each day.'\n For some days these instructions were carried out. Jurors were kept under strict surveillance from early morning until late at night-11, 12, 3 o'clock, whenever not actually within the courthouse. Daily reports were turned in and their contents conveyed to Day. On October 24th a majority of the operatives were sent away and the remainder concentrated their efforts upon three jurors whose history did not indicate strength of character. Investigation was made concerning incumbrances upon the home of one of these; also to determine whether another had indicated his views during the trial. A report by Operative McMullin October 22, 1927, purposely and falsely stated that the third (Glasscock) had consulted a representative of the United States.\n The evidence does not disclose that any operative was instructed to approach, or did approach, a juror; nor does it disclose that any juror actually knew that he was being \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 759]\n\u00a0\n shadowed. Some were suspicious. The court did not know, nor does it appear that Sinclair's counsel knew, the jury was being shadowed.\n Called as a witness, Day gave rather full account of himself from his youth up, including his army service. He was not permitted to say that he had knowledge of a practice by United States attorneys to shadow juries in criminal cases after they were sworn.\n He testified: The first conversation I had with Sinclair upon the subject of shadowing the jury was about 3 p. m. on October 18, 1927, 'after Mr. Sinclair had come back from Court. ... We were at the Mayflower Hotel in Suite 1031, and Mr. Sinclair stated that he was terribly disappointed that the jury had not been locked up, and that he was very much exercised, that some of his enemies, competitors, and those who had written us so many malicious letters might in some way try to influence this jury, and stated he wanted me to tell one of the secretaries to call up Jeffries in New York and ask him to have one of the Burnses Communicate with me at a place which would be convenient for me, and that he wanted from 12 to 14 operatives, with a lieutenant and a captain, sent to Washington to cover those who were sworn as jurors in this case. He said they were to cover these jurors, not to approach them, not to speak to them, not to in any way come in contact with them. They were simply to observe and report any suspicious acts which in their opinion might be done by the respective jurors, or those coming in contact with them, and to report also, if it was feasible, the people who did come in contact with them in a way which the operatives could do without arousing suspicion. That is the substance of the instructions.'\n Sinclair did not take the stand. The operatives severally testified that they were instructed in harmony with Sinclair's directions to Day and acted accordingly. \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 760]\n\u00a0\n On November 2d and 3d William J. Burns was in Washington apparently with the purpose of doing something to offset criticism of the detective agency aroused by the disclosures concerning surveillance of the jury. He consulted with Operative McMullin and procured the making of an affidavit by the latter based upon the false report of October 22, 1927, concerning Juror Glasscock and caused it to be presented to the presiding judge. A few days later he spoke of efforts by parties representing the United States to tamper with the jury and the affidavit of McMullin to that effect.\n The trial judge held the petition stated a case upon which appellants might be adjudged guilty of contempt and the evidence showed their guilt. Among other things, he said: 'I cannot escape the conviction, therefore, that respondent Sinclair, respondent Day, respondent Sherman Burns and respondent W. J. Burns, have been, perhaps in different degrees, all involved, more or less directly involved, in the establishment of this surveillance, a surveillance which I have already announced in my opinion constituted an obstruction to the administration of justice by this Court. If it had not been for that surveillance, from aught that appears in this testimony, there never would have been a mistrial in this case, a surveillance that at least in part, together with the publication of the affidavit regarding it, but at least in part, necessitated a mistrial.'\n After close of the evidence and arguments and after the court had declared appellants were guilty of contempt, counsel announced that upon the question of mitigation they re-offered the evidence tendered but excluded during the main case as to the custom of the Department of Justice to place juries under surveillance. This was overruled. Before sentence each appellant was called upon to make such statement as he might desire. \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 761]\n\u00a0\n W. Sherman Burns was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000; Sinclair to imprisonment for six months; Day for four months; and William J. Burns for fifteen days.\n Appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals. That court certified certain questions here for instructions. Thereafter, we directed the entire record to be sent up for our consideration.\n Both Sinclair and William J. Burns were in Washington on October 12 and 13, 1927, but there is no evidence of communication between them at that time. Sinclair had been a client of the Burns Agency. Circumstances connected with the making and filing of the false affidavit by McMullin, alias Long, based upon his false report of October 22d concerning Juror Glasscock, and its presentation to the court on November 4th, also certain statements then or thereafter made by him, might reasonably cause one to suspect William J. Burns was party to the plan for surveillance. But he emphatically denied this, and we can find no material evidence to support the charge against him. As to him, the judgment below must be reversed.\n The Act of Congress approved March 2, 1831, 4 Stat. chap. 99, p. 487 ,  1 provides:\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the power of the several courts of the United States to issue attachments and inflict summary punishments for contempts of court, shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person or persons in the presence of the said courts, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, the misbehavior of any of the officers of the said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any officer of the said courts, party, juror, wit- \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 762]\n\u00a0\n ness, or any other person or persons, to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts.'\n\n Section 2 is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Section 1 of that act became R. S.  725; Judicial Code,  268; U. S. Code, title 28,  385 (28 USCA  385). The substance of section 2 appears in sections 5399 and 5404, R. S.; Federal Criminal Code,  135; U. S. Code, title 18,  241 (18 USCAs 241). See Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289\n, 9 S. Ct. 77; Savin, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n, 9 S. Ct. 699.\n Counsel maintain that the petition does not adequately charge and the record fails to show misbehavior by appellants which obstructed the administration of justice within section 268, Judicial Code, since there is neither averment nor evidence that any operative actually approached or communicated with a juror, or attempted so to do, or that any juror was conscious of observation. The insistence is that to establish misbehavior within that section it was essential to show some act both known by a juror and probably sufficient to influence his mind. We cannot accept this view. It would destroy the power of courts adequately to protect themselves-to enforce their right of selfpreservation. Suppose, for example, some litigant should endeavor to shoot a juror while sitting in the box during progress of the cause. He might escape punishment for contempt if some quick-witted attendant quietly thwarted \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 763]\n\u00a0\n the effort and kept the circumstances secret until the trial ended.\n Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 418\n, 421 S., 38 S. Ct. 560, adjudged the company guilty of contempt by publishing, in the city where the court was sitting, articles concerning a pending equity case. Counsel there maintained that it was not alleged, proved, or found that any of the publications was brought into the court building or read by the judge, and therefore he lacked power to punish under section 268, Judicial Code. Also that publication of newspaper articles outside the courtroom was not misbehavior amounting to contempt unless actually known to the judge. Replying, this court, through Mr. Chief Justice White, said:\n'Clarified by the matters expounded and the ruling made in the Marshall Case (Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 \nU.S. 521\n, 37 S. Ct. 448, L. R. A. 1917F, 279, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 371), there can be no doubt that the provision (section 268) conferred no power not already granted and imposed no limitations not already existing. ... The provision therefore, conformably to the whole history of the country, not minimizing the constitutional limitations nor restricting or qualifying the powers granted, by necessary implication recognized and sanctioned the existence of the right of self-preservation, that is, the power to restrain acts tending to obstruct and prevent the untrammeled and unprejudiced exercise of the judicial power given by summarily treating such acts as a contempt and punishing accordingly. The test, therefore, is the character of the act done and its direct tendency to prevent and obstruct the discharge of judicial duty,-a conclusion which necessarily sustains the view of the statute taken by the courts below. ...\n\n'True, it is urged that, although the matters which were made the basis of the findings were published at the place where the proceedings were pending and under the cir- \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 764]\n\u00a0\n cumstances which we have stated in a daily paper having large circulation, as it was not shown that they had been seen by the presiding judge or had been circulated in the court room, they did and could form no basis for an inference of guilt. But the situation is controlled by the reasonable tendencies of the acts done and not by extreme and substantially impossible assumptions on the subject. Again, it is said there is no proof that the mind of the judge was influenced or his purpose to do his duty obstructed or restrained by the publications and, therefore, there was no proof tending to show the wrong complained of. But here again not the influence upon the mind of the particular judge is the criterion but the reasonable tendency of the acts done to influence or bring about the baleful result is the test. In other words, having regard to the powers conferred, to the protection of society, to the honest and fair administration of justice and to the evil to come from its obstruction, the wrong depends upon the tendency of the acts to accomplish this result without reference to the consideration of how far they may have been without influence in a particular case. The wrongdoer may not be heard to try the power of the judge to resist acts of obstruction and wrongdoing by him committed as a prelude to trial and punishment for his wrongful acts.'\n\n Under the doctrine so stated, we think the trial judge rightly held it unnecessary to allege or show actual contact between an operative of the detective agency and a juror, or that any juror had knowledge of being observed. The reasonable tendency of the acts done is the proper criterion. Neither actual effect produced upon the juror's mind nor his consciousness of extraneous influence was an essential element of the offense.\n That the acts here disclosed, and for which three of the appellants were certainly responsible, tended to obstruct the honest and fair administration of justice, we cannot \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 765]\n\u00a0\n doubt. The jury is an essential instrumentality-an appendage-of the court, the body ordained to pass upon guilt or innocence. Exercise of calm and informed judgment by its members is essential to proper enforcement of law. The most exemplary resent having their footsteps dogged by private detectives. All know that men who accept such employment commonly lack fine scruples, often willfully misrepresent innocent conduct and manufacture charges. The mere suspicion that he, his family, and friends are being subjected to surveillance by such persons is enough to destroy the equilibrium of the average juror and render impossible the exercise of calm judgment upon patient consideration. If those fit for juries understand that they may be freely subjected to treatment like that here disclosed, they will either shun the burdens of the service or perform it with disquiet and disgust. Trial by capable juries, in important cases, probably would become an impossibility. The mistrial of November 2d indicates what would often happen. We can discover no reason for emasculating the power of courts to protect themselves against this odious thing. See United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 575\n, 27 S. Ct. 165, 8 Ann. Cas. 265.\n The acts complained of were sufficiently near the court. Most of them were within the courtroom, near the door of the courthouse, or within the city. Certainly, they were not less remote than the publication denounced in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States. There was probable interference with an appendage of the court while in actual operation; the inevitable tendency was towards evil, the destruction, indeed, of trial by jury. In re Savin, Petitioners, supra.\n During the hearing and before conviction of guilt, counsel proffered many witnesses by whom they proposed to show a practice of the Department of Justice to cause its officers to shadow jurors. This evidence was rightly excluded. That Department is not a lawmaker and mis- \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 766]\n\u00a0\n takes or violations of law by it give no license for wrongful conduct by others.\n After the judge had declared appellants guilty, counsel offered in mitigation of punishment the same evidence concerning the alleged custom of the Department of Justice theretofore tendered on the issue of guilt. The tender was refused. Very many witnesses, who it was said would testify to such custom, had been proffered and the proposed evidence rejected; all were again tendered. The offer did not limit the proposal to the appellants' knowledge or belief or mental state. They had answered under oath, with full opportunity to present whatever they deemed important. Before sentence each was accorded opportunity to make a statement. There was no request for permission to file affidavits. Counsel were fully heard. In the circumstances, the court did not exceed the limits of proper discretion.\n Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 537\n, 538 S., 45 S. Ct. 390, is relied upon. There, we declared: 'Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of constempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed. ... In cases like this, where the intention with which acts of contempt have been committed must necessarily and properly have an important bearing on the degree of guilt and the penalty which should be imposed, the court can not exclude evidence in mitigation.'\n By this language we did not intend to lay down any new or hard and fast rule concerning evidence to be heard in mitigation in proceedings for contempt; and certainly there was no purpose to restrict the discretion of the trial \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 767]\n\u00a0\n judge in such cases more narrowly than in ordinary criminal trials. See Wharton's Criminal Procedure (10th Ed.)  1890. Moreover, the conscious purpose of Cooke was regarded as an essential element of the offense charged.\n Always the language used in an opinion must be read in the light of the issues presented. Cooke was not accorded due opportunity at any stage of the proceedings to state the facts which might excuse or mitigate his conduct, and the words quoted were addressed to that situation. Here there was abundant opportunity for presentation of anything really important.\n Under the circumstances here disclosed, to hear the many witnesses offered by counsel would have required unnecessary and intolerable extension of the long drawn out trial without material benefit. The answers relied or might have relied upon the knowledge possessed by appellants. By short affidavit or verbal statement any appellant could have advised the court again concerning facts within his knowledge, his beliefs, or general state of mind-matters which might possibly affect the degree of guilt.\n The exclusion of some other evidence is assigned as error; but we think the claim is without merit and demands no extended comment.\n Objections are offered to the admission of certain evidence. In answer, we need only refer to what was said in United States v. King, 7 How. 833, 854, 855 (12 L. Ed. 934): 'In some unimportant particulars, the evidence objected to was not admissible. But where the court decides the fact and the law without the intervention of a jury, the admission of illegal testimony, even if material, is not of itself a ground for reversing the judgment, nor is it properly the subject of a bill of exceptions. If evidence appears to have been improperly admitted, the appellate court will reject it, and proceed to decide the case as if it was not in the record.' \n\n[279 U.S. 749, 768]\n\u00a0\n Considering the whole record, we think appellants had a patient hearing upon adequately defined issues, with abundant opportunity to put forward all proper defenses and explanations. With the exception already stated, there is ample evidence to support the judgment; the punishments imposed are not excessive; the court kept within the limits of its reasonable discretion and did nothing which injuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties. Judicial Code,  269; U. S. Code, title 28,  391 (28 USCA  391).\n The judgment as to William J. Burns must be reversed; as to the other appellants it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or determination of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 2.

The petition contained three counts, none of which questioned the validity of a state statute.\n Upon motion, the District Court dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction, and thereafter allowed a broad appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The latter (O'Connor v. Slaker, 22 F.(2d) 147) held the cause was properly dismissed as to the state, but that under two counts of the petition jurisdiction existed as to the administrator, appellant here. It accordingly reversed the action of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The administrator then sought and secured allowance of an appeal to this court.\n Manifestly, the decree below is not final. Under the Act of February 13, 1925, amending Judicial Code,  240(b), 28 USCA  347(b), appeals to this court from Circuit Courts of Appeal lie only from final judgments or decrees (Martinez v. International Banking Corp., \n220 \nU.S. 214, 223\n, 31 S. Ct. 408; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 40 S.

Stats. (Sec. 878, U. S. Code (28 USCA  878)) provides:\n'Where, upon a writ of error, judgment is affirmed in the Supreme Court or a circuit court of appeals, the court shall adjudge to the respondents in error just damages for his delay, and single or double costs, at its discretion.'\n\n Sec. 1012, Rev. Stats. (omitted from Judicial Code in its present form provides:\n'Appeals from the district courts shall be subject to the same rules, regulations, and restrictions as are or may be prescribed in law in cases of writs of error.' 28 USCA  880.\n\n The thirtieth (formerly twenty-third) rule of this court provides:\n\n 2. \nIn all cases where an appeal delays proceedings on the judgment of the lower court, and appears to have been sued out merely for delay, damages at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent., in addition to interest, may be awarded upon the amount of the judgment.\n\n 3. \nParagraphs 1 and 2 of this rule shall be applicable to decrees for the payment of money in cases in equity, unless otherwise specially ordered by this court.\n The above provisions were considered in Deming v.

Together those cases determine that, where a writ of error or appeal is dismissed because the alleged ground therefor is so unsubstantial as to be frivolous, a penalty may be imposed. In the first cited case, writ of error to state court, penalty of 5 per centum was imposed upon the plaintiff in error; in the second, an appeal from federal court, the appellant was subjected to penalty of $1,500 and required to pay the costs.

Under the order of the court the receiver sold the personal property of the corporation and reduced the same to cash, which he held for distribution. On March 1, 1921, and March 1, 1922, Spokane and Whitman counties, of the state of Washington, had assessed against the personal property of the company the total amounts of $6,195.38 and $410. 36 respectively, but the taxes were \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n not paid and the proceeds of the subsequent sale of assets by the receiver were deposited in court. On September 23, 1924, Spokane county assessed the money in the hands of the receiver for the years 1923 and 1924, and levied taxes thereupon in the total amount of $1,390.10. On December 20, 1926, Spokane county made a further assessment and levy on the moneys in the hands of the receiver for the years 1925 and 1926 in the total amount of $1,229.52.\n The United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on February 28, 1923, and May 2, 1923, assessed federal income taxes and penalties for the years 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920 in the total amount of $70,268.58. But none of these taxes or penalties were paid.\n The funds in the hands of the receiver are insufficient to pay in full the claims of the United States, and Spokane and Whitman counties. By proper pleadings, issues were made presenting the question of the comparative priorities in distribution of the fund in his hands. The superior court held that the two counties were entitled to priority not only as to the county taxes levied against the corporation but for the county taxes for 1923-1926 assessed on the money in the receiver's hands. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Washington, the judgment was reversed and priority awarded to the United States. Exchange Nat. Bank of Spokane v. U. S., 147 Wash. 176, 265 P. 722.\n Section 3466 of the Revised Statutes provides in part that 'whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.'\n The Constitution (article 1,  8) provides that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry this and its other powers into execution. Article 6 of \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 87]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution declares that the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land.\n The constitutional validity of the priority of claims of the United States against insolvent debtors, declared in section 3466, was established by this court very early in the history of the government. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358. But it was not established, as between debts owing to the states and debts owing to the United States, until after a critical controversy between those who looked to the maintenance of the supremacy of the national government and those who were anxious to sustain undiminished the power of the states.\n Section 3466, R. S., was section 5 of an act entitled 'An act to provide more effectually for the settlement of accounts between the United States, and receivers of public money,' enacted in 1797 (chapter 20, 1 Stat. 515). It was amended by an act of 1799 (section 65, c. 22, 1 Stat. 676).\n The language has been varied very little since these original enactments. The whole act of 1797 come up for consideration in United States v. Fisher. There seems to have been a division among the judges. Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the court, which upheld the priority of the United States as against the claims of the states, and held that the act extended not only to revenue officers and persons accountable for public money, but to debtors generally. The Chief Justice said (page 396):\n'If the act has attempted to give the United States a preference in the case before the court, it remains to inquire whether the Constitution obstructs its operation. ...\n\n'The government is to pay the debt of the Union, and must be authorized to use the means which appear to itself most eligible to effect that object. It has consequently a right to make remittances by bills or otherwise, \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 88]\n\u00a0\n and to take those precautions which will render the transaction safe.\n\n'This claim of priority on the part of the United States will, it has been said, interfere with the right of the state sovereignties respecting the dignity of debts, and will defeat the measures they have a right to adopt to secure themselves against delinquencies on the part of their own revenue officers.\n\n'But this is an objection to the Constitution itself. The mischief suggested, so far as it can really happen, is the necessary consequence of the supremacy of the laws of the United States on all subjects to which the legislative power of Congress extends.'\n\n This case was decided in 1805. Later that year the question arose in a Pennsylvania state court. United States v. Nicholls, 4 Yeates, 251. Nicholls was indebted to the United States, and on June 9, 1798, executed a mortgage to the United States supervisor of the revenue for the use of the United States. There was a levy upon the lands of Nicholls, and they were sold for $14,530. The money was deposited in the hands of the prothonotary of the court, subject to the court's order. Nicholls made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, and a commission of bankruptcy issued against him. The Attorney General relied on this same fifth section of the act of 1797, and the issue arose whether, in the distribution of that fund, the laws of Pennsylvania giving a preference to that state in the payment should prevail over the federal act of 1797. Mr. Justice Yeates, speaking for the court, said (page 259):\n'Congress have the concurrent right of passing laws to protect the interest of the Union, as to debts due to the government of the United States arising from the public revenue; but in so doing, they cannot detract from the uncontrollable power of individual states to raise their own revenue, nor infringe on, or derogate from the sovereignty of any independent state. ... The rights of \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 89]\n\u00a0\n the general government to priority of payment, and the rights of individual states, are contemplated as subsisting at the same time, and as perfectly compatible with each other. This only can be effected by giving preference to each existing lien, according to its due priority in point of time. I know of no other mode whereby the several conflicting claims can with justice be protected and secured.'\n\n The colleagues of Judge Yeates concurred with him, but one of them expressed regret that the opinion in the Fisher Case, supra, delivered previously, had not been furnished for comparison. The decisions in the Fisher and the Nicholls Cases created much popular excitement, and, united with other issues of a similar character as between the supporters of the federal government and the state governments, led to much concern over the open defiance of the decision of this court, until the issues were disposed of in the case of United States v. Judge Peters, 5 Cranch, 115. See the account of the litigation in Charles Warren's Supreme Court in United States History, vol. 1, 372, 538 et seq. Four years after the decision in the Nicholls Case, a review of that case was sought in this court on a writ of error. When it came to be heard after nine years more of inaction, it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, on the ground that the record did not disclose the insolvency of the debtor, so as to make section 3466 applicable, and thus was eliminated the federal question. 4 Wheat. 311.\n No question of the construction of section 3466 seems to have come before this court again until, in Field v. United States, 9 Pet. 182, it was sought to make certain trustees liable from their own funds, because they had made disbursements out of a bankrupt's estate, as to which the United States was entitled to priority. It was objected that the distribution had been made under order of the parish court in an action in which the United States was \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 90]\n\u00a0\n not a party. This court held that the United States was not bound to become a party and said, at page 201:\n'The local laws of the state could not, and did not, bind them (the United States) in their rights. They could not create a priority in favor of other creditors, in cases of insolvency, which should supersede that of the United States.'\n\n The power of the Congress of the United States in giving preference to the debts of the government of the United States over those of the separate states is very clearly brought out in Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, which may well be referred to here, because there are some expressions in that opinion which, taken away from their context, have been used to give an erroneous view.\n After discussing the taxing powers of the national and state governments, the court, speaking by Chief Justice Chase, said of the state power of taxation (at page 77):\n'It is indeed a concurrent power, and in the case of a tax on the same subject by both governments, the claim of the United States, as the supreme authority, must be preferred; but with this qualification it is absolute. The extent to which it shall be exercised, the subjects upon which it shall be exercised, and the mode in which it shall be exercised, are all equally within the discretion of the Legislatures to which the states commit the exercise of the power. That discretion is restrained only by the will of the people expressed in the state Constitutions or through elections, and by the condition that it must not be so used as to burden or embarrass the operations of the national government.'\n\n In United States v. Snyder, \n149 \nU.S. 210\n, 13 S. Ct. 846, the question was raised whether the tax system of the United States could be made subject to the recording liens of the states. This court said, at page 214 (13 S. Ct. 848):\n'... The grant of the power and its limitations are wholly inconsistent with the proposition that the states \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 91]\n\u00a0\n can by legislation interfere with the assessment of federal taxes . ...'\n\n In United States v. San Juan County (D. C.) 280 F. 120, and in Stover v. Scotch Hills Coal Co. (D. C.) 4 F.(2d) 748, section 3466 came directly under consideration, and the priority of the United States against that of the states was fully sustained. It was also sustained by an unreported decision of the District Court of the Eastern District of Washington, in a proceeding relating to the very taxes here involved, but the judgment was reversed for lack of jurisdiction because the jurisdiction of the state courts had first attached. Merryweather v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.( 2d) 407.\n Petitioners rely on Ferris v. Chic-Mint Gum Co., 14 Del. Ch. 232, 124 A. 577, where there were several claimants-a mortgagee, the state, and the United States. Under R. S.  3186 (26 USCA  115), the mortgagee was given priority over the United States. By state law, the state was preferred to the mortgagee. The Chancellor allowed the claims in the order of the state, the mortgagee, and the United States, holding that, 'when the government agreed by section 3186 to take rank after the mortgagee, it must necessarily follow that it is subordinate in rank to those who are superior to its immediate senior.' The Chancellor observed that his conclusion arose out of the peculiar facts of the case, and that it was unnecessary for him to venture into the broad field of constitutional law. Without concurring in the conclusion of the Chancellor, it is enough to say that, as there is no such third creditor here, the case is not in point. Moreover it is contended by the government that the relative priorities could have been maintained in that case by setting apart sufficient funds to pay the mortgage before paying the federal taxes and then providing for payment of the state tax out of the sum so set apart.\n In United States v. National Surety Co., \n254 \nU.S. 73\n, 41 S. Ct. 29, the question was whether, in the distribution of a bank \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 92]\n\u00a0\n rupt's estate, the United States had priority over a surety company entitled to subrogation under section 3468 of the Revised Statutes. Upon this point this court said (page 76 (41 S. Ct. 30)):\n'The priority secured to the United States by section 3466 is priority over all other creditors; that is, private persons and other public bodies.'\n\n After these cases came the case of United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253\n, 43 S. Ct. 295, in which the question was of the application of section 3466 to the liquidation of a state bank under the state law and of priority of debts of the United States in such a case. This court found that the section did not apply, because there did not appear to be insolvency of the bank as used therein. But the court had to consider the meaning and effect of the section, and said (page 260 (43 S. Ct. 298)):\n'Where the debtor is divested of his property in one of the modes specified in the act, the person who becomes invested with the title is made trustee for the United States and bound first to pay its debt out of the debtor's property. Beaston v. Farmers' Bank of Delaware, 12 Pet. 102, 133-135 (9 L. Ed. 1017). The priority given the United States cannot be impaired or superseded by state law.'\n\n Section 3466 was fully considered in the case of Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492\n, 46 S. Ct. 180, and its history from 1789 clearly traced. See, also, United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corp., \n269 \nU.S. 504\n, 46 S. Ct. 179; Bramwell v. U. S. Fidelity Co ., \n269 \nU.S. 483\n, 46 S. Ct. 176; Stripe v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 503\n, 46 S. Ct. 182. In these cases the word 'debts' used in the section was held to include taxes. The court said in the Price Case, citing an opinion (U. S. v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35) of Mr. Justice Story (page 499 of 269 U. S. ( 46 S. Ct. 181)):\n'The claim of the United States does not rest upon any sovereign prerogative; but the priority statutes were enacted to advance the same public policy which governs in the cases of royal prerogative; that is, to secure adequate public revenue to sustain the public burdens. United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 93]\n\u00a0\n 35 (8 L. Ed. 308). And to that end ( 3466) is to be construed liberally. Its purpose is not to be defeated by unnecessarily restricting the application of the word 'debts' within a narrow or technical meaning.'\n\n The foregoing citations certainly make it clear that the United States has power, in order to collect its taxes and its revenues and debts due it, to confer priority for them over those of the states.\n There remains only to determine what priority it has conferred. It may withhold it or vary it, and it has sometimes done so. When in this case did the priority attach and apply? It was said in United States v. Oklahoma, \n261 \nU.S. 253, 260\n, 43 S. Ct. 295, that in a case like this it applied when the receiver was appointed. The appointment was on August 28, 1922. The taxes and penalties due the United States, amounting to $70,268.58, were assessed on February 28 1923, and May 2, 1923, and therefore the priority of the United States attached on or before those dates. No assessment by the counties upon specific property in the hands of the receiver was made until September 23, 1924. The claim of the United States, therefore, had priority over such claims.\n Assessments for Spokane County for $6,195.38, and of Whitman county for $410.36, were made in 1921 and 1922 before the receiver was appointed. What is the effect of those claims against the fund in court? In Wilberg v. Yakima County, 132 Wash. 219, 231 P. 931, 41 A. L. R. 184, it is held that the amount of the tax is the personal obligation of the person who owned the property at the time of the assessment and that the tax is to be collected, if the property still continues in the hands of the person against whom it was assessed, from the property; if that specific property does not exist in such hands, the amount of the tax may be collected as a lien upon all the real and personal property of the person assessed, and may be collected from the other personal or real property of such person by seizure, \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 94]\n\u00a0\n distraint, or other specific proceedings. It would seem to follow that a lien for these particular taxes could not interfere with the priority of the United States, for there is nothing in this record to show that distraint by the sheriff or any of the necessary procedure mentioned in the statute followed.\n From the judgment of the majority of the Supreme Court of Washington in this case, we must infer that the liens of the two counties for the taxes levied before the receiver was appointed and not collected were not specific. This is really a state question. It is explained by the concurring opinion of Judge Parker, as follows:\n'I concur in the result reached in the foregoing majority opinion solely upon the ground that this tax debt due to the United States, viewed apart from any supporting lien right, has priority over this tax debt due the state of Washington, viewed apart from any supporting lien right. It seems clear to me that each of these two tax debts primarily came into existence by the levy of a tax in personam, and not by the levy of a tax in rem. I think a critical reading of the revenue legislation of the respective sovereignties, the United States and the state, and the record in this case showing the manner of the levying of these respective taxes, will render this plain. The revenue legislation of each has prescribed procedure by which its personam tax debts may be made specific liens upon property of one personally owing such tax debt. This record, I think, warrants the conclusion that neither the United States, the state of Washington, nor Spokane county for the state of Washington, has ever, by the prescribed statutory procedure, prefected its inchoate tax lien right against any of the property of which the funds here in question are the proceeds. I, therefore, view these respective tax debts wholly apart from any supporting lien right. Thus I think the question of which 'shall be first satisfied' out of these funds is determinable by the language of section 3466, ... \n\n[279 U.S. 80, 95]\n\u00a0\n quoted in the majority opinion, and hence must be determinable in favor of the United States.'\n\n Whatever might have been the effect of more completed procedure in the perfecting of the liens under the law of the state, upon the priority of the United States herein, the attitude of the state court relieves us of consideration of it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST.

Of those specially important here, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 are copied in the margin;* 4 and 6 follow:\n'(4) ... For the purposes of this section, such aggregate value of the property of the carriers shall be determined \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 479]\n\u00a0\n by the Commission from time to time and as often as may be necessary. The Commission may utilize the results of its investigation under section 19a of this Act, in so far as deemed by it available, and shall give due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 480]\n\u00a0\n land for rate-making purposes, and shall give to the property investment account of the carriers only that consideration which under such law it is entitled to in establishing values for rate- making purposes. Whenever pursuant to section 19a of this Act the value of the railway property of any carrier held for and used in the service of transportation has been finally ascertained, the value so ascertained shall be deemed by the Commission to be the value thereof for the purpose of determining such aggregate value.'\n\n'(6) ... If, under the provisions of this section, any carrier receives for any year a net railway operating income in excess of 6 per centum of the value of the railway property held for and used by it in the service of transportation, one-half of such excess shall be placed in a reserve fund established and maintained by such carrier, and the remaining one-half thereof shall, within the first four months following the close of the period for which such computation is made, be recoverable by and paid to the Commission for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a general railroad contingent fund as hereinafter described. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 481]\n\u00a0\n For the purposes of this paragraph the value of the railroad property and the net railway operating income of a group of carriers, which the Commission finds are under common control and management and are operated as a single system, shall be computed for the system as a whole irrespective of the separate ownership and accounting returns of the various parts of such system. In the case of any carrier which has accepted the provisions of section 209 of this amendatory Act the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to the income for any period prior to September 1, 1920. The value of such railway property shall be determined by the Commission in the manner provided in paragraph (4).'\n\n After an investigation instituted under section 15a, May 14, 1924, for the purpose of determining incomes received by St. Louis & O'Fallon Railway Company (the O'Fallon) and Manufacturers' Railway Company (the Manufacturers'), asserted to be parts of one system, for the years 1920- 1923, the Commission found: (1) Although the stock of both corporations was mostly owned by the Adolph Busch estate, and their principal officers were the same, they were not carriers operated under common control and management as a single system within paragraph 6. (2) The Manufacturers' had received no excess operating income: (3) The value of the O'Fallon's property devoted to public service in 1920 (ten months) was $856,065; in 1921, $875,360; in 1922, $978,874; in 1923, $997,236; and during each of those years it received net operative income exceeding 6 per cent. upon the stated valuation.\n The above-described recapture order followed.\n The cause is properly here under the Judicial Code, as amended by Act of February 13, 1925 (U. S. C. tit, 28,  345 (28 USCA  345)):\n'Sec. 238. A direct review by the Supreme Court of an interlocutory or final judgment or decree of a district \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 482]\n\u00a0\n court may be had where it is so provided in the following Acts or parts of Acts, and not otherwise: ...\n\n'(4) So much of 'An Act making appropriations to supply urgent deficiencies in appropriations for the fiscal year 1913, and for other purposes,' approved October 22, 1913, as relates to review of interlocutory and final judgments and decrees in suits to enforce, suspend, or set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission other than for the payment of money. ...'\n\n The Act of October 22, 1913 (38 Stat. 219, 220), transferred to District Courts the jurisdiction granted to the Commerce Court by Act of June 18, 1920 (36 Stat. 539), and provided for review by this court of causes embraced therein. The jurisdiction for the Commerce Court included:\n'First. All cases for the enforcement, otherwise than by adjudication and collection of a forfeiture or penalty or by infliction of criminal punishment, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission other than for the payment of money.\n\n'Second. Cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. ... '\n\n Paragraph (4),  238, applies to all those causes formerly cognizable by the Commerce Court and reviewable here. The words 'other than for the payment of money' were taken from clause first, Act of 1910, above quoted, and, as there, they delimit the trial court's jurisdiction. They do not inhibit review here of any cause formerly cognizable by the Commerce Court. Moreover, the order under consideration was not merely for payment of money; and the proceeding below was to set aside, not to enforce it.\n Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086, and Dayton- Goose \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 483]\n\u00a0\n Creek Railway Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472, point out the general purpose of the Transportation Act 1920, and uphold the validity of section 15a.\n The Manufacturers' is a switching road with 30 miles of track within St. Louis, Mo. The O'Fallon-a coal-carrying road-has 9 miles of main line, all in Illinois, and this connects with the Terminal Railroad at East St. Louis. Through the latter deliveries are made to sundry points in St. Louis, some of which are on the Manufacturers' line. 'The distance between the railroad of the O'Fallon and the railroad of the Manufacturers' is about 12 miles, and all communication by rail between the two properties is effected over the tracks of the Terminal, including a bridge over the Mississippi River.' Both the Commission and the District Court held that the record failed to show these two roads were under common control and management and operated as a single system within the meaning of paragraph 6. We accept their conclusion.\n The Commission directed the O'Fallon to pay 6 per cent. interest on the recaptured one-half of its ascertained excess net railway operating income beginning four months from the end of the year during which the excess accrued (paragraph 6). The District Court rightly ruled that, as the carrier made bona fide denial of any excess under circumstances sufficient to justify a contest, no interest should have been imposed for any time prior to the final order. Not until then could the carrier know what, if anything, it should pay.\n Also, we think the District Court rightly rejected the claim that excess earnings were not recapturable unless and until the Commission had fixed a general level of rates intended to yield fair return upon the aggregate value of carrier property either as a whole, or in some prescribed rate or territorial group. Congress, of course, \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 484]\n\u00a0\n realized that final valuations would require prodigious expenditure of time and effort; but the language concerning recapture indicates that prompt action was expected. Practical application of paragraphs 5 and 6 does not necessarily depend upon prior compliance with paragraphs 2 and 3. The act should be construed so as to carry out the legislative purpose. The proviso of paragraph 3 prescribing action to be taken during two years beginning March 1, 1920, and the clause of paragraph 6 excepting the income of certain roads prior to September 1, 1920, are hardly compatible with this claim by the carrier.\n Paragraph 4,  15a, directs that, in determining values of railway property for purposes of recapture, the Commission 'shall give due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate-making purposes, and shall give to the property investment account of the carriers only that consideration which under such law it is entitled to in establishing values for rate-making purposes.' This is an express command; and the carrier has clear right to demand compliance therewith. United States ex rel. Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v.

Ct. 434)): 'We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a cor- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 485]\n\u00a0\n poration maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the rrobable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.'\n In Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission (page 287 of 262 U. S. (43 S. Ct. 546)) we said: 'It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, ect., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for tomorrow cannot ignore prices of today.'\n The doctrine above stated has been consistently adhered to by this court.\n The report of the Commission is long and argumentative. Much of it is devoted to general observations relative to the method and purpose of making valuations; many objections are urged to doctrine approved by us; and the superiority of another view is stoutly asserted. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 486]\n\u00a0\n It carefully refrains from stating that any consideration whatever was given to present or reproduction costs in estimating the value of the carrier's property. Four dissenting Commissioners declare that reproduction costs were not considered; and the report itself confirms their view. Two of the majority avow a like understanding of the course pursued.\n The following from the dissenting opinion of Commissioner Hall, concurred in by three others, accurately describes the action of the Commission:\n'In order to determine the value of the O'Fallon property devoted to carrier service during the recapture periods, 10 months in the year 1920 and the years 1921, 1922, and 1923, we start with a valuation or inventory date of June 30, 1919. The units in existence on that date are known. Original cost of the entire property cannot be ascertained. As to the man-made units we estimate the cost of reproducing them in their condition on that date and in so doing apply to the units installed prior to June 30, 1914, the unit prices of 1914, representing a fairly consistent price level for the preceding 5 or 10 years. To like units, installed after June 30, 1914, and prior to June 30, 1919, we apply the same prices, but add a sum representing price increases on those units during that period. For the third period, from June 30, 1919, down to each recapture date, we abandon estimate and turn to recorded net cost of additions less retirements. On this composite, made up of estimated value for two periods and ascertained net cost for the third period, the majority base a conclusion as to value at recapture date of the man-made items. Land goes in at its current value as measured by that of neighboring lands.\n\n'Without summarizing the other processes, all clearly stated in the majority report, it will be observed that the rate-making value arrived at for the successive recapture periods, as for example the year 1923, rests upon 1923 \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 487]\n\u00a0\n market value of lands; costs of other property installed since June 30, 1919; unit prices of 1914, enhanced by allowance for increased cost of units installed during June 30, 1914-1919; and, for the units installed prior to June 30, 1914, constituting by far the major part of the property, unit prices of 1914 without any enhancement whatever. As to this major part of the carrier's property devoted to carrier purposes in 1923 no consideration is given to costs and prices then obtaining or to increase therein since 1914.'\n\n In the exercise of its proper function, this court has declared the law of the land concerning valuations for rate-making purposes. The commission disregarded the approved rule and has thereby failed to discharge the definite duty imposed by Congress. Unfortunately, proper heed was denied the timely admonition of the minority-'The function in this commission is not to act as an arbiter in economics, but as an agency of Congress, to apply the law of the land to facts developed of record in matters committed by Congress to our jurisdiction.'\n The question on which the Commission divided is this: When seeking to ascertain the value of railroad property for recapture purposes, must it give consideration to current, or reproduction, costs? The weight to be accorded thereto is not the matter before us. No doubt there are some, perhaps many, railroads the ultimate value of which should be placed far below the sum necessary for reproduction. But Congress has directed that values shall be fixed upon a consideration of present costs along with all other pertinent facts; and this mandate must be obeyed.\n It was deemed unnecessary by the court below to determine whether the Commission obeyed the statutory direction touching valuations since the order permitted the O'Fallon to retain an income great enough to negative any suggestion of actual confiscation. With this we \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 488]\n\u00a0\n cannot agree. Whether the Commission acted as directed by Congress was the fundamental question presented. If it did not, the action taken, being beyond the authority granted, was invalid. The only power to make any recapture order arose from the statute.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed. A decree will be entered here annulling the challenged order.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or determination of this cause.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n The main question for consideration is that of statutory construction. By Transportation Act 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91,  15a, 41 Stat. 456, 488 (49 USCA  15a), Congress delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission the duty to establish and maintain rates which will yield 'a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property' of the United States. By paragraph 4 thereof, it directs that in ascertaining value the Commission shall 'give due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate-making purposes,' and shall 'give to the property investment account ... only that consideration which under such law it is entitled to in establishing values for rate-making purposes.' The report of the Commission, which accompanies the order challenged, declares: 'In the methods of valuation which we have followed in this proceeding we have endeavored to give heed to this direction (that contained in paragraph 4). ...' Excess Income of St. Louis & O'Fallon Ry. Co., 124 I. C. C. 3, 19. Speaking for the dissenting members, Mr. Commissioner Hall said: 'If the law needs change, let those who made it change it. Our duty is to \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 489]\n\u00a0\n apply the law as it stands.' Pages 63, 64. And Mr. Commissioner Aitchison added: 'If we anticipate grave results will follow, our responsibility will be fully met if we suggest to the Congress, under our statutory powers to recommend new legislation to that body, the enactment of a rule for rate making under the commerce clause which will have no such unfavorable effects.' Page 64.\n Section 15a makes no specific reference either to the original cost of the property, or to prudent investment, or to current reproduction cost, or to the then existing price level. Section 19a (49 USCA  19a)-the valuation provisions of the Act of 1913-to which section 15a refers, directs the Commission to report, among other things, 'in detail as to each piece of property, ... the original cost to date, the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation'; and also 'other values, and elements of value.' After the enactment of section 15a and before entry of the order challenged, it was held in Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, a case arising under a state law, that the rate base on which a public utility is constitutionally entitled to earn a fair return is the then actual value of the property used and useful in the business, not the original cost or the amount prudently invested in the enterprise. The government concedes that current reproduction cost is admissible as evidence to show present value under section 15a. The carrier concedes now that neither Congress nor the common law made current reproduction cost the measure of value. The question on which the Commission divided is this: Did Congress require the Commission, when acting under section 15a, to give, in all cases and in respect to all property, some, if not controlling, effect to evidence establishing the estimated current cost of reproduction? Or did Congress intend to leave to the Commission the authority to determine, as in passing upon other con- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 490]\n\u00a0\n trovered issued of fact, what weight, if any, it should give to that evidence?\n The O'Fallon contends, among other things, that the order is confiscatory. The claim is that the order left to the company a return of only 4.35 per cent. upon the value ascertained in accordance with the rule declared in the Southwestern Bell Case and McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400\n, 47 S. Ct. 144. If this were true, it would be immaterial whether Congress purported to authorize the course pursued by the Commission. But the fact is that in each of the recapture periods the earnings were so large as to leave, after making the required payments to the Commission, about 8 per cent. on what the carrier alleged was the fair value of the property. The O'Fallon argues that, since the statute, and the order required it to hold as a reserve one-half of the excess over 6 per cent., it is deprived of that property. This is not true. The requirement that one-half of the earnings in excess of 6 per cent. shall be retained by the carrier until the reserve equals 5 per cent. of the value of the railroad does not deprive the carrier of any property. It merely regulates the use thereof. Compare Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 453\n, 34 S. Ct. 125, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1. The provision is one designed to secure financial stability, and is similar to those prescribing sinking funds, depreciation, and other appropriate accounts. \n1\n Congress may regulate the use of railroad property so as to insure financial as well as physical stability. Both are essential to the safety and the service of the public. In Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 491]\n\u00a0\n States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 486\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472, where the facts were in this respect identical with those in the case at bar, the constitutional validity of the order was sustained. If the failure to give to the evidence of current reproduction costs the effect claimed for it by the O'Fallon was error, it is not because the carrier's constitutional rights have been invaded, but because the Commission failed to observe a rule prescribed by Congress for determining the amounts to be recaptured and reserved.\n The claim of the O'Fallon is in substance that, since construction costs were higher during the recapture periods than in 1914, the order should be set aside, because the Commission failed to find that the existing structural property and equipment which had been acquired before June 30, 1914, was worth more than it had been then. \n2\n The Commission undertook, as will be shown, to find present actual value, and, in so doing, both to follow the direction of Congress and to apply the rule declared in the Southwestern Bell Case. It is true that this court there declared that current reconstruction cost is an element of actual value, and that Congress directed the Commission 'to give due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate- making purposes.' But while the act required the Commission to consider all such evidence, neither Congress nor this court required it to give to evidence of reconstruction cost a mechanical effect or artificial weight. They left untrammeled its duty to give to all relevant evidence such probative force as, in its judgment, the evidence inherently possesses. The Commission concluded that in respect to the evidence of reproduction costs the differences between the Southwestern Bell Case and that at bar were \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 492]\n\u00a0\n such as to lead to different results in the two cases. It did so mainly because 'in the administration of the valuation and recapture provisions,' ascertainment of value 'is affected by a vast variety of considerations that either do not enter into, or are less easily perceived in, problems incident to the regulation of local public utilities.' Page 27. In my opinion the conclusions of the Commission are well founded. To make clear the reasons, requires consideration of the function of the Commission in applying section 15a and of the problems with which it is confronted.\n First. The Commission is a fact-finding body. The question whether it must give to confessedly relevant facts evidential effect is solely one of adjective law. Statutes have sometimes limited the weight or effect of evidence. They have often created rebuttable presumptions and have shifted the burden of proof. But no instance has been found where under our law a fact-finding body has been required to give to evidence an effect which it does not inherently possess. Proof implies persuasion. To compel the human mind to infer in any respect that which observation and logic tells us is not true interferes with the process of reasoning of the fact-finding body. It would be a departure from the unbroken practice to require an artificial legal conviction where no real conviction exists. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n An arbitrary disregard by the Commission of the probative effect of evidence would, of course, be ground for setting aside an order, as this would be an abuse of discretion. Orders have been set aside because entered without evidence;4 or because matters of fact had been considered \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 493]\n\u00a0\n which were not in the record;5 or because the Commission excluded from consideration facts and circumstances which ought to have been considered; 6 or because it took into consideration facts which could not legally influence its judgment. \n7\n But no case has been found in which this court has set aside an order on the ground that the Commission failed to give effect to evidence which seemed to the court to be of probative force, or on the ground that the Commission had drawn from the evidence an inference or conclusion deemed by the court to be erroneous. \n8\n On \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 494]\n\u00a0\n the contrary, findings of the Commission involving the appeciation or effect of evidence have been treated with the deference due to those of a tribunal 'informed by experience' and 'appointed by law' to deal with an intricate subject. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700. Unless, therefore, Congress required the Commission, not only to consider evidence of reconstruction cost in ascertaining values for rate-making purposes under section 15a, but also to give, in all cases and in respect to all property, some weight to evidence of enhanced reconstruction cost, even if that evidence was not inherently persuasive, the Commission was clearly authorized to determine for itself to what extent, if any, weight should be given to the evidence; and its findings should not be disturbed by the court, unless it appears that there was an abuse of discretion.\n Second. While current reproduction cost may be said to be an element in the present value of property, in the sense that it is 'evidence properly to be considered in the ascertainment of value,' Standard Oil Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 45 S. Ct. 465, 467 (69 L. Ed. 890), it is clear that current cost of reproduction higher than the original cost does not necessarily tend to prove a present higher value. Often the fact of higher reconstruction cost is without any influence on present values. It is common knowledge that the current market value of many office buildings and residences constructed prior to the World War have failed to reflect the greatly increased building costs of recent years, although the need of new buildings of like character was being demonstrated by the large volume of con- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 495]\n\u00a0\n struction at the higher price level. Many railroads built before the World War have never been worth as much as their original cost, because high construction cost combined with adverse operating conditions and limited traffic have at all times prevented their earning, despite reasonable rates, a fair return on the original cost. The Puget Sound extension of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul is a notable example. \n9\n Many branches, and indeed whole lines of railroad, have been scrapped since 1920. Abandonment of 2,439 miles of railroad was authorized under paragraph 18 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  1(18), between 1920 and 1925, and in the three fol- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 496]\n\u00a0\n lowing years 2,010 miles more. \n10\n These properties had, in the main, become valueless for transportation, either because traffic ceased to be available, or because competitive means of transportation precluded the establishment of remunerative rail rates. \n11\n Obviously, no one would contend that their actual value just before abandonment was what it originally cost to construct them or what it would then have cost to reconstruct them.\n Third. The terms of section 15a and its legislative history preclude the assumption that Congress intended by paragraph 4 to deny to the Commission in respect to evidence of reconstruction cost the discretion commonly exercised in determining what weight, if any, shall be given to an evidential fact. In 1920, no fact was more prominent in the mind of the public and of Congress than that the cost of living was far greater than that prevailing when the existing railroads were built. \n12\n But neither in Transportation Act 1920, nor in any committee report, is there even a suggestion that the Commission would be required \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 497]\n\u00a0\n to give to that fact any effect in ascertaining values for rate-making purposes under section 15a. If it had been the intention of Congress to compel the Commission to increase values for rate-making purposes because the price level had risen, it would naturally have incorporated such a direction in the paragraph. On the other hand, the committee reports and the debates show that the opinion was quite commonly held that the actual values were less than the property investment account appearing on the books of the carriers;13 and the proposal made by the railroads that the investment account be accepted as the measure of value was resisted as being excessive. \n14\n The property \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 498]\n\u00a0\n investment account in 1920 was about 19 billions of dollars. \n15\n The then reproduction cost of the railroads, applying index figures to estimated actual cost, was over 40 billions. \n16\n It is inconceivable that Congress, after rejecting property investment account as excessive, intended by section 15a to make mandatory on the Commission the consideration of elements which would give a valuation double that which had been rejected. The insertion in section 15a of the provision that the Commission 'shall give to the property investment account of the carriers only that consideration which under such law it is entitled to in establishing values for rate-making purposes,' and the rejection of other proposed measures of value, show that Congress intended not to impose restrictions upon the discretion of the Commission. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Congress did intend to provide a return on the existing railroad property which should be only slightly more than that which had been enjoyed during the six preceding years. To have required that the then price level be reflected in the values to be fixed under section 15a would have resulted in a rate base of double the property investment account of the carriers; for the cost of living was then about double prewar prices. The prescribed fair return \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 499]\n\u00a0\n applied to such a rate base would have produced more than double the average net earnings from operation of the several properties during the three years preceding federal control; more than double and amount which the carriers agreed to accept under the Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25,  1, 40 Stat. 451, as fair compensation for the use of their property; more than double the guaranty provided by Transportation Act 1920,  209 (49 USCA  77), for the six-month period after the surrender of control. The sum which the railroads had thus earned net in those six years equalled 5.2 per cent. on the property investment account, as carried on their books.\n In making provision for a fair return, the main purpose was not to increase the earnings of capital already invested in railroads, but to attract the new capital needed for improvement or extension of facilities. 18 This was to be accomplished by raising the rate or return from 5.2 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. (Senate Reports, vol. 1, No. 304, 66th Cong. 1st Sess.):\n'The basis adopted by the Committee is three tenths of 1 per cent. higher than the basis of the test period (the three years preceding June 30, 1917); and assuming, though not conceding that the value of the property is equal to the property investment accounts, it will yield for all the railways a net operating income of $54,000,000 in excess of the income of the test period. There were two considerations which led the majority of the committee \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 500]\n\u00a0\n to believe that this increase is not only warranted but necessary:\n\n'First. The railways are being returned to their owners when everything is unsettled and abnormal; when there is suspicion and distrust everywhere. Just what rate of return will enable the carriers to finance themselves under such conditions cannot, with certainty be determined. It was felt, therefore, that some increase over the prewar period was justifiable.\n\n'Second. As compared with all kinds of commodities, money is must less valuable than it was a few years ago, and it would seem to be only fair that the returns from railway investments should be reasonably advanced.'\n\n The means by which the bill was to accomplish the desired end are thus stated in the report:\n'First: By prescribing a basis of return upon the value of the railway property, to give such assurance to investors as will incline them to look with favor upon railway securities; that is to say, be making a moderate return reasonably certain to establish credit for the carriers.\n\n'Second: In making the return fairly certain to secure for the public a lower capital charge than would otherwise be necessary.\n\n'Third: In requiring some carriers, which under any given body of rates will earn more than a fair return, to pay the excess to the Government and in so using this excess that transportation facilities or credit can be furnished to the weaker carriers, and thus help to maintain the general system of transportation.'\n\n Either increase in the rate of return or increase of the base on which that return is measured would have served to adjust compensation to higher price levels. The adoption by Congress of the increase in the return, as the means of compensating for the decreased purchasing power of the dollar, precludes the assumption that it intended that the valuation should reflect that lessened pur- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 501]\n\u00a0\n chasing power. By explicitly choosing the former Congress implicitly rejected the latter. \n19\n For to have allowed an increase in both would have gone beyond adjusting earnings to increased costs and have made this increase a mere pretext for allowing unwarranted profits to the railroads. The proceedings which led to the passage of the act make it clear that Congress intended no such result.\n Fourth. The declared purpose of Congress in enacting section 15a was the maintenance of an adequate national system of railway transportation, capable of providing the best possible service to the public at the lowest cost consistent with full justice to the private owners. Following the course consistently pursued by this court in applying other provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 211\n, 219 S., 16 S. Ct. 666; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 190 S., 43 S. Ct. 270; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472, the Commission construed section 15a in the light of the declared purpose of Congress and of the economic factors involved. From its wide knowledge of actual conditions and its practical experience in rate making, it concluded that to give effect to enhanced reproduction costs would defeat that purpose. Page 27.\n It knew that the value for rate-making purposes could not be more than that sum on which a fair return could be earned by legal rates, and that the earnings were \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 502]\n\u00a0\n limited both by the commercial prohibition of rates higher than the traffic would bear and the legal prohibition of rates higher than are just and reasonable. It knew that a ratebase fluctuating with changes in the level of general prices would imperil industry and commerce. It knew that the adoption of a fluctuating rate-base would not, as is claimed, do justice to those prewar investors in railroad securities who were suffering from the lessened value of the dollar, since the great majority of the railroad securities are represented by long-term bonds or the guaranteed stocks of leased lines which bear a fixed return, and that only the stockholders could gain through the greater earnings required to satisfy the higher rate base. It recognized that an adequate national system of railways, so long as it is privately owned, cannot be provided and maintained without a continuous inflow of capital; that, 'obviously, also, such an inflow of capital can only be assured by treatment of capital already invested which will invite and encourage further investment' (Page 30); and that, as was said in Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 481\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 173 (68 L. Ed. 388, 33 A. L. R. 472): 'By investment in a business dedicated to the public service the owner must recognize that, as compared with investment in private business, he cannot expect either high or speculative dividends but that his obligation limits him to only fair or reasonable profit.' \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 461, 503]\n\u00a0\n The conviction that there would in time be a fall in the price level was generally held. As a fluctuating rate base would thus directly imperil industry and commerce and investments made at relatively high price levels during and since the World War,21 would tend to increase the cost of new money required to supply adequate service to the public, and would discourage such investment, the Commission concluded that Congress could and have intended to require it to measure the value or rate base by reproduction cost, since this would produce a result contrary to its declared purpose. And, as confirming its construction of section 15a, the Commission showed that, with the stable rate base which it had accepted as the basis for administering the act, the aim of Congress to establish an adequate national system had been attained. It pointed out that: 'During the period 1920-1926, inclusive, the investment in railroad property increased by 4 billions of dollars. A substantial part of this money was derived from income, but much of it was obtained by the sale of new securities. The market for railroad securities since the passage of the transportation act, 1920, has steadily improved and the general trend of interest rates has been downward. The credit of the railroads in general is now excellent. ...' Page 33.\n Fifth. Other considerations confirm the construction given by the Commission to the phrase 'value for rate making purposes,' as used in section 15a. In condemnation proceedings, the owner recovers what he has lost by the \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 504]\n\u00a0\n taking of the property, Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, \n217 \nU.S. 189, 195\n, 30 S. Ct. 459, and such loss must be determined, 'not merely with reference to the uses to which it is at the time applied, but with reference to the uses to which it is plainly adapted.' Mississippi & R. Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 408 (25 L. Ed. 206). Compare Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 435\n, 25 S. Ct. 466. But the actual value of a railroad- its value for rate-making purposes under section 15a-may be less than its condemnation value. As was said in Southern Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, \n274 \nU.S. 76, 81\n, 82 S., 47 S. Ct. 542, 544 (71 L. Ed. 934) a case involving state taxation: 'The value of the physical elements of a railroad-whether that value be deemed actual cost, cost of reproduction new, cost of reproduction less depreciation or some other figure-is not the sole measure of or guide to its value in operation. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 547 (18 S. Ct. 418). Much weight is to be given to present and prospective earning capacity at rates that are reasonable, having regard to traffic available and competitive and other conditions prevailing in the territory served.'\n Value has been defined as the ability to command the price. \n22\n Railroad property is valuable as such only if, and so far as, used. If rates are too high, the traffic will not move. Hence the value or rate base is necessarily dependent, in the first place, upon the commercial ability of the property to command the rates which will yield a return in excess of operating expenses and taxes; and such value cannot be higher than the sum on which, with the \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 505]\n\u00a0\n available traffic, the fair return fixed under section 15a can be earned. Persistent depression of rates or lessening volume of traffic, from whatever cause arising, ordinarily tends to lower actual values of railroad properties. It follows that, since the Commission is required by the rule of Smyth v. Ames, reaffirmed in the Southwestern Bell Case, to determine the rate base under section 15a by actual value as distinguished from prudent investment, it must, in making the finding, consider the effect upon value of both the commercial and the legal limitations upon rates, and, among other things, the effect of competition upon the volume of traffic.\n Recent experience affords striking examples of commercial limitations upon rates. In Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220, the Commission sought to establish rates which would yield 6 per cent. upon the aggregate values of the railroads in the several groups. The carriers claimed as the aggregate value $20,040,572,611-that amount being carried on their books as the cost of road and equipment. The Commission fixed the value about 5 per cent. lower-at $18,900,000,000. In order to produce on that sum net earnings equal to 6 per cent., it increased freight rates, in the eastern group, 40 per cent. over the then existing rates; in the southern group, 25 per cent.; in the western group 35 per cent.; and, in the mountain-Pacific group, 25 per cent. 23 As a result of these increases, the average gross revenue per ton mile in 1921 was in the eastern district 96.1 per cent. greater than for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1914; in the southern, 61.4; in the western, 59.3; and in the United States as a whole, 76.2. Reduced Rates, 1922, 68, I. C. C. 676, 702. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 506]\n\u00a0\n Passenger rates were subjected by the order in Ex parte 74, to a flat increase of 20 per cent., and surcharges were added. Page 242 of 58 I. C. C. \n 24\n\u00a0\n\n On a large number of basic commodities, which were among the most important articles of commerce, the rates proved to be higher than the traffic would bear. Reductions became imperative. Within a year after the entry of that order, many applications for reductions were made to the Commission, not only by shippers, but also by the carriers themselves. It was estimated that the reductions in freight rates made by the carriers prior to March 15, 1922, would aggregate for that year $186,700,000, and would lower the general rate level nearly 5 per cent. On some important articles of traffic the entire increase made by Ex parte 74 was canceled. 25 Further reductions were then ordered by Reduced Rates 1922, 68 I. C. C. 676, pages 732, 733, the Commission saying: 'High rates do not necessarily mean high revenues, for, if the public cannot or will not ship in normal volume, less revenue may result than from lower rates. Shippers almost unanimously contend, and many representatives of the carriers agree, that 'freight rates are too high and must come down.' \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 507]\n\u00a0\n This indicates that transportation charges have mounted to a point where they are impeding the free flow of commerce and thus tending to defeat the purpose for which they were established, that of producing revenues which would enable the carriers 'to provide the people of the United States with adequate transportation.\" Further reductions made in the year 1923 are said to have again lowered freight rates 5 per cent. \n26\n The effect of the several reductions made in the rates authorized by Ex parte 74 is said to have lowered by $800,000,000 the freight charges otherwise payable on the traffic carried during the eighteen months ending December 31, 1923.27 Each year since has witnessed a further lowering in the revenue per ton mile and per passenger mile. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n This constant lowering of the weighted average of rates since 1920 must have been due to causes other than desire on the part of the Commission. Its aim was to adjust rates so that they would yield the prescribed return. But, for the period from 1920 to 1927, inclusive, there was only one year in which the railroads of the United States as a whole, despite general prosperity and greater efficiency, earned on the value found in Ex parte 74 brought down to date, the full average return prescribed as fair under \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 508]\n\u00a0\n section 15a. \n29\n The Commission repeatedly refused to permit carriers to make reductions, because the reduction would lower the revenues sought to be provided under section 15a 30 On the other hand, carriers, although earning less than the fair return prescribed under section 15a, have often voluntarily reduced rates. \n31\n The lowering of rates was probably due \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 509]\n\u00a0\n in large measure to the influence of competing means of transportation. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n Sixth. Since 1914, the railroads have been obliged, to an ever- increasing extent, to compete with water lines and with motors. This competition has been fostered by the government33 through the Panama Canal Act,34 through \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 510]\n\u00a0\n the intracoastal waterways acts,35 through the inland waterways acts,36 through the development of coastwise \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 511]\n\u00a0\n shipping by means of harbor improvements, 37 and through federal aid in the construction of highway. \n38\n There has also been increased competition by pipe lines. Competition from other means of transportation has tended to arrest the normal increase in the volume of rail traffic; and, as to some traffic, it has actually produced a reduction in both the volume and the rates. It has resulted in a general shrinkage in the passenger business,39 in some regions, in a lessening of the carload freight;40 and, in \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 512]\n\u00a0\n many, in a reduction of the volume of the less than carload freight. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n The influence of water competition on rates is strikingly illustrated by the effect of the Panama Canal on transcontinental freight rates. \n42\n In order to meet this water competition, carriers have repeatedly asked leave to make sweeping reductions. \n43\n Rates voluntarily established by the rail carriers are lower now, on some articles of traffic, than they were in 1914. On others they are only a little higher. \n44\n The influence of competition by \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 513]\n\u00a0\n the inland waterways on the volume of rail traffic is illustrated in the effect which improvement of the Ohio river and its tributaries has had in the Pittsburg district. The rail tonnage in 1927 was materially less than in 1914, while the water tonnage more than doubled. \n45\n The influence of barge lines in reducing or holding down rail rates is illustrated by the rail rates in competition with those of the barge lines on the Ohio, the Mississippi, and \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 514]\n\u00a0\n the Warrior rivers. \n46\n The widespread effect of competition by motortruck in lowering both the rates and volume of rail traffic is obvious. \n47\n Not obvious, but indisputable, has been the effect of the potential competition of pipe \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 515]\n\u00a0\n lines shown by reductions in oil rates caused by the threat of competing pipe lines. \n48\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover, rates which are not so high as to prevent commercially the movement of traffic are often required to be lowered because they conflict with some statutory provision. Thus Congress compels reduction of rates which discriminate unjustly against individuals, localities, articles of traffic, or other carriers. Perhaps the most striking instance of the limitation by law of rates which the traffic would bear commercially is furnished by cases under the long and short haul clause. By that clause, a rail carrier is often obliged (unless relieved by order of the Commission) to elect between suffering practically a total loss of existing traffic between competitive points or suffering a loss in existing revenues by reducing rates at both the competitive points and intermediate noncompetitive points. The effect of this limitation upon rates, and hence upon the actual value of railroads, has become very great. Its influence has grown steadily with the growth \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 516]\n\u00a0\n of competition by water and motor, with the growth in the size of the individual railroad system, with the growth in the dependence of railroads for their revenues upon long-haul freight traffic and with the growing length of the average haul. \n49\n It has become so important for rail carriers to hold a share of the long-haul freight traffic at competitive points, that the long and short haul clause, if not relieved from, results in the carriers' giving, in large measure, to the intermediate noncompetitive points which otherwise would be subject to monopoly exactions, the full benefit of that lowering of rates required to meet the competition. The many applications for reductions made in petitions for relief from the operation of the long and short haul clause illustrate the influence of rail, as well as of water and motor, competition in thus depressing rates. 50 Congress has by that clause limited values for rate-making purposes under section 15a, almost as effectively as by its promotion of competitive means of transportation.\n Seventh. In requiring that the value be ascertained for rate-making purposes, Congress imposed upon the rate base as defined in Smyth v. Ames, still another limitation which is far-reaching in its operation. By declaring in section 15a that the Commission shall, 'in the exercise of its \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 517]\n\u00a0\n power to prescribe just and reasonable rates' so adjust them that upon the value a fair return may be earned 'under honest, efficient and economical management' Congress made efficiency of the plant an element or test of value. \n51\n Efficiency and economy imply employment of the right instrument and material as well as their use in the right manner. To use a machine, after a much better and more economical one has become available, is as inefficient as to use two men to operate an efficient machine, when the work could be performed equally well by one, at half the labor cost. Such an instrument of transportation, although originally well conceived and remunerative, should, like machines used in manufacturing, be scrapped when it becomes wasteful.\n Independently of any statute, it is now recognized that, when in confiscation cases it is sought to prove actual value by evidence of reproduction cost, the evidence must be directed to the present cost of installing such a plant as would be required to supply the same service. For valuation of public utilities by reproduction cost implies that 'the rates permitted should be high enough to allow a reasonable per cent. of return on the money that would now be required to construct a plant capable of rendering the desired service,' and does not mean 'that the plant should be valued at what would now be needed to \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 518]\n\u00a0\n duplicate the plant precisely.' \n52\n Proof of value by evidence of reproduction cost presupposes that a plant like that being valued would then be constructed. To the extent that a railroad employs instruments which are inconsistent with efficiency, the plant would not be constructed; and, because of the inefficient part, the railroad is obviously not then worth the cost of reconstructing the identical plant. While a part often has some service value, although not efficient according to the existing standard, its use may involve such heavy, unnecessary operating expense as to render it valueless for rate making purposes under section 15a. The Commission, when requested to consider evidence of reproduction cost, must therefore examine the value of every part of the plant, and that of the whole plant, as compared with the value of a modern, efficient plant. Upon such consideration the Commission may conclude that the railroad is so largely obsolete in construction and equipment as to render evidence of the reproduction cost of the identical plant of no probative force whatsoever. The duty so to deal with the evidence seems to flow necessarily from the rejection by the court of prudent investment as the measure of value, and the adoption, instead, of the actual value of the property at the time of the rate hearing as the governing rule of substantive law. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 519]\n\u00a0\n The physical deterioration of a railroad plant through wear and tear may be very small as compared with a plant new, while its functional deterioration may be very large as compared with a modern efficient plant. This lessening of service value may be due to any one of several causes. It may, in the first place, be due to causes wholly external. Freight terminals, originally well conceived and wisely located in the heart of a city, may have become valueless for rate-making purposes under section 15a, because through growth of the city the expense of operating therein has become so high, or the inescapable cost of eliminating grade crossings so large, that efficient management requires immediate abandonment of the terminals. \n53\n And, even if the cost of continuing operation there is not so high as to require abandonment, the property may have for rate-making purposes a value far below its market value. 54 Compare Minneapolis & St. Louis \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 520]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n186 \nU.S. 257, 268\n, 22 S. Ct. 900 (46 L. Ed. 1151); Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 52\n, 29 S. Ct. 192 (53 L. Ed. 382, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034).\n The lessening of the service value of a part of the railroad plant may flow from changes in the volume or character of its traffic. For economy and efficiency are obviously to be determined with reference to the business of the carrier then being done and about to be done. \n55\n A station warehouse for less-than-carload freight may have become valueless for rate-making purposes, because, through motor competition, the railroad had lost substantially all its less-than-carload business at that point. Large reductions in the value of passenger stations and equipment may have resulted from decline in the passenger traffic. Branch lines may lose all their service value so that they should be abandoned because motor transportation has become more efficient. On the other hand, the traffic may have grown so much as to render inefficient a part of a \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 521]\n\u00a0\n line originally wisely constructed with heavy grades56 or curves. 57 In that event economy and efficiency will demand elimination of the grades and curves and may even \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 522]\n\u00a0\n require the building of tunnels or a cut-off. 58 In so far as such a condition exists, the railroad would obviously not be reconstructed with the heavy grades and curves;59 and, when considering the reconstruction cost of the whole \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 523]\n\u00a0\n property, that part of the line must be given merely scrap value. Compare Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423\n, 34 S. Ct. 125, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1,\n Perhaps the most common cause of the lessening of service value of parts of railroad plants originally well conceived and still in good physical condition is the progress in the art of rail transportation. Science and invention have wrought since June 30, 1914, such extraordinary improvements in the types of automobiles and aeroplanes that no one would contend that the present service value of such machines should be ascertained by inquiring what their original cost was or what their reproduction cost would be. The progress since June 30, 1914, in the art of transportation by railroad has been less spectacular; but the art has been far from stagnant. \n60\n In railroading, as in other \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 524]\n\u00a0\n fields of business, the great rise in the cost of labor and of supplies, and the need of better service, have stimulated, not only inventions, but also their utilization. Through technological advances, instruments of transportation with largely increased efficiency and economy have been developed. The price of lower operating costs is the scrapping of those parts of the plant which progress in the art render obsolete. \n61\n The present greatly increased efficiency of the railroads as compared with 1920, their greatly improved credit, and their present prosperity, are, in large measure, due to the advances made toward introducing the improved instruments of rail transportation which have become available. \n62\n Obviously much remains to be done. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 525]\n\u00a0\n The extent of this technological progress may be illustrated by the modern locomotive. The development of the superheater, the mechanical stoker, the booster, and other devises, the increase in the size of the boiler, and other radical changes in size, weight, and design have resulted in the production of engines which are recognized by railway experts as having set such an entirely new standard of efficiency in fuel consumption,63 in tractive power,64 and in speed65 as to render wasteful, under many condi- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 526]\n\u00a0\n tions, the use of older locomotives, no matter how good their condition. Statistics as to actual performances of the locomotive of to-day, as compared with that built but a few days ago, graphically illustrate this great advance in efficiency. \n66\n\u00a0\n\n Its economies are compelling. But important changes in roadway and equipment are conditions of its effective use. Heavier locomotives make greater demands on the road structure which carry them. To obviate large maintenance expenses attendant upon frequent repair and replacement the roadway must be made more durable. \n67\n To \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 527]\n\u00a0\n this end rails of heavier section,68 and of increased length are adopted. 69 Anti-creepers are freely used to prevent rail movement. \n70\n Larger ties are selected; and they are treated to prevent deterioration. \n71\n Ballast is made deeper and heavier, and of gravel or stone rather than of cinders. \n72\n Bridges are of stronger construction. 73 And, to \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 528]\n\u00a0\n facilitate the movement of traffic, watering stations74 and automatic signals75 of improved design are introduced. Moreover, the effective employment of the modern locomotive involves ordinarily the use of larger cars of steel construction, displacing the wooden car of small capacity with which so many of the railroads were equipped in 1914.76 Engine terminals and carshops built prior to 1914 are, in many cases, inadequate 77 for the efficient and \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 529]\n\u00a0\n economical handling, housing, and repairing of the modern locomotives and cars, and must be replaced to prevent curtailment of the productive capacity of the rolling stock by needless idle hours while awaiting service or repair. \n78\n And the waste incident to the use of shop tools and machinery long since rendered obsolete by progress in the art must be stopped. \n 79\n\u00a0\n\n Thus, the efficient post-war railroad plant differs widely even from the efficient one of 1914. That during the recapture period here in question the plants of most of \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 530]\n\u00a0\n the railroads of the United States built before the war were lacking in improved instruments of transportation made available by recent progress in the art is of common knowledge. \n80\n That this is true even to-day of many of the railroads will not be denied. \n81\n To the extent that there is inefficiency in plant, there was and is functional depreciation, lessening actual value. That this functional depreciation, arising through external changes, through \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 531]\n\u00a0\n competitive means of transportation, and through progress in the art of transportation, may, in respect to a particular railroad, have become so large as to more than counterbalance that increase in its actual value which would otherwise flow from the rise in the price level since 1914, seems clear.\n It may be urged that the continued use of the inefficient plant,82 and the repairing rather than replacement of its antiquated parts,83 has been due to lack of capital and \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 532]\n\u00a0\n insufficient revenues. \n84\n Such an excuse for failing to install the improved plant might have been conclusive if prudent investment had been accepted as the measure of value. But the fact that the management may have been wholly free from blame in continuing to use the inefficient parts obviously does not add to their actual value. The actual value of an existing plant, and the difference between its value and the present cost of constructing a modern efficient plant which will render the service, is precisely the same whether the continued use of the obsolete part was due to lack of capital, or to lack of good judgment, or to somnolence on the part of the management. As was said in Board of Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 32\n, 46 S. Ct. 363, 366 (70 L. Ed. 808): 'Customers pay for service, not for the property used to render it.' Only the then service value of the property is of legal significance under the rule of Smyth v. Ames.\n It may also be urged that such functional depreciation of the railroad plant since 1914 is allowed for in the depreciation customarily estimated by the Commission. But this is not true. Functional depreciation prior to June 30, 1914, was included when valuing as of that date \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 533]\n\u00a0\n the then property of the railroads. But the instructions of the Commission provided that functional depreciation arising after that date should not be considered unless 'imminent.' And the Commission made clear that it did not intend by the term to include functional depreciation of the character described above arising from external causes, from the competition of new methods of transportation, from the extraordinary urban growth, from the need of new economies arising from the largely increased labor and fuel costs, and from other incidents of the war and post-war developments in industry and transportation. Texas Midland R. R., 75 I. C. C. 1, 47-52, 124-130. Compare, Depreciation Charges on Steam Railroads, 118 I. C. C. 295.85\n If weight is to be given to reproduction cost in making the valuation of any railroad for rate-making purposes under section 19a and section 15a, there must be a determination of the functional depreciation of the individual plant as compared with a modern, efficient plant adequate to perform the same service. To make such a determination for any railroad involves a detailed inquiry into the character and condition of all those parts of the plant which may have reduced functional value because of the post-war changes affecting transportation above referred to, and also into the character and the volume of the carrier's business. For the efficient plant means that plant which is economical and efficient for the particular carrier in view of the peculiar requirements and possibilities of its own business. To make such a determination justly, the Commission must have the data on which a competent and vigilant management would insist when required to pass upon the advisability of making capital \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 534]\n\u00a0\n expenditures. And the Commission would be obliged to give them the same careful consideration. The determination of the extent of functional depreciation is thus a very serious task-a task far more serious than that of determining merely physical depreciation.\n To make such a determination of functional depreciation annually for each of the railroads of the United States would be a stupendous task, involving perhaps prohibitive expense. To make the necessary decisions promptly would seem impossible, among other reasons, because railroad valuation is but a small part of the many duties of the Commission. On the other hand, to adjust rates so as to render a fair return, and to provide through the recapture provision funds in aid of the weaker railroad, are tasks which Congress deemed urgent; and which must be promptly performed if its purpose is to be achieved. Obviously Congress intended that in making the necessary valuations under section 15a a method should be pursued by which the task which it imposed upon the Commission could be performed. Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. Recognizing this, the Commission construed section 15a as it had paragraph (f) of section 19a; that is, as permitting the Commission to make a basic valuation as of some general date (June 30, 1914, was selected), and, unless good reason to the contrary appeared, to find the value for any year thereafter by adding to or substracting from the 1914 value the net increases or decreases in the investment in property devoted to transportation service as determined from the carrier's annual returns with due regard to the element of depreciation. \n86\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 461, 535]\n\u00a0\n Eighth. The significance, in connection with current reproduction costs, of the requirement in section 15a that value be ascertained 'for rate-making purposes' as there defined becomes apparent when the position of railroads, in this respect, is compared with that of most local utilities enjoying a monopoly of a necessary of life. The fundamental question in the Southwestern Bell Case was one of substantive constitutional law, namely: Is the rate base on which the Constitution guarantees to a public utility the right to earn a fair return the actual value of the property at the time of the rate hearing, or is it the cost or capital prudently invested in the enterprise? The court decided that the rate base is the actual value at the time of the rate hearing. That proposition of substantive law the Commission undertook to apply to the facts presented in the case at bar. Recognizing that evidence of increased reconstruction costs is admissible for the purpose of showing an actual value greater than the original cost or the prudent investment, it found in respect to some of the carrier's property that the evidence of enhanced reconstruction cost was persuasive of higher present value. As to the rest of the property, it held that the evidence was neither adequate nor persuasive.\n Of both railroads and the local utility it is true, under the rule of substantive law adopted in the Southwestern Bell Case, that value is the sum on which a fair return can be earned consistently with the laws of trade and legal enactments. But the operative scope upon railroads of the limitations so imposed upon the rates, and \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 536]\n\u00a0\n hence upon values, is much greater than in the case of local utilities. \n87\n Rail rates are being constantly curbed by the competition of markets and of rival means of transportation. Rail rates are curbed also by the influence of high rates upon the desires of individuals. The public can, to a considerable extent, do without rail service. If the rates are excessive, traffic falls off. Thus when passenger rates are too high, travel is either curtailed or people employ other means of transportation. But the service rendered by a local water company in a populous city is practically indispensable to every inhabitant. There can be no substitute for water, and to escape taking the service is practically impossible; for an alternative means of supply is rarely available. Even the common business incentive of establishing low prices in order to induce an enlarged volume of sales is absent, since the volume of the business done by a water company will not be appreciably affected by a raising or lowering of the rates, except in so far as water in quantity is used for manufacturing purposes. In other words, the commercial limitation upon rates-what the traffic will bear-is to a large extent absent in the case of such a local monopoly. The city water user must submit to such rates as the utility chooses to impose, unless they are curbed by legislative enactment.\n The legal limitations upon rates (so potent in the case of railroads) are, in the main, inoperative in the case of such a water company. Rail rates are sometimes held illegal because the exaction is greater than the value of the service to the shipper. There is in fact no corresponding limitation upon water rates. The charge is so small, as compared with the inconvenience which would be \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 537]\n\u00a0\n suffered in doing without the service, that the worth to the water taker could rarely be doubted. The prohibition of discrimination against persons, places, or articles of commerce which so frequently interferes to prevent railroads from charging higher rates, although the traffic would easily bear them, affords no protection to city water users, and seldom causes a loss of revenue to the water company. There is in respect to the water rates no prohibition comparable to that embodied in the long and short haul clause, which has an important effect in limiting rail rates. Hence, under the rule of substantive law declared in the Southwestern Bell Case, practically the only limitation imposed upon water rates is the denial to the utility of rates which will yield an excessive return upon the actual value of the property. In applying that rule of substantive law, the then actual cost of reproducing the plant would (assuming it to be efficient) commonly be persuasive evidence of its actual value, as the current cost of reproducing the vessel was held to be in Standard Oil Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 45 S. Ct. 465.\n It is true that, in the Southwestern Bell Case, the court passed also upon a subsidiary question-the weight and effect of the evidence of reconstruction cost. But the question of adjective law arose upon a record very different from that in the case at bar; and the action of the Commission here is entirely consistent with that decision. In the Southwestern Bell Case direct testimony as to the then value of the property was introduced. The efficiency of the plant was unquestioned. Witnesses had testified both to the actual cost of constructing identical property at that time, and that the specific property under consideration was worth at least 25 per cent. more than the estimate of the state commission. The court believed those witnesses. Concluding that this direct and uncontradicted evidence had been ignored by the state commission be \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 538]\n\u00a0\n cause of error as to the governing rule of substantive law, this court set aside the rate order as confiscatory, saying: 'We think the proof shows that for the purposes of the present case, the valuation should be at least $25,000,000.' \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 546 (67 L. Ed. 981, 31 A. L. R. 807).\n The action of the Commission in the case at bar was consistent also with McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400\n, 47 S. Ct. 144, and Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679\n, 43 S. Ct. 675. Each of these water companies enjoyed a local monopoly of an indispensable service. In order to provide a substitute, the community would have either to take the utility's property by eminent domain; or, if it was free to do so, build a competing plant. There was practically no commercial limitation upon the earning power of these water companies except the extent of the local market, and practically no legal limitation except the requirement that the rates charged should not be so high as to yield an excessive return upon the actual value of the utility's property. The current cost of constructing, then, a plant substantially like the utility's (assuming it to be efficient) would be persuasive evidence of its actual value. For upon that issue, concerning a local water monopoly, the inquiry would naturally be: How much would it cost the community to substitute for the private monopoly a publicly owned plant? But evidence of the cost of reconstructing a railroad built before 1914 might, for the reasons stated above, be no indication whatever of its postwar value for rate-making purposes under section 15a. And where, as in the case at bar, the probative force of the evidence may be considered free from any question of confiscation, the rule declared in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S. Ct. 527, which requires in confiscation cases a judicial determination on the weight of the evidence, does not apply.\n Ninth. A further question of construction requires consideration. It is suggested that, even if the Commission \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 539]\n\u00a0\n is not required to give effect to the higher price level when finding values for rate-making purposes under section 15a, it must do so when fixing the amount of the excess income to be recaptured from a particular railroad under paragraphs 6 to 18. The language of the section affords a short answer to that contention. The valuation prescribed in paragraph 4 is declared to be 'for the purposes of this section'-that is, for recapture purposes as well as for rate making. And paragraph 6, which provides for the recapture. declares: 'The value of such railway property shall be determined by the Commission in the manner provided in paragraph ( 4).'\n The recapture of excess earnings and the establishment of reserves are a part of the process of establishing such rates 'that carriers as a whole (or as a whole in each of such rate groups or territories as the Commission may from time to time designate) will, under honest, efficient and economical management, ... earn an aggregate annual net railway operating income equal, as nearly as may be, to a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation.' Paragraph 2.\n The recapture and reserve are the readjustment made necessary- 'inasmuch as it is impossible (without regulation and control in the interest of the commerce of the United States considered as a whole) to establish uniform rates upon competitive traffic which will adequately sustain all the carriers which are engaged in such traffic and which are indispensable to the communities to which they render the service of transportation, without enabling some of such carriers to receive a net railway operating income substantially and unreasonably in excess of a fair return upon the value of their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, it is hereby declared \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 540]\n\u00a0\n that any carrier which receives such an income so in excess of a fair return, shall hold such part of the excess, as hereinafter prescribed, as trustee for, and shall pay it to, the United States.' Paragraph 5.\n Thus, the direction in the order here challenged to pay or reserve the excess over 6 per cent. of the amounts earned from 1920 to 1923 by rates established pursuant to Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220, is merely a readjustment of those rates.\n Tenth. The question remains whether the Commission, in valuing the structural property acquired before June 30, 1914, abused its discretion by declining to give effect to the evidence of enhanced reconstruction cost. \n88\n The O'Fallon insists that the Commission, in fact, adopted a mathematical formula; that it declined to determine the present value of the carrier's property in accordance with 'the flexible and rational rule of Smyth v. Ames, under which value is a matter of judgment to be determined by a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances'; that it erected 'an arbitrary standard of its own based on no relevant facts'; that, if it had given consideration to all relevant facts and circumstances, including as one its cost of reproduction at current prices, 'the value found must have been substantially higher'; and that its primary purpose was to determine the amount of the investment in the carriers' property. In short, the O'Fallon asserts that the Commission refused to find actual value, and, instead, found the prudent investment. \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 541]\n\u00a0\n In support of this assertion, the O'Fallon points to the statement in the report that 'the value of the property of railroads for rate-making purposes ... approaches more nearly the reasonable and necessary investment in the property than the cost of reproducing it at a particular time.' Page 41. The statement just quoted does not mean that the Commission accepted prudent investment as a measure of value. It means merely that the Commission deemed the estimated original cost a better indication of actual value than the estimated reconstruction cost. While this court declared in the Southwestern Bell Case that prudent investment is not to be taken as the measure of value, it has never held that prudent investment may not be accepted as evidence of value, or that a finding of value is necessarily erroneous if it happens to be more nearly coincident with what may be supposed to have been the cost of the property than with its estimated reproduction cost. The single-sum values found by the Commission do not coincide either with the estimated prudent investment or with the estimated reconstruction cost. They are much nearer the estimated original cost of the property than they are to its estimated reproduction cost. But the values found do not conform to any formula. \n89\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 461, 542]\n\u00a0\n The general method pursued by the Commission in reaching its conclusion closely resembles that approved by the Court in Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 629\n, 630 S., 43 S. Ct. 680. It appeared that the O'Fallon Railroad had been constructed long prior to June 30, 1914. The Commission had before it 'the cost of reproduction new of the structural portion of this property estimated on the basis of our 1914 unit prices, coupled with the knowledge that costs of reproduction so arrived at were not greatly different from the original costs.' As bearing upon the value of those parts of the railroad's property which were added or replaced later, the Commission had the actual cost. As bearing on the then value of the railroad land, it had current values of adjacent lands. It had evidence concerning the railroad and the character and volume of its traffic, the working capital, revenues, and expenses. It had evidence of increased price levels after 1914 and estimates of current reproduction costs during the recapture periods.\n The carrier insisted that physically the property had appreciated more than it had depreciated, and urged the Commission to take as the basic measure of value the 'cost of reproduction new at current prices to the exclusion of everything else, or at least of everything that might tend to a lower value.' 124 I. C. C. 28. This the Commission declined to do. It gave full effect to increased current market values in determining the value of the land. It gave to the additions and betterments made after June 30, 1914, a value approximating their cost less physical depreciation. 90 But, in respect to structural \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 543]\n\u00a0\n property and equipment acquired before June 30, 1914, it declined to give weight to the evidence introduced to show current reproduction costs greater than those of 1914. It concluded, despite the estimates of higher reconstruction costs, that, except for the additions, the actual value of this part of the O'Fallon Railroad had not increased; and it found the single sum value for rate-making purposes in 1920 to be $856,065; in 1921, $ 875,360; in 1922, $978,874; in 1923, $978,246.\n The Commission recognized, as stated in Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 754 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18), that the determination of value is 'not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.' Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 630\n, 43 S. Ct. 680. It states that 'it considered and weighed carefully, in the light of its own knowledge and experience, each fact, circumstance and condition called to its attention on behalf of the carrier' as well as the evidence otherwise introduced; and that 'from this accumulation of information we have formed our judgments as to the fair basic single-sum values, not by the use of any formula but after consideration of all relevant facts.' The report makes clear that its finding was the result of an exercise of judgment upon all the evidence; that the Commission accorded to the evidence of reconstruction cost all the probative force to which it deemed that evidence entitled on the issue of actual value; and that it considered, as bearing upon value, not only the probable cost and the estimated reproduction cost, but also 'descriptions of the carrier, of its traffic, of the territory in which it operates, its history, and summaries of the results of its operation.' Page 25.\n The difficulties by which the Commission was confronted when requested to apply the evidence of reproduction cost can hardly be exaggerated. In the first place, the evidence was of such a character that it did \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 544]\n\u00a0\n not satisfactorily establish what would have been the current cost of reproduction during the recapture periods. \n91\n During the years here in question there was practically no construction of new lines. \n92\n Thus, the current cost of reproduction for those years had to be obtained by using index figures as the basis for a guess as to what it would cost to build then the identical railroad. To give \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 545]\n\u00a0\n to such figures effect as proving what it would then have cost to reproduce the O'Fallon Railroad, it must be assumed that there had not been introduced since June 30, 1914, new cost-saving methods of construction which would overcome, in whole or in part, the effect of the higher price level upon the cost of reproducing the identical property. This, in view of its experience, the Commission properly declined to do.93 In the second place, there was a lack of evidence to show to what extent, if any, higher reconstruction cost, in the several recapture periods, implied a value higher than that theretofore prevailing. \n94\n The Commission believed that it could act only on proof; that it was not required or permitted to base findings on conjecture; and that to assign. under the circumstances, any weight to the evidence of reconstruction cost would be mere conjecture.\n Moreover, the Commission had, through its valuation department, special knowledge of the property of this carrier. It had acquired necessarily in the performance of its many duties the general knowledge, already referred to, \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 546]\n\u00a0\n concerning changes in transportation conditions and of the advances in the art; and it knew how great was their effect upon the actual values of railroad property. The value of the O'Fallon Railway not having been finally ascertained under section 19a, it was obliged by paragraph 4 to utilize 'the results of its investigation under section 19a of this act in so far as deemed by it available.' The evidence introduced in the recapture proceedings showed, among other things, that of the five locomotives in the O'Fallon's service December 31, 1920, one had been built as early as 1874, and that their average age was 20.8 years; also that the aggregate outlays for additions and betterments in the railroad, less small retirements, had in eleven years been only $98,148.25. The O'Fallon did not introduce any evidence bearing upon functional depreciation of the property. The Commission may reasonably have concluded that, even if there had been introduced persuasive evidence that the cost, during the recapture periods, of reproducing new the identical plant approximated the rise in the general price level, still the actual value of the O'Fallon Railway, as it existed June 30, 1914, had not increased, because the functional depreciation plus the physical depreciation since that date counterbalanced fully what otherwise might have been the higher value of the plant.\n The O'Fallon urged that its large net earnings during the recapture periods and earlier fully established a higher value, independently of the evidence of reproduction cost. This contention ignores the peculiar character of the property. The railroad, which is owned by the Adolphus Busch estate and family and lies wholly in Illinois, operates about 9 miles of main line from two coal mines also owned by the Busch estate and family, to the tracks of the Terminal Company in East St. Louis. There are 12 miles of yardage tracks, located largely at the Busch mines. While the railroad is legally a common carrier, it is actually \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 547]\n\u00a0\n an industrial railroad. Ninety-nine per cent. of its revenues are derived directly from the carriage of coal; and, of the remaining 1 per cent., about half appears to come from a payment of $300 a month made by the Busch Coal Company for carrying its miners to and from its mines. Besides the coal from the Busch mines, there is a substantial but diminishing amount carried under a long-time contract from two mines located on an electric road, the East St. Louis & Suburban Railway, which crosses the O'Fallon. This coal it carries from the junction to East St. Louis. See St. Louis & O'Fallon Ry. Co. v. East St. Louis & Suburban Ry. Co., 81 I. C. C. 538. Obviously the value of this railroad property is wholly dependent upon the operation of the mines.\n How long the four mines will continue to be operated was and still is entirely uncertain. Their product is subject to the competition of 221 other bituminous coal mines in Illinois. These, which are all located on other railroads, enjoy low rates to St. Louis. See Perry Coal Co. v. Alton & Southern R. R., 5 Illinois Commerce Commission, 461. The vicissitudes of coal mining, the diminishing use of coal since the war because of increased fuel efficiency, the competition of oil as fuel, and the growing use of hydroelectric power are matters of common knowledge, as are the diminishing operations during recent years of the Illinois coal mines as compared with the mines in nonunion territory. \n95\n Moreover, the decline in the volume of traffic, the reduction in coal rates made by Reduced Rates, 1922, 68 I. C. C. 676, and the growing expenses of the carrier due to increased pay roll, were put in evidence by it. In view of these facts, the Commission was clearly justified in refusing to find that the railroad had a higher value than in 1914, although the net earning \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 548]\n\u00a0\n as reported showed a return for the earlier period averaging 7 1\/2 per cent. upon the amount claimed as reproduction cost.\n This court has no concern with the correctness of the Commission's reasoning on the evidence in making its findings of fact, since it applied the rules of substantive law prescribed by Congress and reached its findings of actual value by the exercise of its judgment upon all the evidence, including enhanced construction costs. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 666 S., 47 S. Ct. 222; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 580\n, 47 S. Ct. 727. We must bear in mind that here we are not dealing with a question of confiscation; that we are dealing, as was pointed out in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 527\n, 18 S. Ct. 418, 426 (42 L. Ed. 819), with a legislative question which can 'be more easily determined by a commission composed of persons whose special skill, observation and experience qualifies them to so handle great problems of transportation as to do justice both to the public and to those whose money has been used to construct and maintain highways for the convenience and benefit of the people.'\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I agree with what Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has said, and add a word only by way of emphasis of those aspects of the case which appear to me sufficient, apart from all other considerations, to sustain the finding of the Commission.\n The report of the Interstate Commerce Commission is rejected and its order set aside on the sole ground that, in a recapture proceeding under section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15a), it has failed to consider present reproduction cost or value of appellant's property and so to 'give \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 549]\n\u00a0\n due consideration to all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate making purposes.' No constitutional question is involved.\n The Commission was called upon to value a railroad, with less than 9 miles of main line track, which had been constructed prior to 1900. Much of its equipment was purchased before 1908; a considerable part being secondhand. Its traffic was very largely dependent on the output of a few coal mines which it served.\n In performing its task, the Commission had before it the cost of reproduction new of appellant's structural property, estimated on the basis of 1914 unit prices, 'with the knowledge that the costs of reproduction so arrived at were not greatly different from the original costs.' It had evidence of the actual cost of later additions and replacements, of the physical condition of the railroad and equipment, of the character, volume, and sources of its traffic, of its working capital and revenues and expenses. It possessed, through its valuation department, special knowledge of the property of this carrier. Through its own experience it had the benefit of an expert knowledge of all the factors affecting value of railway property growing out of changes in methods of transportation, of improvement in transportation appliances, and the consequent obsolescence of existing equipment, of improvement in methods of railroad construction and consequent reductions in cost. Although it had estimates of present construction costs in the form of index figures based on the comparative general price levels of labor and materials for 1914 and each of the recapture years, which it considered and discussed in its report, there was no evidence before it of the actual present cost of construction of this or any other railroad or any affirmative showing that, if appellant's road was to be built and equipped anew, competent railroad engineers would deem the present structure and equipment suitable for or adapt- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 550]\n\u00a0\n able to the economical and efficient management contemplated by the statute.\n After stating that it had before it the evidence above outlined, including that of reproduction cost, and such other matters as the carrier desired to bring to its attention, the Commission added, 'From this accumulated information we have formed our judgment as to the fair basic single sum values, not by the use of any formula, but after consideration of all relevant facts.' That the Commission gave consideration to present reproduction costs appears not only from its own statement, but from the fact that it gave full effect to increased current market values in determining the value of land and to additions and betterments since June 30, 1914, taken at their cost less depreciation. In the light of those considerations which affect the present value of appellant's structural property which Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has mentioned, I cannot say that the Commission did not have before it the requisite data for forming a trustworthy judgment of the value of appellant's road or that it failed to give to proof of reproduction cost all the weight to which it was entitled on its merits. Had the Commission not turned aside to point out in its report the economic fallacies of the use of reproduction cost as a standard of value for rate-making purposes, which it nevertheless considered and to some extent applied, I suppose it would not have occurred to any one to question the validity of its order.\n I cannot avoid the conclusion that, in substance, the objection, now upheld, to the order of the Commission, is not that it failed to consider or give appropriate weight to evidence of present reproduction cost of appellant's road, but that it attached less weight to present construction costs than to other factors before it affecting adversely the present value of the structural property. That this was the real nature of the objection voiced by the dissenting Commissioners seems to me apparent from their opin- \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 551]\n\u00a0\n ion. They seem to assume that, as a result of Southwestern Tel. Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, and other cases in this court, the Commission as a matter of law may never, under any circumstances, find that the value of the structural part of a railroad does not exceed its fair value of an earlier date, if the Commission has before it evidence of later increased construction costs. They say, 'under the law of the land,' in valuing a railroad under section 15a 'we must accord weight in the legal sense to the greatly enhanced cost of material, labor and supplies' during the recapture periods. Weight in the legal sense is evidently taken to be not that accorded by an informed judgment but imposed by some positive rule of law.\n Without discussion of the evidence and other data which received the consideration of the Commission, the opinion of this court seems to proceed on the broad assumption that the evidence relied on, mere synthetic estimates of costs of reproduction, must so certainly and necessarily outweigh all other considerations affecting values as to require the order of the Commission to be set aside. In effect the Commission is required to give to such index figures an evidential value to which it points out they are not entitled when applied to railroad properties in general or to this one in particular, and this, so far as appears, without investigation of the soundness of the reasons of the Commission for rejecting them.\n This court has said that present reproduction costs must be considered in ascertaining value for rate-making purposes. But it has not said that such evidence, when fairly considered, may not be outweighed by other considerations affecting value, or that any evidence of present reproduction costs, when compared with all the other factors affecting value, must be given a weight to which it is not entitled in the judgment of the tribunal 'informed by experience' and 'appointed by law' to deal with the \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 552]\n\u00a0\n very problem now presented. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700. But, if 'weight in the legal sense' must be given to evidence of present construction costs, by the judgment now given we do not lay down any legal rule which will inform the Commission how much weight, short of its full effect, to the exclusion of all other considerations, is to be given to the evidence of synthetic costs of construction in valuing a railroad property. If full effect were to be given to it in all cases, then, as the Commission points out in its report, the railroads of the country, valued by the Commission in 1920 at nineteen billion dollars, would have had in that year a reproduction value of forty billion dollars, and we would arrive at the economic paradox that the value of the railroads may be far in excess of any amount on which they could earn a return. If less than full effect may be given, it is difficult for me to see how, without departure from established principles, the Commission could be asked to do more than it has already done-to weigh the evidence guided by all the proper considerations-or how, if there is evidence upon which its findings may rest, we can substitute our judgment for that of the Commission. Such, I believe, is the 'due consideration' which the statute requires of 'all the elements of value recognized by the law of the land for ratemaking purposes.'\n As I cannot say a priori that increased construction costs may not be more than offset by other elements affecting adversely the present value of appellant's property, and as there was evidence before the Commission to support its findings, I can only conclude that the judgment below should be affirmed. In any case, in view of the statement of the Commission that it considered all relevant facts, including the elements of value brought to its attention by the carrier, I should not have supposed that we could rightly set aside the present order without some \n\n[279 U.S. 461, 553]\n\u00a0\n consideration of the probative value of the evidence of present reproduction costs which the Commission discussed at length in its report.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Section 15a. (1) (This defines the terms employed.)\n (2) In the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates the Commission shall initiate, modify, establish or adjust such rates so that carriers as a whole (or as a whole in each of such rate groups or territories as the Commission may from time to time designate) will, under honest, efficient and economical management and reasonable expenditures for maintenance of way, structures and equipment, earn an aggregate annual net railway operating income equal, as nearly as may be, to a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation: Provided, That the Commission shall have reasonable latitude to modify or adjust any particular rate which it may find to be unjust or unreasonable, and to prescribe different rates for different sections of the county.\n (3) The Commission shall from time to time determine and make public what percentage of such aggregate property value constitutes a fair return thereon, and such percentage shall be uniform for all rate groups or territories which may be designated by the Commission. In making such determination it shall give due consideration, among other things, to the transportation needs of the country and the necessity (under honest, efficient and economical management of existing transportation facilities) of enlarging such facilities in order to provide the people of the United States with adequate transportation: Provided, That during the two years beginning March 1, 1920, the Commission shall takes as such fair return a sum equal to 5 1\/2 per centum of such aggregate value, but may, in its discretion, add thereto a sum not exceeding one-half of one per centum of such aggregate value to make provision in whole or in part for improvements, betterments or equipment, which, according to the accounting system prescribed by the Commission, are chargeable to capital account. 41 Stat. 488. \n (5) Inasmuch as it is impossible (without regulation and control in the interest of the commerce of the United States considered as a whole) to establish uniform rates upon competitive traffic which will adequately sustain all the carriers which are engaged in such traffic and which are indispensable to the communities to which they render the service of transportation, without enabling some of such carriers to receive a net railway operating income substantially and unreasonably in excess of a fair return upon the value of their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, it is hereby declared that any carrier which receives such an income so in excess of a fair return shall hold such part of the excess, as hereinafter prescribed, as trustee for, and shall pay it to, the United States.\n (7) For the purpose of paying dividends or interest on its stocks, bonds or other securities, or rent for leased roads, a carrier may draw from the reserve fund established and maintained by it under the provisions of this section to the extent that its net railway operating income for any year is less than a sum equal to 6 per centum of the value of the railway property held for and used by it in the service of transportation, determined as provided in paragraph (6); but such fund shall not be drawn upon for any other purpose.\n (8) Such reserve fund need not be accumulated and maintained by any carrier beyond a sum equal to 5 per centum of the value of its railway property determined as herein provided, and when such fund is so accumulated and maintained the portion of its excess income which the carrier is permitted to retain under paragraph (6) may be used by it for any lawful purpose. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Report of Senate Committee reporting S. 3288, Report No. 307, p. 19, 66th Congress, 1st Session: 'The Company reserve fund may be drawn upon by the carrier whenever its annual railway operating income falls below 6 per cent. of the valus of the property. The reserve fund is, of course, the absolute property of the carrier; and the purpose in requiring it to be established and maintained is to give stability to the credit of the carrier and enable it to render more efficiently the public service in which it is engaged.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The complaint concerns all the structural property and equipment acquired before June 30, 1919. But, as nearly all of this had been installed before July 1, 1914, the discussion is limited to the property acquired before that date. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Best on Evidence (7th Eng.

It was said to have a physical value of between $ 16,000,000 and $20,000,000.

C. 39): 'In this connection it is significant that when the legislation of 1920, of which  15a is a part, was under congressional consideration there was offered in behalf of the carriers a proposed bill in which their recorded investment in road and equipment was made the sole element in the determination of the rate base. It is also worthy of note that when the legislation of 1920 was under such consideration a representative of this commission on September 26, 1919, in response to a question, publicly informed the congressional committee that he knew of no warrant for an assumption 'that the commission will base the value of the property wholly or in part on present prices.\"\n The investment in road and equipment as stated on the books of the Kansas City, Mexico & Orient Railroad Company (of Kansas) as of June 30, 1919, was $22,190,935. The final valuation by the Commission as of that date was $6,453,528. After that date $1,064,782 was expended for additions and betterments, making a total value of $7,518,310.

Senate Reports, No. 304, vol. 1, 66th Cong. 1st Sess. A rate base which reflected the then increase in price levels over 1914 would have yielded about $700,000,000 more than the income of the test period. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Senator Kellogg in the debate on the bill justified the 5 1\/2 per cent. return by the same argument as used by the Committee in reporting the bill: 'Again it must be remembered that 5 1\/2 per cent. today is not equal to 5 1\/2 per cent. five years age. The great inflation of currency and the general rise in all commodities have made a dollar very much less in purchasing power.' 59 Cong. Rec. pt. 1, p. 224. The same recognition of increased costs had been given as a justification for the liberal return authorized by the Federal Control Act. 1916 and 1917, two of the three years taken as a basis for measuring the return, were the most prosperous in the history of the railroads. See 56 Cong. Rec. pt. II, p. 2021. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Mr. Esch, in submitting the conference report to the House, said: 'Investors want something definite and fixed upon which they can reckon. The provisions of section 422 give that stability, that standard which I trust, will encourage investment. ...' 59 Cong. Rec., pt. 4, p. 3269. The Commission points out (page 32): 'In other words, assuming a static property (valued at $18,000,000,000) there would have been a gain of 23.4 billions in 1920, a loss of 6.3 billions in 1921, a further loss of 6.8 billions in 1922, and a gain again of 3 billions in 1923. These huge 'profits' and 'losses' would have occurred without change in the railroad property used in the public service other than the theoretical and speculative change, derived from a shifting of general price levels.' \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] 'During the seven years 1920 to 1926, inclusive, there was an approximate net investment in additions and betterments and new construction of 4 billions. These were paid for at then current prices, all above, in many cases far above, present prices. Assuming that there has since been an average decline in unit price level of 25 per cent., a valuation under the current reproduction cost doctrine would wipe out one billion of that additional investment. The effect upon any railroad entirely or largely constructed during the period 1920 to 1926 may be imagined.' Page 32. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The value of the plant is 'a result of the rates rather than a basis for rates. ... If rates are established upon a basis of reproduction cost, value will tend to approximate such cost, but this will be through the operation of economic law and not because a certain figure has been decreed as value.'

Many illustrations of this are afforded by applications made under section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  6) for permission, because of motor, competition, to change rates on less than 30 days' notice. In the period from November 23, 1928, to March 19, 1929, six such applications were made by the Boston & Maine Railroad, five by the New York, New Haven & Hartford, and two by the Boston & Albany. In one instance the rate was reduced to less than one-half; in another to just one-half; and in the others by varying percentages. The reductions related, among others, to articles as bulky as crushed stone and lumber, and as heavy as scrap iron and wire rods. Among such applicatiions made by western lines in 1928, are those of the Southern Pacific and Atchison for carload rates on sugar (Nos. 87,723, 87,724) and on dried fruits (86,227), and that of the Southern Pacific for carload rates on iron or steel pipe ( No. 90,219).\n In a paper delivered before the Mid-West Transportation Conference, R. C. Morse, general superintendent, Pennsylvania Railroad, said: 'The truck has proved more economical than the box car for the transportation of less than carload freight for short hauls and, under special circumstances, for comparatively long hauls.' Railway Review 1925, vol. 76, p. 1116.\n In an address before the Western Railway Club, T. C. Powell, president, Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railway, said: 'The great change, therefore, that has taken place since 1920 has been this growth of automobile traffic, and by this I mean not simply the ownership of automobiles, but the diversion to the passenger automobile and freight motor truck of a large number of passengers and a large tonnage of freight, respectively, of the character heretofore handled by the steam carriers, and this loss of gross-revenue producing traffic has brought about a reduction in train service on main lines as well as on branch lines, which has a very marked effect upon the number of employees engaged in train service.'

The specific provision, requiring efficiency and economy, was doubtless inserted in section 15a because the Commission had theretofore expressed a doubt as to the extent to which it could, in determining the reasonableness of rates, consider the efficiency and economy of the management. Compare Advances in Rates- Eastern Case, 20 I. C. C. 243, 278-280. This provision must be read in the light of paragraph (5) of section 20, also added to the Interstate Commerce Act by Transportation Act 1920, 49 USCA  20(5), which directed the Commission to prescribe what depreciation charges should be allowed as a part of the operating expenses. \n\n[\nFootnote 52\n] Harry Gunnison Brown, 'Present Costs,' p. 6 (reprinted from Public Utilities Fortnightly, March 7, 1929); F.

Scarr, supervisor motor service, Pennsylvania Railroad, said: 'We are conducting inefficient terminal operations through inadequate facilities, and by means of antiquated methods. ... Before the general acceptance of the motor vehicle as a dependable means of transportation, we had only the horse drawn vehicle available for the movement of freight over the highways. The limited effective radius of action, slow speed, and low capacity, of this instrument forced the railroads to place on track freight stations as near the centers of production and consumption as possible, almost regardless of cost or future expansion, requirements. This factor, with reckless competition between carriers, influenced the railroads to engage in what approaches retail transportation, by the establishing of innumerable small stations and private sidings. It is my firm conviction that had the motor truck, with its greater radius of action, greater capacity, greater flexibility, and greater endurance, been available, the carriers would have developed terminals better adapted to take advantage of these characteristics.' Railway Review 1926, vol. 78, p. 790. \n[\nFootnote 54\n] \"The time is fast approaching when railroads will stop buying expensive downtown city property for freight houses, and will, by the use of trucks, handle freight from outside and less costly freight houses direct to consignees' door.' ... Where is the economy in hauling freight into terminals situated on the most valuable land in Chicago, and why should this same freight be hauled through Chicago's most congested district for delivery? ... The delays in switching, due to congestion, are so costly that their elimination, if only in part, would pay very handsome dividends on a very large capital investment.'

C. 243, 271: 'Assume that a railroad is originally constructed over a mountain, it being more economical to haul the traffic up and down the steep grades than to incur the great outlay which would be required by constructing a tunnel. With the development of traffic the time comes when this mountain must be pierced, and a tunnel is accordingly constructed at a large expenditure. When the tunnel is put into service and the line over the mountain abandoned the cost of the tunnel is added and the cost of the abandoned railroad subtracted from construction cost, so that, as shown by the books, the cost of construction is the same as though the tunnel had been built at the outset.' \n\n[\nFootnote 56\n] C. A. Morse, chief engineer, Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway, in an address before the Western Society of Engineers in 1926, said: 'Comparatively little has been done in the reduction of grades and today a great majority of the trunk line railroads in this country are operating over grade lines that were considered economical 50 or 75 years ago. These railroads were built in the days before steam shovels and other mechanical grading devices had been developed, and when rock was handled with hand drills, black powder and carts. The result was that grading was very expensive and they sought to minimize it. ... The reduction in the ruling grade and in the rate of curvature will result in both cheaper transportation and a saving in time. ... During the last twenty-five years, it has been the practice of most railroads to reduce their grades in connection with the construction of a second track, but unfortunately additional main track has been constructed on many of the older roads before the value of the lighter ruling grade was appreciated. The reduction of grade means practically the rebuilding of such lines and the expense of this together with the interruption to traffic while it is being done has prevented much of this from being carried out for unless the subject is thoroughly investigated, we are apt to consider it as impracticable. ... Simply maintaining in first class condition a roadway that, as far as grades and alinement are concerned, is of a type such as was constructed a half century ago, is not maintaining a modern railroad . ... With the great majority of the railroads operating over lines that have the grade line and curvature of a half century ago, the big job is to modernize the roadway.' Railway Age, vol. 80.1, p. 279. See, also, Engineering News-Record, vol. 96.1, p. 309; volume 96.2, p. 803; Railway Review, vol. 72, p. 937; volume 73, p. 124; volume 78, p. 187; Railway Age, vol 81.1, p. 181. \n[\nFootnote 57\n] 'Curves, it is a matter of long record, have an important relation to speed of trains and cost of transportation as well as to track maintenance, while very sharp curves have a relation to safety of traffic. It has been found that in a 10-year period, with no rail renewals on 1 deg. curves, the rails were renewed once on 2 deg. curves, once or twice on 3 deg., and twice on 4 degree curves. Furthermore, track displacement by traffic has necessitated double or triple the amount of surfacing on the sharper curves, and there is a correspondingly greater wear on driving wheels, so that an engine working regularly over numerous sharp curves has a shorter period of service before it has to be sent to the shop for re- turning the tires. ...'

The New York Central has just finished apending more than $20,000,000 to get freight trains around Albany and access the Hudson river without having to lower them to the river level and pull them up again. The Illinois Central is spending $16,000,000 for a straighter, flatter and more economical line through Illinois and Kentucky, crossing the Ohio river. The Southern Pacific is spending a similar sum to build its Natron cut-off in Oregon and California to get a better grade over the Siskiyous. The Central of Georgia is spending $5,000,000 to relocate and rebuild its line between Columbus, Ga. and Birmingham. The Central of New Jersey is putting a four-track steel trestle three miles across Newark Bay, a $10, 000,000 job. The Louisville & Nashville is spending $5,000,000 or more to raise and move its Gulf Coast line out of the reach of storms. The Southern Ry. is spending a couple of millions to shorten the haul and cut the grades for coal trains moving out of the Appalachian fields to the South Atlantic. These projects represent the kind of improvement that will make it possible in the future to carry on the same line of development that American railroads have followed whenever and wherever they could. Each will pay for itself in reduced transportation costs and, along with hundreds of other improvements will make possible lower rates.' Railway Review 1925, vol. 77, p. 522. \n[\nFootnote 59\n] 'If it is reasonable to expect that large amounts of heavy freight will be offered, the question of grades to be adopted is of paramount importance and should be given most careful consideration, and the lightest grades possible should be adopted, even if some increase in distance and considerable increase in cost is caused thereby, because grade and curve resistance govern the tonnage that any locomotive will haul; and as the limit in the size of the locomotive that can be built within clearances of 10 feet wide and 15 feet high has been nearly reached, we must improve our grades to secure lower costs of handling.\n'As an illustration of the importance of light grades to increase train loads and thereby reduce cost of movement, we may cite the fact that about three times as much tonnage can be hauled on a grade of two tenths, or 10.6 feet per mile, as on a grade of one per cent., or 52.8 feet per mile, with the same expenditure of energy. On a grade of four-tenth only half as much tonnage can be hauled as on a level with the same power.' F. S. Stevens, engineer maintenance of way, Phila. & Reading Railway, Railway Review 1923, vol. 72, p. 937. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 60\n] Alba B. Johnson, president of the Railway Business Association, testifying before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce in 1924, said: 'The heavier locomotives and cars and the longer trains brought about a new standard of rails, roadbed, bridges and other structures. If it were possible to show on a chart the rise in cost of replacing the railroad as a whole we would still not be telling the whole story, because the increase would represent not only a higher level of wages and prices but a change in the character of the plant. Rails and ballast are heavier, frogs and switches more powerful, bridges stronger. Capacity of track was increased by installation of signal systems. Repairs have been expedited and cheapened by new shop machinery. ... The 90 pound rail ... replaces a 60 pound rail. ... Instead of replacing worn out locomotives with new ones of the same design ... the railroad orders a type which costs more in original outlay but is expected to earn the difference by the economy with which it does the work. The same principle runs through all the schedules of the maintenance of road and equipment and additions and betterments.' Railway Age, vol. 76.2, p. 1039.

Railway Age 1921, vol. 71.2, p. 1295. \n[\nFootnote 62\n] The investment account of the railroads of the United States increased between December 31, 1919 and December 31, 1927, $5,152,751,000- that is, about 25 per cent. Nearly all of that sum was expended in improving the road, terminals, and shop facilities, and in replacing outworn and obsolete equipment. During that period the operating ratio improved greatly. The percentage of operating revenues consumed in the several years by operating expenses was: 1920, 94.38 per cent.; 1921, 82. 71 per cent.; 1922, 79.41 per cent.; 1923, 77.83 per cent.; 1924, 76.13 per cent.; 1925, 74.10 per cent.; 1926, 73.15 per cent.; 1927, 74.54 per cent. The improvement in the operating ratio (after the 1920 rate increase) was due in large measure to the improvement of the railroad plant. This made possible, among other things, a reduction in the number of employees from 2,022,832 in 1920 to 1,735,105 in 1927. The reduction in the operating ratio and in the number of employees has continued in 1928 and 1929. See Monthly Labor Review, vol. 28, No. 5, p. 215. The number of locomotives on December 31, 1927, was 3,629 less than on December 31, 1919; the number of freight cars 48,089 less.

Of these 12,000 were reported to be obsolete by the Railway Age (vol. 68.1, p. 33). Of the 2,648 locomotives in service on the B. & O., on December 31, 1920, 633 were more than twenty years old. On the Southern, 501 locomotives out of a total of 1,865; on the Erie, 474 out of 1540; on the Seaboard Air Line, 142 out of 581; on the Lackawanna, 57 out of 757; and on the Pennsylvania, 624 out of a total of 7,599, exceeded that age. In 1926 it was estimated by the editor of the Railway Age that 68 per cent. of the locomotives then in use were over ten years old. Railway Age, vol. 81.1, p. 493. In 1928 there were about 65,000 locomotives in use. Of these, according to the Railway Age (vol. 84.2, p. 950): 'There are probably between 15,000 and 20,000 locomotives in this country, 20 years old or older, which have practically none of those features of locomotive equipment that are now regarded as the ear-marks of modern motive power.' \n\n[\nFootnote 82\n] e. g. Locomotives no longer capable of pulling heavy loads, instead of being scrapped or rebuilt, have frequently been continued in use for branchline or suburban service, or in switchyards. It is said that their use in such passenger service has been rendered wasteful by the comparative economies of the modern motor rail car. See Railway Age, vol. 72.1, p. 315; volume 72.2 p. 1372; volume 76.2 p. 975; volume 82.1, p. 563; volume 83.1, p. 601; volume 84.1, p. 753; Railway and Locomotive Engineering, Feb. 1928, p. 37.

Railway Review 1924, vol. 74, p. 771. The replacement of antiquated power with modern locomotives in its switch-yards by the Seaboard Air Line Railway is estimated to have effected a savings in operating costs which will pay an annual return of 50 per cent. on the investment in the new engines.

They are purely administrative proceedings wherein we are following the direction of Congress to create a contingent fund to be used in furtherance of the public interest in railway transportation.' Excess Income of St. Louis and O'Fallon Ry. Co., 124 I. C. C. 3, 7. \n\n[\nFootnote 89\n] The O'Fallon has calculated that the single-sum values found by the Commission for the several recapture periods exceed by $32,660.88 the sums of the following amounts: (1) The cost of reproduction less depreciation, as of June 30, 1919, of all property exclusive of lands and working capital at 1914 or pre-war prices; (2) the amount by which the actual cost of the property installed between July 1, 1914, and June 30, 1919, exceeded its cost of reproduction at 1914 prices; (3) the present value of the land; (4) the allowance for working capital; (5) the actual investment in additions and betterments, less retirements, subsequent to June 30, 1919. The calculation is correct; but the assertion that the $32, 660.88 (which is about 5 per cent. of the aggregate of the other amounts) must have been allowed as overhead is without foundation in the record and is inconsistent with statements in the Commission's report. \n\n[\nFootnote 90\n] 'The method which we therefore find logical and proper for determining the value in the subsequent recapture periods is to add to or subtract from the 1919 value the net increases or decreases in the investment in property devoted to transportation service as determined from the carrier's returns to valuation order No. 3, with due regard to the element of depreciation.' 124 I. C. C. 3, passim, particularly pages 37, 42. \n\n[\nFootnote 91\n] As to the evidence the Commission said:\n'The use of cost of reproduction is by no means free from practical difficulties. For example, the record here shows that there was a dearth of reliable data from which an accurate estimate of such cost could be made for the period 1920 to 1923. In proof of this assertion reference need only be made to the sources of the data relied upon by the witnesses both for the bureau and for the carriers. Their estimates for those years were founded in large part upon manufacturers' records and price statistics appearing in various publications, and to a lesser extent upon cost of construction actually incurred by railroads in that period. There was, in fact, very little new railroad construction in those years.\n\n'Synthetic estimates of cost of reproduction based upon statistics showing price and wage changes do not make allowance for improved methods of assembly and construction. As will hereinafter be more fully indicated, we found in Texas Midland Railroad, supra, (75 I. C. C. 1) at page 140, that the increase in the cost of labor and materials between 1900 and 1914 was largely offset by improvement in the art of construction. How far there may have been a similar offset, so far as costs in the period from 1920-1923 are concerned, is not disclosed of record.' Page 29.\n\n And later (page 41): '... Even if the cost of reproduction new in 1920 were to be regarded as a controlling element there is not in the present record evidence showing what it might have cost to reproduce the property of the O'Fallon at that time. The only evidence in this respect is that of the relation of general prices in 1914 and in 1920 and the other recapture years.' \n[\nFootnote 92\n] Compare United States v. Boston, Cape Cod & New York Canal Co. (C. C. A.) 271 F. 877, 889, where the court said that the jury 'should not consider the evidence of reconstruction cost upon the question of value, unless they were satisfied that a reasonably prudent man would purchase or undertake the construction of the property at such a figure.' \n\n[\nFootnote 93\n] 'Costs of railroad building, owing to improvements in methods and economies thereby effected, did not vary greatly during the period of 20 years preceding 1914, although the prices of labor and material fluctuated. There is no testimony here as to how much it cost to build any railroad or any substantial part of one in any of the recapture periods, and for that reason it is impossible to make a comparison of such costs in the two periods. It is not safe to assume, as the O'Fallon has assumed, that costs of building railroads have varied in recent years in direct ratio to the variation in costs of commodities in general use, or in the costs of materials or labor generally. The fallacy of basing reproduction cost upon price curves or ratios is clearly indicated by the tabulations introduced by the carrier.' Page 41. \n[\nFootnote 94\n] The Commission says (page 40): 'Weighing the figures previously mentioned in the light of these considerations and the entire record, and viewing the carrier as a common carrier in successful operation and with an established business, we conclude that the value for rate-making purposes of the entire common carrier property of the O'Fallon on June 30, 1919, was $850,500.' \n\n[\nFootnote 95\n] See Geological Survey: 'Coal in 1923,' pp. 528-535.

ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE(1929)\nNo. 568\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 560, 561]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Forney Johnston, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellant.\n Mr. J. Q. Smith, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 9713 of the Code of Alabama (1923) prohibits a railroad from abandoning 'any portion of its service to the public ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the (Public Service) Commission a permit allowing such abandonment.' Very severe penalties, including punishment of officers, agents and employees, are prescribed in case the abandonment is willful. Sections 9730, 9731, 5350, 5399. Without obtaining such permission or applying therefor, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway discontinued two interstate trains by means of which it had long furnished intrastate service between several cities and towns in Alabama. Then it brought, in the federal court for the middle district of that state, this suit against the commission, the Attorney General and other officials, to enjoin the commencement of proceedings to enforce the penalties prescribed. An application for an interlocutory injunction, heard before three judges \n\n[279 U.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n under section 266, Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), was denied (D. C.) 27 F.( 2d) 893. A restraining order, issued upon the filing of the bill, was continued in force pending the determination of this appeal.\n The bill alleges that the operation of the interstate trains by which the intrastate service had long been furnished had involved the carrier in losses; that the service still furnished by other trains is adequate to supply the reasonable needs of the communities; that, upon learning of the discontinuance of the service, the commission demanded that it be restored, without first hearing the carrier; that, if section 9713, Code Ala. 1923, is construed as requiring the carrier to obtain the commission's permission before discontinuing intrastate service rendered by means of an interstate train, or as prohibiting such discontinuance although an unreasonable burden is thereby imposed upon the carrier, the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3); that, if construed as requiring, without a prior hearing, reinstatement of the service so discontinued, it violates also the due process clause; and that the matter in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional amount. The prayers are for an injunction against enforcing any penalty for discontinuance of the service or for failure to reinstate the same; and for a declaration that the statute, if construed as stated, is void under the Federal Constitution. The answer denies many of the allegations of the bill.\n The railway contends that it had no way of testing the constitutionality of the statute, otherwise than by this suit. It urges that, if it had applied to the commission for permission to discontinue the service, it would have thereby recognized its jurisdiction; and that, since the commission did not before directing reinstatement of the service issue any order to the carrier to appear, there was no action by the commission which could form the basis \n\n[279 U.S. 560, 563]\n\u00a0\n for a review in courts of the state. We have no occasion to consider the issues of fact or to determine whether the Alabama statute if construed as suggested is obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. Upon facts admitted it is clear that the carrier should not have discontinued the intrastate service without first applying to the commission for permission. No constitutional right could have been prejudiced by so doing. No emergency existed requiring immediate action. And no serious financial loss would have been incurred by the slight delay involved.

Ct. 720\n\n\n The past failure of the railway to apply for leave to discontinue the service does not, however, justify exposing it, and its officers and employe s, to the severe penalties prescribed by the statute. It may be that, upon full presentation of the facts, the commission would find that to continue the service would subject the carrier to an unreasonable burden; or the carrier may suggest some satisfactory substitute for the specific service now demanded of it. The commission should give to the railway the opportunity of presenting the facts; and, if an application is made promptly, the matter should be determined by the commission without subjecting the railway to any prejudice because of its failure to ask leave before discontinuing the service. Compare Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 228\n, 49 S. Ct. 106, 73 L. Ed. -. To this end the decree will be vacated; and the restraining order will be continued.

Ct. 177, 73 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, reversing a decree of the District Court for Kansas which enjoined the enforcement of an ordinance of respondent the city of Marysville, as in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. 27 F. (2d) 478.\n The ordinance, No. 350, of October 8, 1923, requires that all tanks within the city limits used for the storage of petroleum products or other inflammable liquids shall be buried at least 3 feet underground. Tanks of a capacity of 500 gallons or less, if used for the storage of crude oil, distillate, or fuel oil, and of less than 10 gallons, if used for the storage of gasoline, kerosene, or naphtha, are exempted from this requirement. Violation of the ordinance is punishable by a fine of $25 for each day of its continuance. Petitioners, who are dealers in petroleum products licensed under a former ordinance, have each for many years maintained within the city limits two tanks for the storage of gasoline and kerosene of approximately 12,000 gallone capacity each. They assert that compliance with the ordinance will impose upon them a large and unnecessary expense and that the ordinance is so arbitrary and capricious as applied to them as to deprive them of their property without due process of law.\n At the trial before a master voluminous evidence was taken, much of it conflicting, speculative, and theoretical in character, concerning the relative safety of the storage \n\n[279 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n of petroleum products above and beneath the surface of the earth and their relative likelihood of ignition, and danger to life and property in the vicinity if ignited, when so stored. The master made elaborate findings of fact from which he inferred generally that it is more dangerous, from the standpoint of public safety, to store underground than above, gasoline or kerosene in quantities of 10 gallons or more. From this he drew the legal conclusion, adopted by the District Court, that the ordinance was so arbitrary and capricious as not to be a permissible exercise of the police power.\n We need not labor the point, long settled, that, where legislative action is within the scope of the police power, fairly debatable questions as to its reasonableness, wisdom, and propriety are not for and determination of courts, but for that of the legislative body on which rests the duty and responsibility of decision.

Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 451\n, 35 S. Ct. 892. To determine that the present ordinance was a permissible exercise of legislative discretion, as thus defined, we need not go beyond those findings of the master to which petitioners offer no serious challenge.\n The master found that gasoline and kerosene stored in large quantities are dangerously inflammable substances, as we judicially know, Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, \n248 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 39 S. .S Ct. 172, which, when ignited, are a menace to life and property in the vicinity; that even with the use of the most modern safety devices, fires or explosions of such storage tanks occur; and that within the four years preceding the trial five disastrous fires of gasoline \n\n[279 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n storage stations had occurred in Kansas, in two of which gasoline tanks had exploded, in one case striking and burning a building 475 feet away, killing 9 people, wounding 26 more, and burning several other houses. His findings show that within an even smaller radius from petitioners' tanks, or within the same or adjacent blocks, there are many buildings, including residences, a hotel, warehouses, and garages, some of wooden structure, and gasoline and kerosene storage tanks of 75,000-gallon capacity, and that the principal business street of the town is within two blocks of the Standard tanks. From local conditions a d recent public improvements the master found it reasonable to conclude that there would be increased residential building in the vicinity.\n The objection which petitioners make to the storage of gasoline and kerosene in tanks buried underground is that through the effect of electrolysis and corrosion caused by acid in the soil, and the possible 'floating out' of the tanks, leaks are likely to occur, difficult to discover, by which the gasoline might penetrate through the earth into sewers, wells, and basements, contaminating the water and causing explosions. But the master found that conditions which produce electrolysis are not present in the city of Marysville; that only a slight percentage of acid was found in the soil there, and, although there was more chance of corrosion of metal underground at the Standard Oil property than at the Sinclair tanks, it might take a term of years for it to take place. The findings also show that tanks already placed underground in the vicinity in compliance with the ordinance, and which it appeared had been in successful operation for more than two years, had not 'floated out' during periods of heavy rainfall, and the danger of floating could be overcome by proper drainage and by anchoring down the tanks; that the tanks buried \n\n[279 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n in compliance with the ordinance would rest on a level below the sewers; that there were no wells in the vicinity; and that the soil there had been shown by experiment to be impervious to gasoline. It was also found that the danger from fire or explosion due to lightning, which causes many fires in gasoline storage, and from static electricity, is less with underground than aboveground tanks, and that the base rate of insurance on storage tanks of gasoline and kerosene underground is 50 per cent. of that for tanks above.\n The facts that the tanks of petitioners within the city limits have been operated successfully aboveground; that appliances used by them are of the best type; that fires in connection with their many tanks located elsewhere have been relatively infrequent, and numerous others found by the master, were properly for the consideration of the city council in determining whether the ordinance should be enacted, but they fall far short of withdrawing the subject from legislative determination or establishing that the decision made was arbitrary or unreasonable. The passage of the ordinance was within the delegated powers of the city council, Cities Service Oil Co. v. Marysville, 117 Kan. 514, 231 P. 1031, 43 A. L. R. 854, and it acted within its constitutional province in dealing with the matter as one affecting public safety, Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, supra. From the facts as found it might, in the exercise of a reasonable judgment, have at least concluded that danger of ignition to the tanks placed underground, under the conditions prevailing at Marysville, was no greater than when placed aboveground, and that in the event of ignition the danger to life and property was very much less.\n We may not test in the balances of judicial review the weight and sufficiency of the facts to sustain the conclusion of the legislative body, nor may we set aside the ordinance because compliance with it is burdensome. Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 77\n, 35 S. Ct. 678; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, supra; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U. S. \n\n[279 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n 342, 36 S.

During that year the following section was added to article 16 or her Constitution:\n'Sec. 9. State Highway Construction. The provision of section 6 of article 16 of this Constitution prohibiting the state from engaging in any work of internal improvement unless authorized by a two-thirds vote of the people shall not apply to or affect the construction or improvement of public roads and highways; but the Legislature shall have power to provide for the construction and improvement of public roads and highways in whole or in part by the state, either directly or by extending aid to counties.'\n\n In 1919 the Legislature passed the State Highway Act, Session Laws 1919, c. 132, which directed:\n That there shall be a highway department, consisting of a commission of five members, and a superintendent. The 'commission shall have the power to sue in the name of the 'State Highway Commission of Wyoming,' and may be sued by such name in any court upon any contract, executed by it.' All roads, the cost of which is paid from the state highway fund, shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by the highway superintendent and shall be performed by or under \n\n[278 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n contracts approved and awarded by the commission. Except as otherwise specified 'construction and maintenance of all state highways, including all bridges, and culverts thereon, shall be performed at the expense of the state and by and under the supervision of the commission and the state highway superintendent.' A state highway fund is created, to be in the custody and keeping of the state treasurer, and payments therefrom shall be on warrants based upon vouchers by the highway superintendent.\n The original act was amended in 1927 (Laws 1927, c. 61) so as to provide: 'The commission shall have the power to sue in the name of the 'State Highway Commission of Wyoming,' and may be sued by such name in the courts of this state and in no other jurisdiction upon any contract executed by it.'\n By a contract dated June 1, 1922, 'between the state of Wyoming, acting through the state highway commission, and Utah Construction Company, a corporation, of Ogden, in the state of Utah, hereinafter called the contractor,' the parties undertook: That the contractor, at his own cost should do all work and furnish all labor, materials, and tools, 'except such as are mentioned in the specifications to be furnished by the state of Wyoming,' and construct a designated highway. 'The state of Wyoming shall pay and the contractor shall receive and accept as full compensation for everything furnished and done by the contractor under this contract and also for all loss or damage arising out of the nature of the work, the action of the elements or from any unforeseen contingencies or difficulties encountered in the prosecution of the work, the prices stipulated in the proposal.' 'Time shall be of the essence of this contract,' and for failure to complete the work as agreed 'damage will be sustained by the state of Wyoming; ... and it is therefore agreed that said contractor shall pay to the state of Wyoming, \n\n[278 U.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n as liquidated damages and not as penalty, an amount equal to the cost of maintaining the necessary force of engineers and inspectors on the work during the additional time; ... and the state highway commission may deduct the same from the amount due or to become due to the contractor . ...' 'The state of Wyoming hereby reserves the right to accept and make use of any portion of said work before the completion of the entire work without invalidating the contract or binding itself to accept the remainder of the work or any portion thereof whether completed or not.' The writing concluded thus: 'In witness whereof the state of Wyoming, acting through its state highway commission, party of the first part, has caused these presents to be executed by its superintendent and the seal thereof to be hereunto affixed.' It was signed 'State Highway Commission of Wyoming, by L. E. Laird, Superintendent,' and by the Utah Construction Company.\n A supplemental agreement dated December, 1922, and signed 'State Highway Commission of Wyoming, by L. E. Laird, Superintendent' and the Utah Construction Company, undertook to modify the contract of June 1, 1922, in certain material respects.\n By an amended petition, naming the Wyoming state highway commission and its individual members as defendants, filed in the United States District Court of Wyoming August 2, 1925, the Utah Construction Company sought to recover damages arising out of the breach of the above-described construction contract, as supplemented. Jurisdiction of the court was invoked under section 24 of the Judicial Code (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  41 ( 28 USCA  41)) on the ground of diverse citizenship of the parties. The petition alleges that the plaintiff is a citizen of Utah; the commission and its individual members are citizens of Wyoming; more than $3,000 is involved. \n\n[278 U.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n The District Court concluded that the suit, in effect, is one against the state; a state is not a citizen under the Judiciary Acts; there is no diversity of citizenship; and no jurisdiction.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that the proceeding is not really one against the state, and that the statute makes the highway commission a legal entity subject to suit. It accordingly reversed the District Court and directed that the cause be remanded.\n It seems to us sufficiently clear that the suit is, in effect, against the state of Wyoming. The contract for the construction of the work in question was between the Utah Construction Company and the state. The state acting through the highway commission, as it might through any officer, became a party to the original agreement and obligated herself thereby. Neither the commission nor any of its members assumed any direct or personal responsibility. The supplemental agreement was not intended to impose liability where there was none before. Its purpose, considering the changed circumstances, was to modify in the ways specified what the original parties had undertaken to do. The commission was but the arm or alter ego of the state, with no funds or ability to respond in damages. There is no claim that the members of the commission are personally liable.

And, under the Judiciary Acts of the United States, it is well settled that a suit between a state and a citizen or a corporation of another state is not between citizens of different states; and that the Circuit Court of the United States has no jurisdiction of it, unless it arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.'

Ct. 598.\n Here the petition showed no diversity of citizenship between the real parties in interest-the state and the construction company. No other ground of jurisdiction was asserted. Consequently there was no jurisdiction. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed; that of the District Court will be affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ALABAMA v. U.

The ground of the Commission's order was that the maintenance of such intrastate rates on a lower basis than those found reasonable would result in unjust discrimination against, and undue prejudice to persons and localities in, interstate commerce.\n The order of the Commission is within its general powers, Houston & Texas Ry. v.

The case is still pending in the court below for final hearing, and the present appeal relates only to the interlocutory order.\n Congress has manifested its solicitude that the power to grant writs of injunction against orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be exercised with special care, by requiring the consideration of applications to be made by three judges and by giving an appeal directly to this court both in the case of interlocutory orders and final decrees. Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 672\n, 47 S. Ct. 222. But there is nothing in the legislation to suggest that in the exercise of the judicial power in respect of such writs pertinent principles of equity, as theretofore understood, are to be disregarded or modified. It is well \n\n[279 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n established doctrine that an application for an interlocutory injunction is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court; and that an order either granting or denying such an injunction will not be disturbed by an appellate court unless the discretion was improvidently exercised.

The master gave full hearings and filed and submitted his report November 23, 1927, to which the complainants duly lodged exceptions, which have been elaborately argued.\n When these bills were filed, there was pending in this court an appeal by the Sanitary District of Chicago from a decree granted at the suit of the United States by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, against a diversion from the lake in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute, or 4,167 cubic feet per second. This amount had been permitted by the Secretary of War. In January, 1925, this court affirmed the \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 400]\n\u00a0\n decree, without prejudice to the granting of a further permit by the Secretary of War according to law. \n266 \nU.S. 405\n, 45 S. Ct. 176. On March 3, 1925, the Secretary of War after that decree enlarged the permit for a diversion not to exceed an annual average of 8,500 cubic feet per second, upon certain conditions hereafter to be noted.\n The amended bills herein averred that the Chicago diversion had lowered the levels of Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, their connecting waterways, and of the St. Lawrence river above tidewater, not less than six inches, to the serious injury of the complainant states, their citizens, and property owners; that the acts of the defendants had never been authorized by Congress, but were violations of the rights of the complainant states and their people; that the withdrawals of the water from Lake Michigan were for the purpose of taking care of the sewage of Chicago, and were not justified by any control Congress had attempted to exercise or could exercise in interstate commerce over the waters of Lake Michigan; and that the withdrawals were in palpable violation of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1121). The bills prayed that the defendants be enjoined from permanently diverting water from Lake Michigan or from dumping or draining sewage into its waterways which would render them unsanitary or obstruct the people of the complainant states in navigating them.\n The state of Illinois filed a demurrer to the bills and the Sanitary District of Chicago an answer, which included a motion to dismiss. The states of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana, by leave of court, became intervening codefendants, on the same side as Illinois, and moved to dismiss the bills. The demurrer of Illinois was overruled, and the motions to dismiss were denied, without prejudice. Thereupon the intervening defendants and the defendants the Sanitary District and the state of Illinois filed their respective answers. The states of \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 401]\n\u00a0\n Mississippi and Arkansas were also permitted to intervene as defendants, and adopted the answers of the other interveners. The answers of the defendants denied the injuries alleged, and averred that authority was given for the diversion under the acts of the Legislature of Illinois and under acts of Congress and permits of the Secretary of War authorized by Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce. All the answers stressed the point that the diversion of water from Lake Michigan improved the navigation of the Mississippi river and was an aid to the commerce of the Mississippi Valley and sought the preservation of this aid. They also set up the defense of laches, acquiescence and estoppel, on the ground that the purposes of the canal and the diversion were known to the people and the officials of the complainant states, and that no protest or complaint had been made in their behalf prior to the filing of the original bills herein.\n The master has made a comprehensive review of the evidence before him in regard to the history of the canal, the extent and effect of the diversion, the action of the state and federal governments, the plans for the disposal of the sewage and waste of Chicago and the other territory within the Sanitary District, as well as the character and feasibility of works proposed as a means of compensating for the lowering of lake levels. From this review we shall take what will assist us in the consideration of the issues deemed necessary to be considered on the exceptions to the report.\n We shall first consider in brief the parts taken by Congress and the state of Illinois and their respective agencies in the construction of the Sanitary District Canal and the creation of the Lake Michigan diversion.\n By the Act of March 30, 1822, c. 14; 3 Stat. 659, Congress authorized Illinois to survey and mark, through the public lands of the United States, the route of a canal connecting the Illinois river with Lake Michigan, and \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 402]\n\u00a0\n granted certain lands in aid of the project. A further land grant was made in 1827. The canal was completed in 1848. The canal crossed the continental divide between the Chicago and Des Plaines rivers, on a summit level 8 feet above the lake, and then paralleled the Des Plaines river and the Upper Illinois river to La Salle, Ill., where it entered the latter stream. The summit of the canal was supplied with water by pumps located in a plant on the Chicago river. Originally, only enough water was pumped to answer the needs of navigation in the canal, but thereafter, in 1861, the Legislature provided for improvement in the canal by excavation and a larger flow of water from Lake Michigan.\n Before 1865, the Chicago river, being a sluggish stream in its lower reaches, had become so offensive, because of receiving the sewage of the rapidly growing city, that for its immediate relief the municipal authorities and the canal commissioners agreed to pump water from the river in excess of the needs of navigation. By 1872 the summit level of the canal had been lowered, and it was hoped that this would result in a permanent flow of lake water through the south branch of the Chicago river, sufficient to keep it in good condition, but the plan failed, and the canal again became grossly polluted.\n In 1881, the Illinois Legislature passed a resolution authorizing the installation of pumps at the northern terminus of the canal, with a capacity of not less than 1,000 cubic feet a second, to draw water from Lake Michigan through the Chicago river and the canal. Pumps were installed and pumping was begun in 1883. For a few years this afforded sufficient dilution in the canal because of the high stage of Lake Michigan, but in 1886 the lake level began to fall, and continued to fall until 1891, when it was two feet lower than when the pumps were installed. Their capacity was thus reduced to a little more than 600 cubic feet a second. The nuisance \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 403]\n\u00a0\n along the canal continued to grow. The drainage and water supply commission of the state recommended, as the most economical method for meeting the requirement, a discharge into the Des Plaines river through a canal across the continental divide, providing a waterway of such dimensions as would furnish ample dilution. The commission pointed out that the proposed canal would, from its necessary dimensions and its regular discharge, produce a magnificent waterway between Chicago and the Mississippi river, suitable for navigation of boats having as much as 2, 000 tons burden, and would give also large water power of great commercial value to the state.\n The Sanitary District was organized under the Illinois act of 1889 ( Laws 1889, p. 125). It was completed in 1890. It embraced an area of 185 square miles. By later acts it was increased to approximately 438 square miles, extending from the Illinois state line on the south and east to the northern boundary of Cook county on the north, with about 34 miles of frontage on Lake Michigan, embracing the metropolitan area of Chicago, consisting of a total of 54 cities, towns, and villages.\n The main drainage canal was begun in 1892, and was opened in January, 1900. Since that time the flow of the Chicago river has been reversed; that is, it has been made to flow away from Lake Michigan toward the Mississippi. As originally constructed, the canal ended in a nonnavigable tail race. There was no lock at the southwestern end. But by the Act of May 14, 1903 (Laws 1903, p. 113), the Illinois Legislature gave the Sanitary District the power to construct dams, water wheels, and other works appropriate to render available the power arising from the water passing through the main channel and any auxiliary channels thereafter constructed.\n In 1908, the Constitution of Illinois was amended to authorize the Legislature to provide for the construction of \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 404]\n\u00a0\n a deep waterway or canal, from the water power plant of the Sanitary District of Chicago, at or near Lockport, to a point on the Illinois river at or near Utica, and to provide that this power might be leased for the benefit of the state treasury. Meantime, all the sewage in the drainage district, including Evanston, was turned into the main channel, and the water directly abstracted from Lake Michigan by the Sanitary District was increased from 2,541 cubic feet a second in 1900 to 5,751 in 1909, to 7, 228 in 1916 to 6,888 cubic feet a second in 1926, not including pumpage.\n The Sanitary District authorities have expended in the construction of works for sewage and the deep waterway canal $109,021,613, including interest on bonds.\n In 1888, Congress directed the Secretary of War to make surveys for a channel improvement in the Illinois and Des Plaines rivers. In 1892, Congress appropriated $72,000 to complete the improvement of the harbor at Chicago, and again $25,000 in 1894. Three engineers appointed by the Secretary of War reported to him that a diversion of 10,000 cubic feet a second through the Sanitary and Ship Canal would lower the levels of the lakes, except Lake Superior. In 1896, Congress appropriated money for dredging the Chicago river. The Sanitary District in that year asked for a permit from the Secretary of War to enlarge the cross-section of the Chicago river, and announced that the work had progressed so far that this must be done to make available the artificial channel under construction from Robey street, Chicago, to Lockport, 28 miles distant. The Secretary of War granted the permit, but said that this authority was not to be interpreted as an approval of the plans of the Sanitary District of Chicago to introduce a current into the Chicago river; that the United States should not be put to any expense, and that the authority was to expire by limitation in 2 years. Other permits relating to the same \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 405]\n\u00a0\n subject were issued by the same officer in 1897, 1898, and twice in 1899. The act of Congress of 1899 amplified the provisions of an earlier act of 1890 (26 Stat. 452) looking to the regulation, prevention, and removal by federal authority of obstructions to navigation and alteration of capacity of the navigable waters of the United States by enacting sections 9 and 10 thereof (33 USCA  401, 403).\n Other permits were allowed by the Secretary of War-one on December 5, 1901, allowing a diversion of 250,000 cubic feet per minute throughout the full 24 hours of each day. And in another instance on January 17, 1903, a diversion of 350,000 cubic feet per minute until March 31, 1903, was permitted, in order to carry off the accumulations of sewage deposit lining the shores along the city, with the provision that after that, the flow should be reduced to 250,000 cubic feet per minute as required by the permit of December, 1901. The Board of Engineers in 1905 reported to Congress that the effect upon the level of Lake Michigan of withdrawing 10, 000 cubic feet per second for an indefinite period had been the subject of elaborate investigation, and that the conclusion reached was that the final effect would be to lower the level of the lake six inches.\n An application for the flow of more water through the Calumet Sag Channel was declined by the Chief of Engineers, and was refused by the Secretary of War in March, 1907, and as the Sanitary District apparently intended to proceed with the work for which a permit had been refused, the United States brought suit in 1908 to prevent its construction and prevent the increase of the flow. Another application was refused by the Secretary of War in January, 1913, and there seems to have been another denied later.\n A second bill to enjoin the Sanitary District from a diversion of more than 250,000 cubic feet per minute or its \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 406]\n\u00a0\n equivalent 4,167 cubic feet a second of water from Lake Michigan was filed and was consolidated with the earlier suit, and after a long delay of 6 or 7 years an oral opinion was given by Judge Landis of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in favor of the Government. A decree not having been entered before Judge Landis resigned, a decree was entered by Judge Carpenter in the case, which was affirmed by this court in January, 1925. Sanitary District of Chicago v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405\n, 45 S. Ct. 176.\n This court's decree provided that the defendant, the Sanitary District of Chicago, its agents, and all other persons acting or claiming or assuming to act under its authority, should be enjoined from diverting or abstracting any waters from Lake Michigan over and above or in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per minute, to go into effect in 60 days, without prejudice to any permit that might be issued by the Secretary of War according to law.\n Immediately after this decision, the Sanitary District applied to the Secretary of War for permission to divert 10,000 cubic feet a second. The exigency was set out in the petition. The Secretary of War then issued a permit on March 3, 1925, which recited that the instrument did not give any property rights either in real estate or material, or any exclusive privileges, and that it did not authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights, or any infringement of federal, state, or local laws or regulations, or obviate the necessity of obtaining the state's assent to the work authorized. It certified that upon the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, the Secretary of War, under section 10 of the act of 1899 (33 USCA  403), authorized the Sanitary District to divert from Lake Michigan an amount of water not to exceed an annual average of 8,500 cubic feet per second, the instantaneous maximum not to exceed 11,000 cubic feet per second, upon certain conditions. \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 407]\n\u00a0\n The conditions of the permit require the city of Chicago to take immediate steps to carry out sewage treatment by artificial processes, so that before the expiration of the permit they should provide the equivalent of 100 per cent. treatment of the sewage of 1,200,000 people, or one-third of the population of the city, and that this should be done under supervision of the United States District Engineer at Chicago, the permit to be revoked if the conditions were not complied with, and the permit to cease unless renewed on December 31, 1929. In granting the permit, the Secretary of War expressed the opinion that steps should be taken to complete the entire work of providing for disposal of all the sewage in 10 years. Colonel Schultz, United States District Engineer at Chicago, reported that the conditions of the March 3, 1925, permit have been complied with, and the master confirms this in his report.\n In providing for the improvement of the channel of the Illinois river in the Act of January 21, 1927, c. 47; 44 Stat. 1013, Congress declared that nothing in the act should be construed as authority for any diversion from Lake Michigan.\n The master's findings on the subject of injury to the complainants are in effect as follows:\n The diversion which has taken place through the Chicago Drainage Canal has been substantially equivalent to a diversion of about 8,500 cubic feet a second for a period of time, sufficient to cause, and it has caused, the lowering of the mean levels of the lakes and the connecting waterways, as follows: Lakes Michigan and Huron approximately 6 inches; Lakes Erie and Ontario approximately 5 inches; and of the connecting rivers, bays, and harbors to the same extent respectively. A diversion of an additional 1,500 cubic feet per second, or a total diversion of 10,000 cubic feet a second, would cause an additional lowering in Lakes Michigan and Huron of about one inch, and in Lakes Erie and Ontario a little less than one inch, with \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 408]\n\u00a0\n a corresponding additional lowering in the connecting waterways. The master also finds that, if the diversion at Chicago were ended, assuming that other diversions remained the same, the mean levels of the lakes and rivers affected by the Chicago drainage would be raised in the course of several years (about 5 years in the case of Lakes Michigan and Huron, and about 1 year in the case of Lakes Erie and Ontario) to the same extent as they had been lowered, respectively, by that diversion.\n The master finds that the damage due to the diversion at Chicago relates to navigation and commercial interests, to structures, to the convenience of summer resorts, to fishing and hunting grounds, to public parks and other enterprises, and to riparian property generally, but does not report that injury to agriculture is established. He says that the Great Lakes and their connecting channels form a natural highway for transportation, having a water surface of over 95,000 square miles, and a shore line of 8,300 miles, extending from Duluth-Superior, and from Chicago and Gary, to Montreal, at the head of deepdraft ocean navigation on the St. Lawrence; that there are approximately 400 harbors on the Great Lakes and connecting channels, of which about 100 have been improved by the federal government; that the latter improvements consist in the excavation and maintenance of channels from deep water in the lakes to the harbor entrances; that inner or local harbors are located inside of the federal channels, and the depths in the inner harbors have been obtained and are maintained at local expense; that inner harbors are necessary to afford practical navigation; that extensive and expensive loading, unloading, and other terminal facilities have been constructed in these various ports within the territory of the complainant states, on the Great Lakes, at local expense.\n The master's report says that the waterborne traffic on the Great Lakes for the year 1923 consisted of 81,466,902,000 ton-miles of water haul, and that consideration of \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 409]\n\u00a0\n individual loaded boats and of their respective dimensions shows that, if water had been available for an additional 6 inches of draft, the fleet could have handled for the year 3,346,000 tons more than was actually transported, or to put the matter in another light, the season's business could have been done with the elimination from service of about 30 freighters of the 2,000-3,000 ton class, and that the lost tonnage of the total through business of the Lakes for 1923, incident to a 6-inch deficiency of draft, exceeded 4,000,000 tons, and that the average water- haul rate for the year was 88 cents per ton.\n The great losses to which the complainant states and their citizens and their property owners have been subjected by the reductions of levels in the various lakes and rivers, except Lake Superior, are made apparent by these figures.\n The pleadings question the jurisdiction of this court and the sufficiency of the facts set forth in the bills to constitute a cause of action. These issues, although raised, are not pressed by the defendants and we concur with the master in his conclusion that they are met completely by our previous decisions. Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208\n, 21 S. Ct. 331; Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S. Ct. 268; Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S. Ct. 504; Sanitary District of Chicago v.

Cas. 488.\n The controversies have taken a very wide range. The exact issue is whether the state of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago by diverting 8,500 cubic feet from the waters of Lake Michigan have so injured the riparian and other rights of the complainant states bordering the Great Lakes and connecting streams by lowering their levels as \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 410]\n\u00a0\n to justify an injunction to stop this diversion and thus restore the normal levels. Defendants assert that such a diversion is the result of congressional action in the regulation of interstate commerce, that the injury, if any, resulting is damnum absque injuria to the complaining states. Those states reply that the regulation of interstate commerce under the Constitution does not authorize the transfer by Congress of any of the navigable capacity of the Great Lakes system of waters to the Mississippi basin, that is from one great watershed to another; second, that the transfer is contrary to the provision of the Constitution forbidding the preference of the ports of one state over those of another; and, third, that the injuries to the complainant states deprive them and their citizens and property owners of property without due process of law, and of the natural advantages of their position, contrary to their sovereign rights as members of the Union. If one of these issues is decided in favor of the complaining states, it ends the case in their favor, and the diversion must be enjoined. But in the view which we take respecting what actually has been done by Congress some of these objections need not be considered or passed upon.\n The complainants, even apart from their constitutional objections, contend that Congress has not, by statute or otherwise, authorized the Lake Michigan diversion, that it is therefore illegal, and that injuries by it to the complainant states and their people should be forbidden by decree of this court. The diversion of 8,500 cubic feet a second is now maintained under a permit of the Secretary of War of March 3, 1925, acting under section 10 of the act of 1899, which it is contended by the complainants vests no such authority in him. They claim that the diversion is based on a purpose not to regulate navigation of the lake, but merely to get rid of the sewage of Chicago; that this is a state purpose, not a federal function, and should be enjoined to save the rights of complainants. If the view \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 411]\n\u00a0\n urged by the complainants is right, the necessity for the use of the 8,500 cubic feet a second to save the health of the inhabitants of the Sanitary District will then present the problem of the power and discretion of a court of equity to moderate the strict and immediate rights of the parties complainant to a gradual one which will effect justice as rapidly as the situation permits. The framing of the decree will then require the careful consideration of the court.\n The complainants contend that Congress has given no authority for the diversion from Lake Michigan, even if it has power so to do by way of regulating interstate commerce. The defendants rely for this authority on the permit of the Secretary of War issued by him March 3, 1925, to the Sanitary District shortly after the decree of this court in the Sanitary District v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405\n, 45 S. Ct. 176. That decree forbade the diversion of the waters from Lake Michigan in excess of 4,167 cubic feet a second, but was made expressly without prejudice to any permit issued by the Secretary of War according to law. The complainants contend that the permit which allows a diversion of 8,500 cubic feet a second is not in regulation of interstate commerce, is not according to law and should be declared invalid.\n The defendants base their claim of congressional authority on section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425, 30 Stat. 1151:\n'That the creation of an obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity, of any of the waters of the United States is hereby prohibited; and it shall not be lawful to build or commence the building of any wharf, pier, dolphin, boom, weir, breakwater, bulkhead, jetty, or other structures in any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, navigable river, or other water of the United States, outside established harbor lines, or where no harbor lines have been established, except on \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 412]\n\u00a0\n plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War; and it shall not be lawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, lake, harbor of refuge, or inclosure within the limits of any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States, unless the work has been recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of War prior to beginning the same.'\n\n The policy carried out in the Act of March 3, 1899, had been begun in the Act of September 19, 1890, c. 907, 26 Stat. 454, 455. Sections 9 and 10 were the rearranged result of the provisions of sections 7 and 10 of the act of 1890. A new classification was made in sections 9 and 10 of the act of 1899, and substituted for section 10 of the act of 1890. The latter provided that the creation of any obstruction to navigable capacity was prohibited, unless 'affirmatively authorized by law' (33 USCA  403a), and this was changed so as to read 'affirmatively authorized by Congress.' 33 USCA  403. The change in the words of the first clause of section 10 was intended to make mere state authorization inadequate. Sanitary District v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405, 429\n, 45 S. Ct. 176; United States v. Bellingham Bay Boom Co., \n176 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S. Ct. 343. It was not intended to override the authority of the state to put its veto upon the placing of obstructing structures in navigable waters within a state, and both state and federal approval were made necessary in such case. Cummings v. Chicago, \n188 \nU.S. 410\n, 23 S. Ct. 472. The words 'affirmatively authorized by Congress' should be construed in the light of the administrative exigencies which prompted the delegation of authority in the succeeding clauses. Congress, having stated in section 9 as to what particular structures its specific consent should be required, intended to leave to the Secretary of War, acting on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, the \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 413]\n\u00a0\n determination of what should be approved and authorized in the classes of cases described in the second and third clauses of section 10. If the section were construed to require a special authorization by Congress whenever in any aspect it might be considered that there was an obstruction to navigable capacity, none of the undertakings specifically provided for in the second and third clauses of section 10 could safely be undertaken without a special authorization of Congress. We do not think this was intended. The Supreme Court of Maine, in Maine Water Co. v. Knickerbocker Steam Towage Co., 90 Me. 473, 59 A. 953, took the same general view in construction of the same section. It held that the broad words of the first clause of that section were not intended to limit the second and third clauses and that Congress' purpose was a direct prohibition of what was forbidden by them, except when affirmatively approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War. We concur in this view.\n The true intent of the act of Congress was that unreasonable obstructions to navigation and navigable capacity were to be prohibited, and, in the cases described in the second and third clauses of section 10, the Secretary of War, acting on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, was authorized to determine what in the particular cases constituted an unreasonable obstruction.\n This construction of section 10 is sustained by the uniform practice of the War Department for nearly 30 years. Nothing is more convincing in interpretation of a doubtful or ambiguous statute. United States v. Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 205\n, 46 S. Ct. 298; Swendig v. Washington Water Power Co., \n265 \nU.S. 322, 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 496; Kern River Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 147, 154\n, 42 S. Ct. 60; United States v. Burlington & Missouri River R. R., \n98 U.S. 334\n, 341; United States v. Hammers, \n221 \nU.S. 220, 228\n, 31 S. Ct. 593; Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Ct. 685\n\n\n The practice is shown by the opinion of the Acting Attorney General, transmitted to the Secretary of War. \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 414]\n\u00a0\n 34 Op. Attys. Gen. 410, 416. The Secretary of War acted on this view on May 8, 1899, about two months after the passage of the act. This was followed by the permits subsequently granted down to March 3, 1925. The fact that the Secretary of War acted on this view was made known to Congress by many reports.\n But it is said the construction thus favored would constitute it a delegation by Congress of legislative power and invalid. We do not think so. The determination of the amount that could be safely taken from the lake is one that is shown by the evidence to be a peculiarly expert question. It is such a question as this that is naturally within the executive function that can be deputed by Congress. Southern Pacific Co. v. Olympian Dredging Co., \n260 \nU.S. 205, 208\n, 43 S. Ct. 26; Sanitary District v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405, 428\n, 45 S. Ct. 176; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 693\n, 12 S. Ct. 495; Butterfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S.

United States, \n242 \nU.S. 409, 424\n, 37 S. Ct. 158; J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 407\n, 48 S. Ct. 348.\n The construction of section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, was settled by this court in the decision of the first Chicago Drainage Canal Case in \n266 \nU.S. 405, 429\n, 45 S. Ct. 176. The decision there reached and the decree entered cannot be sustained, except on the theory that the court decided, first, that Congress had exercised the power to prevent injury to the navigability of Lake Michigan and the other lakes and rivers in the Great Lakes watershed; and, second, that it could properly and validly confer the administrative function of passing on the issue of unlawful injury or otherwise on the Secretary of War, and that it had done so. To give any other interpretation would necessarily be at variance with our previous decision. \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 415]\n\u00a0\n It is further argued by complainants that while the power of Congress extends to the protection and improvement of navigation, it does not extend to its destruction or to the creation of obstructions to navigable capacity. This court has said that while Congress, in the exercise of its power, may adopt any means naving some positive relation to the control of navigation and not otherwise inconsistent with the Constitution (United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 62\n, 33 S. Ct. 667), it may not arbitrarily destroy or impair the rights of riparian owners by legislation which has no real or substantial relation to the control of navigation or appropriateness to that end (United States v. River Rouge Improvement Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 419\n, 46 S. Ct. 144; Port of Seattle v. Oregon & Washington R. R., \n255 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 41 S. Ct. 237).\n So complainants urge that the diversion here is for purposes of sanitation and development of power only, and therefore that it lies outside the power confided by Congress to the Secretary of War. The master says:\n'There is no doubt that the diversion is primarily for the purposes of sanitation. Whatever may be said as to the service of the diverted water in relation to a waterway to the Mississippi, or as to the possible benefit of its contribution to the navigation of that river at low water stages, it remains true that the disposition of Chicago's sewage has been the dominant factor in the promotion, maintenance and development of the enterprise by the state of Illinois and the Sanitary District. The purpose of utilizing the flow through the drainage canal to develop power is also undoubtedly present, although subordinated to the exigency of sanitation. So far as the diverted water is used for the development of power, the use is merely incidental. This court, in Sanitary District v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405, 424\n, 45 S. Ct. 176, in describing the channel, looked upon its interest to the Sanitary District 'primarily as a \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 416]\n\u00a0\n means to dispose of the sewage of Chicago,' although it was also 'an object of attention to the United States as opening water communication between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi and the Gulf.\"\n\n The master then considered whether there was any express authorization of the diversion now permitted, except under sections 9 and 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, already referred to. On this subject he said:\n'Consideration by Congress of the advisability of the proposed waterway from Lake Michigan to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, demands by Congress for surveys, plans and estimates, the establishment of project depths, and appropriations for specified purposes, did not in my opinion constitute direct authority for the diversion in question, however that diversion, or the diversion of some quantity of water from Lake Michigan, might fit into an ultimate plan.'\n\n This conclusion of the master is fully supported by reference to the already cited Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1927, declaring that nothing therein should authorize any Lake Michigan diversion.\n The master also says that appropriations for widening and deepening the Chicago river, and the co-operation with the Sanitary District for several years in that improvement, merely committed Congress to the work as thus actually prescribed, but did not go further, whatever the advantages of that work in connection with the purposes of the Sanitary District's canal.\n He then proceeds:\n'There is nothing in any of the acts of Congress upon which the defendants rely specifying any particular quantity of water which could be diverted and it could hardly be considered a reasonable contention that the acts of Congress justified any diversion of water from Lake Michigan that the state of Illinois and the Sanitary District might see fit to make. It is manifest that it was \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 417]\n\u00a0\n the view of the War Department that Congress had not acted directly and whatever the department did was subject to such action as Congress might take.'\n\n The continues:\n'This understanding that Congress has not yet acted directly so as to authorize the diversion in question has continued. It was in this view that the United States prosecuted its suit to decree in this court to enjoin the defendants from taking more water from Lake Michigan than the Secretary of War had allowed.'\n\n In this conclusion, which the court confirms, we are therefore remitted solely to the effect and operation of the permit of 1925 as authority for the maintenance of the diversion.\n The normal power of the Secretary of War under section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899, is to maintain the navigable capacity of Lake Michigan and not to restrict it or destroy it by diversions. This is what the Secretaries of War and the Chiefs of Engineers were trying to do in the interval between 1896 and 1907 and 1913, when the applications for 10,000 cubic feet a second were denied by the successive Secretaries, and in 1908 a suit was brought by the United States to enjoin a flow beyond 4,167 cubic feet a second. Then, pending the suit, the Sanitary District disobeyed the restriction of the Secretary of War's permit and increased the diversion to 8,500 cubic feet in order to dispose of the sewage of that district. Had an injunction then issued and been enforced, the port of Chicago almost immediately would have become practically unusable, because of the deposit of sewage without a sufficient flow of water through the canal to dilute the sewage and carry it away. In the nature of things it was not practicable to stop the deposit without substituting some other means of disposal. This situation gave rise to an exigency which the Secretary, in the interest of navigation and its protection, met by issuing a temporary \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 418]\n\u00a0\n permit intended to sanction for the time being a sufficient diversion to avoid interference with navigation in the port of Chicago. See New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 307\n, 308 S., 41 S. Ct. 492. The elimination and prevention of this interference was the sole justification for expanding the prior permit, the limitations of which had been disregarded by the Sanitary District. Merely to aid the district in disposing of its sewage was not a justification, considering the limited scope of the Secretary's authority. He could not make mere local sanitation a basis for a continuing diversion. Accordingly he made the permit of March 3, 1925, both temporary and conditional-temporary in that it was limited in duration and revocable at will, and conditional in that it was made to depend on the adoption and carrying out by the district of other plans for disposing of the sewage.\n It will be perceived that the interference which was the basis of the Secretary's permit, and which the latter was intended to eliminate, resulted directly from the failure of the Sanitary District to take care of its sewage in some way other than by promoting or continuing the existing diversion. It may be that some flow from the lake is necessary to keep up navigation in the Chicago river which really is part of the port of Chicago, but that amount is negligible as compared with 8,500 second feet now being diverted. Hence, beyond that negligible quantity, the validity of the Secretary's permit derives its support entirely from a situation produced by the Sanitary District in violation of the complainants' rights, and but for that support complainants might properly press for an immediate shutting down by injunction of the diversion, save any small part needed to maintain navigation in the river. In these circumstances we think they are entitled to a decree which will be effective in bringing that violation and the unwaranted part of the diversion to an end. But in keeping with the principles \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 419]\n\u00a0\n on which courts of equity condition their relief, and by way of avoiding any unnecessary hazard to the health of the people of that section, our decree should be so framed as to accord to the Sanitary District a reasonably practicable time within which to provide some other means of disposing of the sewage, reducing the diversion as the artificial disposition of the sewage increases from time to time, until it is entirely disposed of thereby, when there shall be a final, permanent, operative and effective injunction.\n It is very apparent from the report of the master and from the state legislation, that the Legislature of Illinois and the Sanitary District have for a long period been strongly insistent upon such a use of the waters of Lake Michigan as would dispose of the sewage of the district and incidentally furnish a navigable water route from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi basin, and that not until 1903 was the attention of the public, and especially of the district authorities, drawn to the fact that a diversion like that now used would lower the lake levels with injurious consequences to the Great Lakes navigation and to the complainant states. The Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers in 1907 refused a permit by which there would be more than 4,167 feet a second diverted. Advised that the district authorities proposed to ignore that limitation, the United States brought suit against the authorities of the district to enjoin any diversion in excess of that quantity, as fixed in an earlier permit. Another application for enlargement was made to Secretary of War Stimson in 1913 and was rejected. For several years, including the inexcusable delays made possible by the failure of the federal court in Chicago to render a decision in the suit brought by the United States, the district authorities have been maintaining the diversion of 8,500 cubic feet per second or more on the plea of preserving the health of the district. Putting this plea \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 420]\n\u00a0\n forward has tended materially to hamper and obstruct the remedy to which the complainants are entitled in vindication of their rights, riparian and other.\n The intervening states on the same side with Illinois, in seeking a recognition of asserted rights in the navigation of the Mississippi, have answered denying the rights of the complainants to an injunction. They really seek affirmatively to preserve the diversion from Lake Michigan in the interest of such navigation and interstate commerce though they have made no express prayer therefor. In our view of the permit of March 3, 1925, and in the absence of direct authority from Congress for a waterway from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi, they show no rightful interest in the maintenance of the diversion. Their motions to dismiss the bills are overruled, and, so far as their answer may suggest affirmative relief, it is denied.\n In increasing the diversion from 4,167 cubic feet a second to 8,500, the Sanitary District defied the authority of the national government resting in the Secretary of War. And in so far as the prior diversion was not for the purposes of maintaining navigation in the Chicago river it was without any legal basis, because made for an inadmissible purpose. It therefore is the duty of this court by an appropriate decree to compel the reduction of the diversion to a point where it rests on a legal basis, and thus to restore the navigable capacity of Lake Michigan to its proper level. The Sanitary District authorities, relying on the argument with reference to the health of its people, have much too long delayed the needed substitution of suitable sewage plants as a means of avoiding the diversion in the future. Therefore they cannot now complain if an immediately heavy burden is placed upon the district because of their attitude and course. The situation requires the district to devise proper methods for providing sufficient money and to construct and put in operation with all reasonable expedition adequate plants for the dis- \n\n[278 U.S. 367, 421]\n\u00a0\n position of the sewage through other means than the lake diversion.\n Though the restoration of just rights to the complainants will be gradual, instead of immediate, it must be continuous and as speedy as practicable, and must include everything that is essential to an effective project.\n The court expresses its obligation to the master for his useful, fair, and comprehensive report.\n To determine the practical measures needed to effect the object just stated and the period required for their completion there will be need for the examination of experts; and the appropriate provisions of the necessary decree will require careful consideration. For this reason, the case will be again referred to the master for a further examination into the questions indicated. He will be authorized and directed to hear witnesses presented by each of the parties, and to call witnesses of his own selection, should he deem it necessary to do so, and then with all convenient speed to make report of his conclusions and of a form of decree.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUTTER BUTTE CANAL CO. v.

The Sutter Butte Canal Company, a corporation of the state, petitioned for a review and the annulment of an order of the Railroad Commission designated as decision No. 16289, made on March 20, 1926, relating to water rates, the valuation of its property for rate-fixing purposes, the rate of return thereon and the modification and practical abrogation of certain continuous contracts for the furnishing of water held by it with a certain class of consumers.\n The history of the company as a public utility engaged in the business of appropriating water from the Feather river and selling and distributing it for irrigation purposes in Butte and Sutter counties, is set forth in Butte County Water Users' Association v. Railroad Commission, \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 132]\n\u00a0\n 185 Cal. 218, 196 P. 265, King v. Railroad Commission, 190 Cal. 321, 212 P. 200, and Live Oak Water Users' Association v. Railroad Commission, 192 Cal, 132, 219 P. 65, and \n269 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 149.\n The canal company is a public utility subjected by law to the power and direction of the state Railroad Commission and is in possession of a water right dedicated to the public use. Its consumers are divided into two classes-contract consumers and noncontract consumers. The water was originally furnished to the contract consumers under water right contracts, which were continuous supply contracts, whereby the consumer paid an initial amount, which varied somewhat, and agreed to pay a stipulated rate for irrigation water service each year thereafter upon the total acreage covered by the contract, and the company on its part agreed to furnish water as required for all of the acres covered thereby. Noncontract consumers, or applicants, pursuant to the order of the commission made In March, 1918, were served upon the basis only of applications for water made from year to year.\n In December, 1924, a decision numbered 14422, on application by the company, further increased the water rates over those allowed under a decision of 1922, and abolished the differential in rates which had theretofore existed between contract and noncontract consumers. It created what was called a stand-by or service charge of $1.25 per acre, payable by both classes, effective as to non-contract holders for all of their lands covered by their applications during such time as they should continue thereunder, and in any event for not less than three years, and to be continuously effective as to contract holders for all of the lands covered by their contracts: Provided that, if such contract holder did not desire to use in any year the whole or any part of said water to which he was entitled, and filed with the company on or before February 1st of that year notice in writing of what he did not desire in respect to the service of the water, he should then \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 133]\n\u00a0\n be obligated to pay in that year, and in each year thereafter, on or before February 1st thereof, the service charge of $1.25 per acre of the land for which no water was desired, as specified in the notice, and as to the remainder of his land he was to pay such retes or charges based upon the extent and character of the use of the water which he desired to use as were in effect.\n This, however, was not a satisfactory adjustment, as the commission ultimately determined, and in 1925 there was a completely new investigation by the commission of the rates, charges, classifications, contracts, rules, regulations, and service of the canal company in view of existing protests and dissatisfaction. This led to a hearing of all parties in interest covering the main question as to the jurisdiction of the commission under the California law to modify the obligations of the parties, not only by use of the rates, but by direct variation of the terms between the canal company and the owners of so-called continuous contracts, and also to a consideration of the fairness and equity of the rates to be fixed for the payment of water furnished by both contract and noncontract users and other details involved in a broad investigation.\n The proceedings resulting in decision No. 16289 modified the previous rules, so as to give each continuous contract holder the right, at his option, either (1) to obtain water under applications for so much of his land as he desired to irrigate, similarly with applicants generally who were not holders of continuous contracts; or (2) to obtain water under his continuous contract, provided that, if he so elected, he might still, by notifying petitioner that he did not desire to use in any year the whole or any of the water which he was so entitled to receive, and filing with the company on or before February 1st of that year notice in writing of what he did desire in respect to the nonservice of water, be obligated in that year, and in the next succeeding year thereafter, but for no further period in \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 134]\n\u00a0\n which said notice remained in effect, to pay, on or before February 1st thereof, the service charge of $1.25 per acre of the land for which no water was desired, as specified in said notice; or (3) to release himself from any obligation to pay any charges to petitioner under his continuous contract by giving notice that he did not desire any water for his land in any year, or to give notice or use the water.\n The substance of this was to release all contract consumers. The contracts might be retained at the election of the consumer, but the whole plan was really to get rid of the troublesome dual situation and to abolish all distinction between the two classes of consumers and put them on a parity, in order that there might be removed from controversy this source of friction and trouble. The commission said:\n'Rates fixed herein will, therefore, be on the basis that all service be charged for under a uniform schedule of rater and under application forms which will exclude any consideration of the continuous contract and preclude the making of charges for unirrigated lands under such contracts, as such.'\n\n In view of the finding of the Supreme Court that the record does not disclose any substantial evidence which would impeach the findings of the Railroad Commission upon the subject of a fair rate base and a proper return to the company, with which we agree, our decision will be limited to a consideration of the charge that the decision here under review is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by taking away from the company its contract rights and depriving it of payment to it for water service for all the lands which under the original contract the landowners were to pay for, whether the water was used or not.\n The case made on behalf of the commission and its decision is that there has been delegated by the state to the commission the regulation for the public benefit of the \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 135]\n\u00a0\n rates and revenue to be received by the public utility for the service it renders to the public, that included in such power of regulation is the modification and qualification of the original contracts held by the public utility corporation in this public service, that in being a public utility under the California Constitution it necessarily submits itself to the police power of the state for the benefit of the public, that the ordinary rules that apply to the protection of contracts as between private persons under the Constitution of the United States, or to the maintenance of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of property as between individuals, do not apply, but that by the acquisition of such contracts and property, knowing that the police power controls in their regulation, the owner holds them without the usual sanctions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution between individuals. This power is said to operate upon property and property rights, including contracts, to the extent necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and its exercise has been committed to the Railroad Commission in regulating the public utilities in California.\n The state Constitution of 1879 (article 14,  1) provides:\n'The use of all water now appropriated, or that may hereafter be appropriated, for sale, rental, or distribution, is hereby declared to be a public use, and subject to the regulation and control of the state, in the manner to be prescribed by law. ...'\n\n Article 12, by section 23, an amendment added in 1911 (see St. 1911, p. 2164), provides:\n'Every private corporation, and every individual or association of individuals, owning, operating, managing, or controlling any ... canal, pipe line, plant, or equipment, or any part of such ... canal, pipe line, plant or equipment within this state, ... for the production, generation, transmission, delivery or furnishing of heat, light, \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 136]\n\u00a0\n water or power ... to or for the public, ... is hereby declared to be a public utility subject to such control and regulation by the Railroad Commission as may be provided by the Legislature, and every class of private corporations, individuals, or associations of individuals hereafter declared by the Legislature to be public utilities shall likewise be subject to such control and regulation. The Railroad Commission shall have and exercise such power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate public utilities in the state of California, and to fix the rates to be charged for commodities furnished or services rendered by public utilities as shall be conferred upon it by the Legislature, and the right of the Legislature to confer powers upon the Railroad Commission respecting public utilities is hereby declared to be plenary and to be unlimited by any provision of this Constitution.'\n\n Section 67 of the Public Utilities Act, enacted in 1911 (St. Ex. Sess. 1911, p. 55), provides that the exercise of the power thus conferred upon the Railroad Commission is to be reviewed only by the Supreme Court, to determine whether the Commission has regularly pursued its authority, including a determination of whether the order or decision under review violates any right of the petitioner under the Constitution of the United States or of the state of California. The findings and conclusions of the commission on questions of fact shall be final and shall not be subject to review. Such questions of fact shall include ultimate facts and the findings and conclusions of the commission on reasonableness and discrimination. The commission and each party to the action or proceeding before the commission shall have the right to appear in the review proceeding, and upon the hearing the Supreme Court shall render judgment either affirming or setting aside the order or decision of the commission. Deering's Gen. Laws of 1923, p. 2734, Act 6386. \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 137]\n\u00a0\n Without now affirming or denying all that is claimed for them, we think that the above recited clauses from the Constitution and statute are sufficient to subject the contracts in question to the regulating action of the commission upheld by the decision under review.\n The power to increase charges for service had been twice exercised by the Railroad Commission at the behest of the canal company, and the times and terms of payment under the contracts had been changed by the same power, and so far as the petitioner was concerned, its privileges and emoluments under the contract had been greatly increased. So far as the consumer was concerned, the contract has slight, if any, benefit to him left in it. The consumer of water who came in last and who had no contract was really served with water upon less onerous terms than the contract consumer, and he might satisfy all demands made against him in three years, if not sooner, and be completely released. This the Supreme Court held was a discrimination. It decided that it was within the power of the commission to remove it. The only provision of the contract which had not been theretofore modified by the commission or the court was the one with respect to the duration of the contract. As the contract was necessarily made in view of the power of the commission to change its terms to avoid discrimination in dealing with the consumers of water of a public utility, it is very difficult to see why the situation may not be reduced to a uniform one under the power of the commission, if that body deems it equitable and fair to do so in the interest of the public. The record shows with much clearness the complicated situation that must continue unless the duration of the obligations of the so-called contract and noncontract consumers be made the same. This change would seem to be well within the police power, subject to which these contracts were made, and there is no such difference between the fixing of rates \n\n[279 U.S. 125, 138]\n\u00a0\n and the modification of the duration of a contract as would prevent the application of the police power to the one and not to the other. There are a number of authorities that leave no doubt that such an exercise of the police power under the Constitution of 1879 must be sustained. Limoneira Co. v. Railroad Commission, 174 Cal. 232, 237, 162 P. 1033; Law v. Railroad Commission, 184 Cal. 737, 740, 195 P. 423, 14 A. L. R. 249; In re Murray, 2 Cal. R. R. Comm. Dec. 465, 494; Sausalito v. Marin Water Co., 8 Cal. R. R. Comm. Dec. 252, 261. The same question was before the Supreme Court of the state of Washington in the case of Raymond Lumber Co. v. Raymond Light & Water Co., 92 Wash. 330, 159 P. 133, L. R. A. 1917C, 574. The power of the commission to abrogate the contract between a utility and its consumers was upheld. An admirable statement of the principle is to be found in Re Guilford Water Co.'s Service Rates, 118 Me. 367, 108 A. 446. The general principles supporting such an exercise of the police power under the Fourteenth Amendment is sustained in Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 671. In this case it was held that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states, which is analogous to the police power of the states in regulating public utilities, extended to rendering impossible enforcement of contracts made between carriers and shippers, although valid when made, because they were all made subject to the possibility that, even if valid when made, Congress might by exercising its power, render them invalid. That is exactly the situation presented here. Those who made these contracts for water made them subject to the power of the commission to change them for the benefit of the public, and that is all that has been done in this case by the commission's order. See also Manigault v. Suprings, \n199 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 26 S. Ct. 127; Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.

Ct. 131.\n At the bar counsel for the appellant expressed some anxiety lest the commission might not accept the interpretation put on the order in question by the Supreme Court of the state, and for that reason he asked that we interpret the order independently. But the decision of the Supreme Court of the state is conclusive on us as to the interpretation of the order, that being a state question; and counsel for the commission announced at the bar that the commission regarded that decision as binding on them. Thus it is apparent that an independent interpretation by us of the commission's order cannot and ought not to be attempted.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAFT v. BOWERS(1929)\nNo. 16\nArgued: October 9, 1928Decided: February 18, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry W. Taft and Clarence Castimore, both of New York City, for petitioners in No. 16.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hiram C. Todd, and Roger S.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, who are donees of stocks, seek to recover income taxes exacted because of advancement in the market value of those stocks while owned by the donors. The facts are not in dispute. Both causes must turn upon the effect of paragraph (2),  202, Revenue Act 1921 (chapter 136, \n\n[278 U.S. 470, 479]\n\u00a0\n 42 Stat. 227, 229), which prescribes the basis for estimating taxable gain when one disposes of property which came to him by gift. The records do not differ essentially and a statement of the material circumstances disclosed by No. 16 will suffice.\n During the calendar years 1921 and 1922 the father of petitioner, Elizabeth C. Taft, gave her certain shares of Nash Motors Company stock, then more valuable than when acquired by him. She sold them during 1923 for more than their market value when the gift was made.\n The United States demanded an income tax reckoned upon the difference between cost to the donor and price received by the donee. She paid accordingly and sued to recover the portion imposed because of the advance in value while the donor owned the stock. The right to tax the increase in value after the gift is not denied.\n Abstractly stated, this is the problem:\n In 1916 A purchased 100 shares of stock for $1,000, which he held until 1923 when their fair market value had become $2,000. He then gave them to B who sold them during the year 1923 for $5,000. The United States claim that under the Revenue Act of 1921 B must pay income tax upon $4,000, as realized profits. B maintains that only $3,000-the appreciation during her ownership-can be regarded as income; that the increase during the donor's ownership is not income assessable against her within intendment of the Sixteenth Amendment.\n The District Court ruled against the United States; the Circuit Court of Appeals held with them.\n Act of Congress approved November 23, 1921 (chapter 136, 42 Stat. 227, 229, 237)-\n'Sec. 202. (a) That the basis for ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from a sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, acquired after February 28, 1913, shall be the cost of such property; except that-\n\n'(1) ...\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 470, 480]\n\u00a0\n '(2) In the case of such property, acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, the basis shall be the same as that which it would have in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift. If the facts necessary to determine such basis are unknown to the donee, the Commissioner shall, if possible, obtain such facts from such donor or last preceding owner, or any other person cognizant thereof. If the Commissioner finds it impossible to obtain such facts, the basis shall be the value of such property as found by the Commissioner as of the date or approximate date at which, according to the best information the Commissioner is able to obtain, such property was acquired by such donor or last preceding owner. In the case of such property acquired by gift on or before December 31, 1920, the basis for ascertaining gain or loss from a sale or other disposition thereof shall be the fair market price or value of such property at the time of such acquisition.'\n'Sec. 213. That for the purposes of this title (except as otherwise provided in section 233) the term 'gross income'-\n\n'(a) Includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service ... or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. The amount of all such items ( except as provided in subdivision (e) of section 201) shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless, under methods of accounting permitted under subdivision (b) of section 212, any such amounts are to be properly accounted for as of a different period; but\n\n'(b) Does not include the following items, which shall be exempt from taxation under this title:\n\n'(1) ... (2) ... (3) The value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent (but the income from such property shall be included in gross income). ...' \n\n[278 U.S. 470, 481]\n\u00a0\n We think the manifest purpose of Congress expressed in paragraph (2 ),  202, supra, was to require the petitioner to pay the enacted tax.\n\n The only question subject to serious controversy is whether Congress had power to authorize the exaction.\n It is said that the gift became a capital asset of the donee to the extent of its value when received and, therefore, when disposed of by her no part of that value could be treated as taxable income in her hands.\n The Sixteenth Amendment provides:\n'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'\n\n Income is the thing which may be taxed-income from any source. The amendment does not attempt to define income or to designate how taxes may be laid thereon, or how they may be enforced.\n Under former decisions here the settled doctrine is that the Sixteenth Amendment confers no power upon Congress to define and tax as income without apportionment something which theretofore could not have been properly regarded as income.\n Also, this court has declared: \"Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,' provided it be understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets.' Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 193 (64 L. Ed. 521, 9 A. L. R. 1570). The 'gain derived from capital,' within the definition, is 'not a gain accruing to capital, nor a growth or increment of value in the investment, but a gain, a profit, something of exchangeable value proceeding from the property, severed from the capital however invested, and coming in, that is, received or drawn by the claimant for his separate use, benefit and disposal.' United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 169\n, 42 S. Ct. 63, 65 (66 L. Ed. 180). \n\n[278 U.S. 470, 482]\n\u00a0\n If, instead of giving the stock to petitioner, the donor had sold it at market value, the excess over the capital he invested (cost) would have been income therefrom and subject to taxation under the Sixteenth Amendment. He would have been obliged to share the realized gain with the United States. He held the stock-the investment-subject to the right of the sovereign to take part of any increase in its value when separated through sale or conversion and reduced to his possession. Could he, contrary to the express will of Congress, by mere gift enable another to hold this stock free from such right, deprive the sovereign of the possibility of taxing the appreciation when actually severed, and convert the entire property into a capital asset of the donee, who invested nothing, as though the latter had purchased at the market price? And after a still further enhancement of the property, could the donee make a second gift with like effect, etc.? We think not.\n In truth the stock represented only a single investment of capital- that made by the donor. And when through sale or conversion the increase was separated therefrom, it became income from that investment in the hands of the recipient subject to taxation according to the very words of the Sixteenth Amendment. By requiring the recipient of the entire increase to pay a part into the public treasury, Congress deprived her of no right and subjected her to no hardship. She accepted the gift with knowledge of the statute and, as to the property received, voluntarily assumed the position of her donor. When she sold the stock she actually got the original sum invested, plus the entire appreciation and out of the latter only was she called on to pay the tax demanded.\n The provision of the statute under consideration seems entirely appropriate for enforcing a general scheme of lawful taxation. To accept the view urged in behalf of petitioner undoubtedly would defeat, to some extent, the \n\n[278 U.S. 470, 483]\n\u00a0\n purpose of Congress to take part of all gain derived from capital investments. To prevent that result and insure enforcement of its proper policy, Congress had power to require that for purposes of taxation the donee should accept the position of the donor in respect of the thing received. And in so doing, it acted neither unreasonably nor arbitrarily.\n The power of Congress to require a succeeding owner, in respect of taxation, to assume the place of his predecessor is pointed out by United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 171\n, 42 S. Ct. 63, 66 (66 L. Ed. 180):\n'Where, as in this case, the dividend constitutes a distribution of profits accumulated during an extended period and bears a large proportion to the par value of the stock, if an investor happened to buy stock shortly before the dividend, paying a price enhanced by an estimate of the capital plus the surplus of the company, and after distribution of the surplus, with corresponding reduction in the intrinsic and market value of the shares, he were called upon to pay a tax upon the dividend received, it might look in his case like a tax upon his capital. But it is only apparently so. In buying at a price that reflected the accumulated profits, he of course acquired as a part of the valuable rights purchased the prospect of a dividend from the accumulations-bought 'dividend on,' as the phrase goes-and necessarily took subject to the burden of the income tax proper to be assessed against him by reason of the dividend if and when made. He simply stepped into the shoes, in this as in other respects, of the stockholder whose shares he acquired, and presumably the prospect of a dividend influenced the price paid, and was discounted by the prospect of an income tax to be paid thereon. In short, the question whether a dividend made out of company profits constitutes income of the stockholder is not affected by antecedent transfers of the stock from hand to hand.' \n\n[278 U.S. 470, 484]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in the Constitution which lends support to the theory that gain actually resulting from the increased value of capital can be treated as taxable income in the hands of the recipient only so far as the increase occurred while he owned the property. And Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 167\n, 45 S. Ct. 475, is to the contrary.\n\n The judgment below is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of these causes. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE POCKET VETO CASE(1929)\nNo. 565\nArgued: March 11, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 655, 657]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Sumners, of Dallas, Tex., for Judiciary Committee of House of Representatives, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 655, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether, under the second clause in section 7 of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, a bill which is passed by both Houses of Congress during the first regular session of a particular Congress and presented to the President less than ten days (Sundays excepted) before the adjournment of that session, but is neither signed by the President nor returned by him to the house in which it originated, becomes a law in like manner as if he had signed it.\n At the first session of the 69th Congress Senate Bill No. 3185, entitled 'An Act authorizing certain Indian tribes and bands, or any of them, residing in the State of Washington, to present their claims to the Court of Claims,' having been passed by both Houses of Congress and duly authenticated, was presented to the President on June 24, 1926. On July 3 the first session of the 69th Congress was adjourned, under a house concurrent resolution. \n1\n The Congress was not again in session until the commencement of the second session on the first Monday in December. \n2\n And neither House of Congress was in session on July 6-the tenth day after the bill had been presented to the President (Sundays excepted). \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 673]\n\u00a0\n The President neither signed the bill nor returned it to the Senate. And it was not published as a law.\n Taking the position that the bill had become a law without the signature of the President, the Okanogan and other Indian tribes residing in the State of Washington in March, 1927, filed a petition in the Court of Claims setting up certain claims in accordance with the terms of the bill. The United States demurred to the petition. The court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition, on the ground that under the provisions of the Constitution the bill had not become a law.\n In view of the public importance of the question presented we granted the petitioners a writ of certiorari. \n278 \nU.S. 597\n, 49 S. Ct. 186, 73 L. Ed. -. And for like reason, at the request of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, we granted Mr. Sumners, a member of that Committee, leave to appear as amicus curiae. He has aided us by a comprehensive and forcible presentation of arguments against the conclusion of the court below.\n The clause of the Constitution here in question reads as follows: 'Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not be shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. ... If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days ( Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like manner as if he had signed it, \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 674]\n\u00a0\n unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.' \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The specific question here presented is whether, within the meaning of the last sentence-which we have italicized-Congress by the adjournment on July 3 prevented the President from returning the bill within ten days, Sundays excepted, after it had been presented to him. If the adjournment did not prevent him from returning the bill within the prescribed time, it became a law without his signature; but, if the adjournment prevented him from so doing, it did not become a law. This is unquestioned.\n In support of the position that the adjournment did not prevent the President from returning the bill within the prescribed time, counsel for the petitioners and the amicus curiae urge that the only 'adjournment' which prevents the President from returning a bill within the prescribed time is the final adjournment of the Congress, terminating its legislative existence and making it impossible for the President to return the bill for its reconsideration; and that an adjournment of the first session of the Congress does not prevent the President from returning the bill within the prescribed time since the legislative existence of the Congress is not terminated, and he may within that time return the bill to the House in which it originated, although not then in session, by delivering it, with his objections, to the Secretary, Clerk, or other appropriate agent of that House, to be held by such agent \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 675]\n\u00a0\n and presented to the House when the Congress resumes its sitting at the next session-thereby enabling the Congress to proceed with the reconsideration of the bill as a part of the unfinished legislative business carried over from the first session. And it is also said, by counsel for the petitioners, that the 'ten days' allowed for the return of the bill, may be construed as meaning 'legislative days,' that is, days on which the Congress is in legislative session, and not calendar days, thereby enabling the President to return the bill within ten days, Sundays excepted, exclusive of all days on which the Congress was not in legislative session, even although, by reason of an adjournment, this period does not expire until after the Congress has resumed its legislative sittings at the second session.\n In support of the position that Congress by the adjournment on July 3 prevented the president from returning the bill within the prescribed time, the Attorney General maintains that the word 'adjournment' includes an interim adjournment as well as the final adjournment at the end of a Congress; that the words 'ten days' mean calendar days, and not legislative days; that the President cannot return a bill with his objections to the House in which it originated except by returning it to the House while in session; that if, by reason of an adjournment taken by Congress within the prescribed time, the House in which the bill originated be not in session on the last of such days and the bill cannot be thus returned, the President is thereby prevented from returning the bill within the prescribed time; and that this view is supported by the practical construction given to the constitutional provision by the President through a long course of years, in which Congress has acquiesced.\n No light is thrown on the meaning of the constitutional provision in the proceedings and debates of the Constitutional Convention; and there has been no decision of \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 676]\n\u00a0\n this Court dealing directly with its meaning and effect in respect to the precise question here involved. And while we have been cited to various decisions of state courts construing similar provisions in state constitutions, an examination of them discloses such a conflict of opinion- due in some part to differences in phraseology or their application to the procedure of the state legislatures-that, viewed as a whole, they furnish no substantial aid in the determination of the question here presented and a detailed consideration of them here would not be helpful. For that reason we shall cite in this opinion only some that seem most apposite and persuasive in their reasoning.\n\n 1. \nIt is earnestly insisted by counsel for the petitioners and by the amicus curiae, as the underlying basis of their contentions, that since clause 2 gives the President merely a qualified negative over legislation and requires him, if he disapproves a bill, to return it with his objections to the House in which it originated so that Congress may have an opportunity to reconsider it in the light of such objections and pass it by a two-thirds vote of each House, the provision as to the return of a bill within a specified time is to be construed in a manner that will give effect to the reciprocal rights and duties of the President and of Congress and not enable him to defeat a bill of which he disapproves by a silent and 'absolute veto,' that is, a socalled 'pocket veto,' which neither discloses his objections nor gives Congress an opportunity to pass the bill over them. This argument involves a misconception of the reciprocal rights and duties of the President and of Congress and of the situation resulting from an adjournment of Congress which prevents the President from returning a bill with his objections within the specified time. This is illustrated in the use of the term 'pocket veto,' which does not accurately describe the situation, and is misleading in its implications in that it suggests that the \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 677]\n\u00a0\n failure of the bill in such case is necessarily due to the disapproval of the president and the intentional withholding of the bill from reconsideration. The Constitution in giving the President a qualified negative over legislation-commonly called a veto-entrusts him with an authority and imposes upon him an obligation that are of the highest importance, in the execution of which it is made his duty not only to sign bills that he approves in order that they may become law, but to return bills that he disapproves, with his objections, in order that they may be reconsidered by Congress. The faithful and effective exercise of this momentous duty necessarily requires time in which the President may carefully examine and consider a bill and determine, after due deliberation, whether he should approve or disapprove it, and if he disapproves it, formulate his objections for the consideration of Congress. To that end a specified time is given, after the bill has been presented to him, in which he may examine its provisions and either approve it or return it, not approved, for reconsideration. See La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423, 455\n, 50 S. Ct. 168.4 The power thus con- \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 678]\n\u00a0\n ferred upon the President cannot be narrowed or cut down by Congress, nor the time within which it is to be exercised lessened, directly or indirectly. \n5\n And it is just as essential a part of the constitutional provisions, guarding against ill-considered and unwise legislation, that the President, on his part, should have the full time allowed him for determining whether he should approve or disapprove a bill, and if disapproved, for adequately formulating the objections that should be considered by Congress, as it is that Congress, on its part, should have an opportunity to re-pass the bill over his objections.\n It will frequently happen-especially when many bills are presented to the President near the close of a session, some of which are complicated or deal with questions of great moment-that when Congress adjourns before the time allowed for his consideration and action has expired, he will not have been able to determine whether some of them should be approved or disapproved, or, if disapproved, to formulate adequately the objections which should receive the consideration of Congress. And it is plain that when the adjournment of Congress prevents the return of a bill within the allotted time, the failure of the bill to become a law cannot properly be ascribed to the disapproval of the President-who presumably would have returned it before the adjournment if there had been sufficient time in which to complete his consideration and \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 679]\n\u00a0\n take such action-but is attributable solely to the action of Congress in adjourning before the time allowed the President for returning the bill had expired. Thus, in La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, supra, 454 of 175 U. S. (20 S. Ct. 179), this Court said that 'if by its action, after the presentation of a bill to the President during the time given him by the Constitution for an examination of its provisions and for approving it by his signature, Congress puts it out of his power to return it, not approved, within that time to the House in which it originated, then the bill fails, and does not become a law.' \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nThere is plainly no warrant for adopting the suggestion of counsel for the petitioners-which is not urged by the amicus curiae-that the phrase 'within ten Days (Sundays excepted),' may be construed as meaning, not calendar days, but 'legislative days,' that is, days during which Congress is in legislative session-thereby excluding all calendar days which are not also legislative days from the computation of the period allowed the President for returning a bill. The words used in the Constitution are to be taken in their natural and obvious sense, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326, and are to be given the meaning they have in common use unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary. Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 139, 147\n, 6 S. Ct. 649. The word 'days,' when not qualified, means in ordinary and common usage calendar days. This is obviously the meaning in which it is used in the constitutional provision, and is emphasized by the fact that 'Sundays' are excepted. There is nothing whatever to justify changing this meaning by inserting the word 'legislative' as a qualifying adjective. And no President or Congress has ever suggested that the Pres- \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 680]\n\u00a0\n ident has ten 'legislative days' in which to consider and return a bill, or proceeded upon that theory.\n\n 3. \nNor can we agree with the argument that the word 'adjournment' as used in the constitutional provision refers only to the final adjournment of the Congress. The word 'adjournment' is not qualified by the word 'final'; and there is nothing in the context which warrants the insertion of such a limitation. On the contrary, the fact that the word 'adjournment' as used in the Constitution is not limited to a final adjournment, is shown by the first clause in section 5 of Article 1, which provides that a smaller number than a majority of each House may 'adjourn' from day to day, and by the fourth clause of the same Article, which provides that neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, 'adjourn' for more than three days. And the Standing Rules of the Senate refer specifically to motions to 'adjourn to a day certain' (No. XXII); and the Rules of the House of Representatives, to an 'adjournment' at the end of one session (No. XXVI). 7\n\n 4. \nWe think that under the constitutional provision the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed. It is clear, and, as \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 681]\n\u00a0\n we understand, is not questioned, that since the President may return a bill at any time within the allotted period, he is prevented from returning it, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, if by reason of the adjournment it is impossible for him to return it to the House in which it originated on the last day of that period. It is also conceded, as we understand, that the President is necessarily prevented from returning a bill by a final adjournment of the Congress, since such adjournment terminates the legislative existence of the Congress and makes it impossible to return the bill to either House. And the crucial question here presented is whether an interim adjournment of Congress at the end of the first session, as the result of which, although the legislative existence of the House in which the bill originated has not been terminated, it is not in session on the last day of the period allowed the President for returning the bill, likewise prevents him from returning it to such House. This brings us to the specific question whether, in order to return the bill to the House in which it originated, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, it is necessary, as the Attorney General insists, that it be returned to the House itself while it is in session, or whether, as urged by counsel for the petitioners and by the amicus curiae, it may be returned to the House, although not in session, by delivering it to an officer or agent of the House, to be held by him and delivered to the House when it resumes its sittings at the next session.\n Clause 2 specifically provides that if the President does not approve a bill 'he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.' That is, it provides in the same phrase and with no change in definition, that the 'House' to which the bill is to be returned is that which \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 682]\n\u00a0\n is to enter the objections on its journal and proceed to reconsider the bill.\n From a consideration of the entire clause we think that the 'House' to which the bill is to be returned, is the House in session. In Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n248 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 281 S., 283, 39 S. Ct. 93, 2 A. L. R. 1589), this Court, in holding that the provision in this clause requiring a vote of two-thirds of each House to pass a bill over the President's objections, means two-thirds of a quorum of each House and not two-thirds of all its members, said arguendo, that 'the context leaves no doubt that the provision was dealing with the two Houses as organized and entitled to exert legislative power,' that is, the legislative bodies 'organized conformably to law for the purpose of enacting legislation'; and, after stating that the identity between this provision and that in Article 5 of the Constitution, giving 'two-thirds of both Houses' the power to submit amendments, makes the practice as to one applicable to the other, quoted with approval the 'settled rule ... clearly and aptly stated' by the Speaker, Mr. Reed, in the House, on the passage of the amendment to the Constitution providing for the election of Senators by the vote of the people, as follows: 'What constitutes a House? A quorum of the membership, a majority, one-half and one more. That is all that is necessary to constitute a House to do all the business that comes before the House. Among the business that comes before the House is the reconsideration of a bill which has been vetoed by the President; another is a proposed amendment to the Constitution; and the practice is uniform in both cases that if a quorum of the House is present the House is constituted and two-thirds of those voting are sufficient in order to accomplish the object. ...'\n Since the bill is to be returned to the same 'House,' and none other, that is to enter the President's objections \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 683]\n\u00a0\n on its journal8 and proceed to reconsider the bill-there being only one and the same reference to such House-it follows, in our opinion, that under the constitutional mandate it is to be returned to the 'House' when sitting in an organized capacity for the transaction of business, and having authority to receive the return, enter the President's objections on its journal, and proceed to reconsider the bill; and that no return can be made to the House when it is not in session as a collective body and its members are dispersed. This is the view expressed in 1 Curtis' Constitutional History of the United States, 486, n. 1, in which it is said: 'This expression, a 'house', or 'each house,' is several times employed in the Constitution with reference to the faculties and powers of the two chambers respectively, and it always means, when so used, the constitutional quorum, assembled for the transaction of business, and capable of transacting business. This same expression was employed by the committee when they provided for the mode in which a bill, once rejected by the president, should be again brought before the legislative bodies. They directed it to be returned 'to that House in which it shall have originated'-that is to say, to a constitutional quorum, a majority of which passed it in the first instance. ...'\n This accords with the long established practice of both Houses of Congress to receive messages from the President while they are in session. See Senate Standing Rule XXVIII, cl. 1; House Rule XL; 5 Hind's Precedents of the House of Representatives, ch. CXXXVIII, especially sec. 6591, p. 812.\n We find no substantial basis for the suggestion that although the House in which the bill originated is not in session the bill may nevertheless be returned, con- \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 684]\n\u00a0\n sistently with the constitutional mandate, by delivering it, with the President's objections, to an officer or agent of the House, for subsequent delivery to the House when it resumes its sittings at the next session, with the same force and effect as if the bill had been returned to the House on the day when it was delivered to such officer or agent. Aside from the fact that Congress has never enacted any statute authorizing any officer or agent of either House to receive for it bills returned by the President during its adjournment, and that there is no rule to that effect in either House, the delivery of the bill to such officer or agent, even if authorized by Congress itself, would not comply with the constitutional mandate. The House, not having been in session when the bill was delivered to the officer or agent, could neither have received the bill and objections at that time, nor have entered the objections upon its journal, nor have proceeded to reconsider the bill, as the Constitution requires; and there is nothing in the Constitution which authorizes either House to make a nunc pro tunc record of the return of a bill as of a date on which it had not, in fact, been returned. Manifestly it was not intended that, instead of returning the bill to the House itself, as required by the constitutional provision, the President should be authorized to deliver it, during an adjournment of the House, to some individual officer or agent not authorized to make any legislative record of its delivery, who should hold it in his own hands for days, weeks or perhaps months,-not only leaving open possible questions as to the date on which it had been delivered to him, or whether it had in fact been delivered to him at all, but keeping the bill in the meantime in a state of suspended animation until the House resumes its sittings, with no certain knowledge on the part of the public as to whether it had or had not been seasonably delivered, and necessarily causing delay in its reconsideration which the Constitution evidently intended to avoid. In short, it was plainly the object \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 685]\n\u00a0\n of the constitutional provision that there should be a timely return of the bill, which should not only be a matter of official record definitely shown by the journal of the House itself, giving public, certain and prompt knowledge as to the status of the bill, but should enable Congress to proceed immediately with its reconsideration; and that the return of the bill should be an actual and public return to the House itself, and not a fictitious return by a delivery of the bill to some individual which could be given a retroactive effect at a later date when the time for the return of the bill to the House had expired.\n Thus Attorney General Devens in a memorandum to President Hayes, said: 'All these provisions indicate that in order to enable the President to return a bill the Houses should be in session; and if by their own act they see fit to adjourn and deprive him of the opportunity to return the bill, with his objections, and are not present themselves to receive and record these objections and to act thereon, the bill cannot become a law unless ten days shall have expired during which the President will have had the opportunity thus to return it. There is no suggestion that he may return it to the Speaker, or Clerk, or any officer of the House; but the return must be made to the House as an organized body.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It is significant that only one attempt has ever been made in Congress to authorize the President to return a bill when the House in which it originated was not in session; and that this failed. In 1868 a bill was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee for regulating the return of bills by the President. 10 While this specifically declared that the constitutional provision allowed the President ten calendar days ( Sundays excepted) in which to return a bill not approved by him, and that the return \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 686]\n\u00a0\n of a bill would be prevented by 'the final adjournment of a session' of Congress, although not by an adjournment to a particular day, it provided that if at any time within such ten days the President desired to return the bill to the house in which it originated when such house was not sitting, he might return it to the office of the Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House of Representatives, as the case might be, who should endorse thereon the day on which such return was made, and make an entry of the fact of such return in his journal of the proceedings, and that such return should be deemed a return of the bill to all intents and purposes. In the debate in the Senate strong opposition was expressed to this feature of the bill on constitutional grounds;11 and \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 687]\n\u00a0\n although it passed the Senate by a majority vote, it was never reported from the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, to which it was referred, and thus failed to pass the Congress. It does not appear that this suggestion has ever been renewed in Congress. \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 688]\n\u00a0\n 5. The views which we have expressed as to the construction and effect of the constitutional provision here in question are confirmed by the practical construction that has been given to it by the Presidents through a long \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 689]\n\u00a0\n course of years, in which Congress has acquiesced. Long settled and established practice is a consideration of great weight in a proper interpretation of constitutional provisions of this character. Compare Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 690]\n\u00a0\n Kansas, supra, 284 of 248 U. S. (39 S. Ct. 93); Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 119\n, 136 S., 47 S. Ct. 21; and State v. South Norwalk, 77 Conn. 257, 264, 58 A. 759, 761, in which the court said that a practice of at least twenty years duration 'on the part of the executive department, acquiesced in by the legislative department, while not absolutely binding on the judicial department, is entitled to great regard in determining the true construction of a constitutional provision the phraseology of which is in any respect of doubtful meaning.'\n A memorandum prepared in the office of the Attorney General showing the results of an exhaustive research of governmental archives for the purpose of disclosing the practical construction placed upon the constitutional provision here involved in reference to socalled 'pocket vetoes,' was transmitted by the President to Congress in December 1928,12 This memorandum-the accuracy of which is not questioned-cites more than 400 bills and resolutions which were passed by Congress and submitted to the President less than ten days before a final or interim adjournment of Congress, which were not signed by the President nor returned with his disapproval. Of these, 119 were instances in which the adjournment was that at the end of a session of Congress, as distinguished from the final adjournment of the Congress. None of these bills or resolutions were placed upon the statute books or treated as having become a law; nor does it appear that there was any attempt to enforce them in the courts until the present suit was brought. Of these instances 11 oc- \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 691]\n\u00a0\n curred before the end of President Lincoln's administration, and the remainder from the end of that administration to the present time. They arose under the administration of all the Presidents except ten. These 119 bills and resolutions are thus classified in the brief of the amicus curiae: Private relief bills, 36; pension bills, 19; obsolete purposes, 10; relating to District of Columbia, 9; relating to personal status, 8; right of way over Indian and government land, 8; river and harbor bills, 7; disposition of war stores and government property, 5; reduction of national debts, 3; and general legislation, 14. It does not appear that in any of these instances either House of Congress in any official manner questioned the validity and effect of the President's action in not returning the bill after the adjournment of the session, or proceeded on the theory that it had become a law, although neither signed nor returned, until the action was taken in the House Committee of the Whole in 1927 to which we have referred. \n13\n And in some instances new bills were introduced in place of those that had not been returned. Without analyzing these 119 instances in detail, we think they show that for a long series of years, commencing with President Madison's administration and continuing until the action of the House Committee of the Whole in 1927, all the Presidents who have had occasion to deal with this question have adopted and carried into effect the construction of the constitutional provision that they were prevented from returning the bill to the House in which it originated by the adjournment of the session of Congress; and that this construction has been acquiesced in by both Houses of Congress until 1927\n\n\n 6. For these reasons we conclude that the adjournment of the first session of the 69th Congress on July 3, 1926, prevented the President, within the meaning of the con- \n\n[279 U.S. 655, 692]\n\u00a0\n stitutional provision, from returning Senate Bill No. 3185 within ten days, Sundays excepted, after it had been presented to him, and that it did not become a law.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 67 Cong.

They supposed, as one of the means of best attaining this end that the executive of the State should not only be intrusted with the enforcement of all laws, but should also be vested with a voice in their adoption. In distributing the powers of government, they could, if they had chosen to do so, have authorized the general assembly to adopt laws independent of all executive action. But to prevent the evils of hasty, illy considered legislation, they conferred upon the governor the power to arrest the passage of a bill until his objections could be heard, and the bill be again considered and adopted. As the best means of accomplishing this, and of preventing the adoption of injurious measures, they gave to the governor ten days, exclusive of Sundays, in which to bestow that careful examination and consideration, so essentially necessary to determine the effects and consequences likely to flow from the adoption of a new measure. This is the duty imposed, and it is one that must be performed. And the time allowed for the purpose cannot be abridged, or the provision thwarted, by either accident or design. The use of the whole time given to the governor must be allowed. The Constitution has spoken and it must be obeyed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare Tuttle v. Boston, supra, 60 of 215 Mass. (102 N.

Rep't No. 2054, 69th Cong., 2d Sess.). This was followed by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole in overruling a point of order made against a provision in an appropriation bill that presented this question; and no appeal was taken from this ruling. 68 Cong.

It dispenses with the requisition of the Constitution that the bill shall be returned to the House, and directs that it be returned to the officer of the House, if the body is not in session. I do not believe it is competent for Congress to make any such change as that . ... Of course, if (the President) is to return the bill to the House, the House must be in session, because it is not a House unless in session in the sense in which the Constitution requires the bill to be returned to the House by the President with his objections. ... I think it is the duty of the President, in the plain language of the Constitution, to return the bill, not to the Secretary or Clerk of either House, but to the House itself. That is the unambiguous and plain language of the Constitution. ... It is returning it to the Senate or the House of Representatives in session, because when it is returned it is to be at once considered again. The Constitution contemplates that simultaneously with the return of the bill to the House in which it originated the House may take up the matter for consideration. ... I take the \n position that to return the bill to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, if it originated there, or to the Secretary of the Senate, if it originated in the Senate, when those bodies are not in session, is not a return of the bill to the House in which it originated. It is the duty and the right of the President to communicate to the House and not to a ministerial officer of the House. To enable him to communicate to the House it must necessarily be in session, because he cannot communicate with either House when it is in any other situation than in actual session. It must be assembled and in actual session. ... I think, sir, that the Executive may not only claim it as a right, but the House in which a bill originates may claim it as the performance of a duty by him to that House, and the people of the country may claim it as the performance of a duty by him, that he shall return the bill with his objections, not, in vacation, to the Clerk or to the Secretary of the Senate or House of Representatives, but to the body itself, and to enable him to perform that duty that body must necessarily be in session.' Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 2, pp. 1372, 1374, 1405.\n Senator Bayard said: 'But, Mr. President, there is an additional objection which to my mind is all powerful. The committee propose ... that if Congress is not in session during the ten days or at the end of the ten days the President may send the bill to the office of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives, according to the House in which the bill may have originated. There is no such provision in the Constitution; and the settled usage of this Government, without a single exception from its foundation, is that no communication is made by the Executive to either House except to the House in session, and that usage ought to have a controlling influence to exclude the idea which is contrained in the provision of the bill that I am now referring to. ... But further, the very object of the clause looks to the fact that the bill should be returned during the session of the House in which it originated. It looks, if I may so speak, to immediate action on the part of Congress-at all events it looks to giving to Congress the right of immediate action as soon as the objections of the President are received. The Houses are to proceed to consider the objections; they \n are to spread them at large on the Journal; there is to be a reconsideration of the measure formerly under debate. The whole clause looks to speedy action, at all events, upon objections made by the President, and the language employed providing for a return to the House does not imply filing a document with the Clerk or the Secretary when the House is not in session, whether it be the Senate or the House of Representatives. ... Here the usage of the Government of the United States, from its origin to the present day, is, that in no single case has a President of the United States, on the return of a bill to the Senate or House of Representatives, ever undertaken to file his message with the Clerk of the one or the Secretary of the other; but the action of the Executive has uniformly been by message sent to the House when in session. That is the settled usage; and when you look to the language of the Constitution, that the bill is to be returned to the House, it is certainly forcing language to say that a return to the House means filing a paper with the Secretary or Clerk when the House is not in session.' Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 2, pp. 1941, 1942.\n Senator Buckalew said: 'I should like to know how the Secretary can make entries and make up a Journal when the Senate is not in session. I can understand that when the Senate reconvenes the Clerk may hand to the President of the Senate, just as any member might or any outsider might, the particular paper, and it may then be presented to the Senate, and it may be entered in the Journal. But this bill contemplates that our Secretary shall make and keep a Journal when the Senate is not here at all, when there can be no Journal of its proceedings. ... (The) Constitution provides that the Senate shall keep a Journal of its proceedings, of what it does itself. In another clause it is provided that when the President returns a bill with his objections that message thus containing his objections shall be entered upon the Journal of the Senate. The fact of receiving such a message and the entry of the message upon the Journal must, in the very nature of the case, be when the Senate itself is in session. ... The Journal is to be kept by the Senate, and it is to be a Journal of what it does, a Journal of its proceedings. ... The reception of a message from the President of the United States is a proceeding by the Senate; it is an act by the Senate \n itself. ... I think, therefore, it is manifest that under the Constitution of the United States this Journal and the entries upon the Journal are matters which relate to a session of the Senate, an actual session, the personal presence of the body, and that it is not competent for the Senate to commit to one of its own officers, or to any officer of the Government, or to any citizen, the performance of a duty which is by the Constitution charged upon itself and to be performed by itself. ... Now, one objection which applies to the bill ... is that it is against the practice of the Government. From the time that Congress first convened together in 1789 down to this time it has been held, and held uniformly, that if the two Houses of Congress adjourned by a concurrent resolution before the expiration of ten days from the presentation of a bill to the President a bill which should then be left in his hands would fail. ... They have failed upon repeated occasions, not only during recent years, but far back in former times. ... This bill proposes, in the absence of both Houses of Congress to provide a substitute for the House to which the bill is to be returned. Instead of being returned to the House in which it originated, as the Constitution says, this bill proposes to enact that it shall be returned to the Secretary here alone ... and that upon the paper ... being given to that particular person it shall be considered that it has been returned to the House in which it originated. ... Can anything more flatly contradict common sense, deny the plain fact? Can we constitute our Secretary into the Senate, and can we make the Clerk of the House of Representatives the House for the purpose of doing any official act whatever? You propose that he shall receive the communication from the President as if he were the Senate or the House; that he, sitting anywhere, responsible to nobody, with no check upon him, shall make up a Journal as if he were the Senate or the House for the occasion.' Cong. Rec., 40th Cong., 2d. Sess., Pt. 3, pp. 2076, 2077.\n And Senator Morton said: 'The Constitution ... contemplates that the bill shall pass from the custody of the House in which it shall have originated; and we have no power, in my judgment, to say that it shall be sufficient to return \n it to the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House or to the Secretary or Clerk. ... What has become of the bill? The Constitution does not contemplate such a condition of things. ... It would be just as good for the private Secretary of the President to retain a bill as for the Secretary of the Senate; just as much a compliance with the provision of the Constitution; and it would be just as satisfactory to my mind for the President to retain it during the odd days as for the Secretary of the Senate to do so.'

(b), 40 Stat. 182, authorizing the President to modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition contracts for building, production, or purchase of ships or material, Shipping Board, to which President delegated his authority, had no authority to cancel contract between owner and charterer for carriage of freight, so as to entitle owners to compensation for loss from cancellation.\n Findings in suit for compensation, under Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, that Australian officials notified owner of vessel that Shipping Board had decided vessel would be ordered to abandon charome ore charter and return to United States for cargo of wheat, and that owners, without waiting for such order, signed wheat charter, did not show that the Shipping Board or the Emergency Fleet Corporation in fact canceled the chrome ore charter.\n Where owners of vessel, on being informed that Shipping Board had decided to order vessel to abandon its charter and carry a cargo of wheat, signed wheat charter with Food Administration Grain Corporation to prevent taking over of vessel by government, the Shipping Board did not requisition or take over the vessel, under Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, per. ( e), 40 Stat. 182, so as to entitle owners to compensation for loss from abandonment of the existing charter. Even if Shipping Board had ordered vessel to abandon charter and carry a cargo of wheat, this would not have been a placing of an order for the ship, within Act June 15, 1917, c. 29, par.

Their petition-which was based on the Emergency Shipping Fund section of the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 182, c. 29-alleged that in 1918 the United States Shipping Board, on behalf of the Government, made use of, requisitioned or took over the vessel from their service and business, for the use of the United States Grain Corporation in the transportation of wheat, and that 'by reason of being deprived of the use of said ship' they were entitled to compensation. The court, upon its findings of fact, awarded them judgment. Carver et al. v. United States, 64 Ct. Cl. 1.\n The Act of 1917 provided: 'The President is hereby authorized and empowered, within the limits of the amounts herein authorized-(a) To place an order with any person for such ships or material as the necessities of the Government, to be determined by the President, may require during the period of the war and which are of the nature, kind and quantity usually produced or capable of being produced by such person. (b) To modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material. ... (e) To purchase, requisition, or take over the title to, or the possession of, for use or operation by the United States any ship now constructed or in the process of construction or hereafter constructed, or any part thereof, or charter of such ship. Compliance with all orders issued hereunder shall be obligatory on any person to whom such order is given, and such order shall take precedence over all other orders and contracts placed with such person. \n\n[278 U.S. 294, 296]\n\u00a0\n ... Whenever the United States shall cancel, modify, suspend or requisition any contract, make use of, assume, occupy, requisition, acquire or take over any plant or part thereof, or any ship, charter, or material, in accordance with the provisions hereof, it shall make just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President. ... The President may exercise the power and authority hereby vested in him, ... through such agency or agencies as he shall determine from time to time . ... All ships constructed, purchased, or requisitioned under authority herein, ... shall be managed, operated, and disposed of as the President may direct.'\n By Executive Order of July 11, 1917, No. 2664, the President, by virtue of the authority vested in him by this Act, directed, among other things, 'that the United States Shipping Board shall have and exercise all power and authority vested in me in ... said act, in so far as applicable to and in furtherance of the taking over of title or possession, by purchase or requisition, of constructed vessels, or parts thereof, or charters therein; and the operation, management, and disposition of such vessels. ... The powers herein delegated to the United States Shipping Board may, in the discretion of said Board, be exercised directly by the said Board or by it through the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. ...'\n The findings show that in August, 1917, the respondents entered, simultaneously, into two separate charter parties with different companies: One providing for the transportation of lumber from British Columbia to Melbourne, Australia; and the other providing that the vessel on her return voyage should transport a cargo of chrome ore from New Caledonia to New York or Baltimore, at a stipulated rate which would yield $177,000. This return charter was approved by the United States Shipping Board. The vessel proceeded on her outward voyage, ar- \n\n[278 U.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n rived in Melbourne on March 9, 1918, discharged the cargo of lumber, and was ready to sail for New Caledonia on April 10. Meanwhile, on or about April 5, certain officials of the United States Shipping Board and War Industries Board and of the British and Australian Governments, had entered upon the discussion of requiring or requesting American-owned vessels, including the Betsy Ross, to return to an American port with cargoes of wheat; but owing to differences of opinion the discussion was continued until May 9. On April 5, the master of the vessel applied to the authorities at Melbourne for clearance papers; but they declined to grant clearance, advising the respondents' agent at Melbourne that this action was taken at the request of the United States Shipping Board, and on April 17 notified the respondents' agent that a cable had been received from the Secretary of State stating that the Shipping Board considered the vessel suitable for wheat and requested that she load wheat and not chrome ore. The respondents made various efforts to have the vessel cleared in order that she might carry out her chrome ore charter, but action on their requests was delayed until May 9, 'pending a decision being reached by the United States Shipping Board that the vessel would be ordered to abandon her chrome-ore charter and return to the United States with a cargo of wheat. ... Shortly after (the respondents) were so notified by said Australian officials,' the United States Food Administration Grain Corporation, at its office in New York, submitted to the managing owner of the vessel a charter party for the transportation of a cargo of wheat from Melbourne to New York, at a stipulated rate. The respondents, as the result of their negotiation with the Food Administration 'concluded that rather than have the United States Government take over' the vessel they 'had better sign said wheat charter'; and they did this on May 15. On her return voyage with the cargo \n\n[278 U.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n of wheat the vessel arrived in New York about the time of the armistice, and the respondents were paid by the Food Administration $63,784, at the rate provided in the charter. The respondents thereupon presented to the Shipping Board their claim for an award of compensation,1 which was disallowed in 1920. Thereafter the respondents brought this suit.\n In its opinion the Court of Claims said that the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation2 had required the respondents to take on a cargo of wheat for the return voyage to the United States, and by this act had cancelled the contract which the respondents had for transporting the cargo of chrome ore, and that under the Act of 1917 the Government was required to pay them just compensation for the loss which they incurred by such cancellation. And, having found that the just compensation for the cancellation of the chrome ore contract was $113,216, with interest from May 9, 1918, the respondents were given judgment for that amount.\n In our opinion the findings of fact do not sustain the judgment. Taking up the several contentions here made by the respondents under clauses (a), (b) and (e) of the Act of 1917, we reach the following conclusions:\n\n 1. \nThe Shipping Board had no authority under clause (b) of the Act and the power delegated to it by the President to cancel the respondents' contract for the shipment of chrome ore. While this clause authorized the President to cancel contracts 'for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material,' it gave no authority to cancel a contract for the carriage of freight. And the Act did not provide for compensation to the ship owners for the cancellation of such a contract. Furthermore, the find- \n\n[278 U.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n ings do not show that either the Shipping Board (or the Emergency Fleet Corporation) in fact cancelled this contract. The most that appears- construing the findings most favorably to the respondents-is that they were notified by the Australian officials that the Shipping Board had decided that the vessel 'would be ordered to abandon the chrome-ore charter and return to the United States with a cargo of wheat'; that thereupon the respondents, without waiting until the Shipping Board made such an order, concluded that it would be better to sign the wheat charter with the Grain Corporation rather than have the Government take over the vessel; and that by carrying out this wheat charter they themselves made it impossible to perform the chrome ore charter.\n\n 2. \nThere can be no recovery under clause (e) of the Act on the theory- upon which alone the respondents' petition was based-that the Shipping Board requisitioned or took over the vessel and deprived the respondents of its use. The findings not only fail to show any requisition or taking over of the vessel, but, on the contrary, show that it remained in the possession of the respondents and was used by them for their own benefit in carrying out the wheat charter which they made with the Grain Corporation for the very purpose of anticipating and preventing the taking over of the vessel by the Government. Compare American Smelting Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 75, 78\n, 42 S. Ct. 420 (66 L. Ed. 833).\n And even if the Shipping Board had in fact carried out its intention of ordering the vessel to abandon the chrome ore charter, and return to the United States with a cargo of wheat, this, plainly, would not have been the placing of 'an order' for the ship within the meaning of clause ( a) of the Act.\n\n 3. \nThe Shipping Board did not requisition the chrome ore charter under clause (e) of the Act. This would have \n\n[278 U.S. 294, 300]\n\u00a0\n required the Shipping Board to take over the charter itself for the transportation of chrome ore. This it did not do. The charter was not appropriated or kept alive for the use of the Government. See Omnia Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502, 513\n, 43 S. Ct. 437 (67 L. Ed. 773); Union Petroleum S. S. Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 752, 753.\n In short, the findings show no facts entitling the respondents to recover compensation from the United States under the provisions of the Act of 1917. And the judgment is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This was in accordance with a requirement of the Act of 1917. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] No reference whatever had been made to the Fleet Corporation in the findings of fact. \n\n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. GALVESTON, H & S A R CO(1929)\nNo. 440\nArgued: April 10, 1929Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 401, 402]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Herman J. Galloway, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Charles H. Bates, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Quartermaster Corps of the Army shipped on government bills of lading over the lines of respondent and connecting carriers a number of authorized private mounts of army officers ordered to change stations. Respondent was the last carrier, and presented bills based on tariff rates applicable for the transportation of private property. The charges have been paid less $475.17, withheld by the government on the ground that it is entitled to land grant deductions. This writ brings up for review a judgment of the Court of Claims for that amount.\n The question for decision is whether the United States is entitled to land grant rates for the transportation of such mounts.\n The United States concedes that it is liable for such transportation, but it insists that applicable statutory provisions and army regulations show that it has a property interest in the horses and the right to require the officers to use them in discharge of their duties, that they \n\n[279 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n are the property of the United States within the meaning of the land grant acts, and that therefore it is entitled to the reduced rates.\n Respondent was not aided by government land grant. Some of the carriers so aided are bound to transport 'property or troops of the United States' for less than commercial rates. \n1\n By what is known as the equalization agreement, railroad carriers, including respondent and its connections, severally agreed with the government to accept for transportation, where the government is entitled to reduced rates on lines so aided, the lowest rates available as derived through deductions on account of land grants from the regular tariff rates. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The authorized number of mounts for which maintenance is allowed to each officer is fixed by statute. \n3\n And that number is also authorized for the purpose of transportation. It is assumed, as stated in the briefs of the parties, that officers of and above the grade of major are required to furnish their own mounts. The government will furnish mounts and equipment for officers below that rank; but, if any such officer provides mounts for himself, he is allowed additional pay. \n4\n When the cost of transportation exceeds the sum allowed in army regulations, the Secretary of War may permit the purchase of such horses by the quartermaster. \n5\n And the Secretary may have the authorized mounts of an officer who dies in service transported at government expense from his last duty station to the home of his family; or such horses may be disposed of as directed by representa- \n\n[279 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n tives of the deceased. \n6\n The army regulations state that authorized mounts shall be transported at government expense 'provided the horses are owned by the officer, are intended to be used by him at his new station, and are suitable mounts.'\n The right of the United States to have the concessions and allowances in respect of transportation made by the carriers in consideration of the aid given is a continuing one. It is of great value to the government and of course correspondingly burdensome to the carriers. The terms of the obligation are to be sensibly and fairly read according to the words employed and not expanded or restricted by construction. When considering another question arising under a like provision in a land grant act, this court said: 'It might be very convenient for the government to have more rights than it has stipulated for; but we are on a question of construction, and on this question the usus loquendi is a far more valuable aid than the inquiry what might be desirable.' Lake Superior & Mississippi R. R. Co. v. United States, \n93 U.S. 442\n, 454.\n In Alabama Great Southern R. R. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cl. 522, it was held that when not actually in the service of the United States the men in the national guard of a state transported upon proper government requisition for participation by authority of the Secretary of War in the encampment, maneuvers and field instruction of a part of the regular army are not 'troops of the United States.' And see United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 354\n, 39 S. Ct. 294. In Oregon- Washington R. R. & Nav. Co. v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 645, the court held that the effects, household goods, etc., and authorized mounts of army officers on change of stations are not government property within the purview of such acts. \n\n[279 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n And in Oregon Washington R. R. Co. v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 329, this court held that the presonal baggage of an officer is not property of the United States entitled to transportation at land grant rates.\n We are of opinion that the principle of these decisions is controlling here. The United States demands service from its army officers which requires the use of things furnished by them. But it does not own and, as between it and them, it does not claim to own, hold, or have any property rights in the uniforms, manuals, clothes, private mounts, or other things by them furnished and used in the service. It would be unreasonable to hold valid the government's claim of ownership asserted merely to secure land grant rates for the transportation of such mounts. The construction contended for is without support and cannot be sustained.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3, Act March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 773; section 5, Act July 25, 1866, 14 Stat. 240.

U. S. Code, title 7,  217 (7 USCA  217). The American Livestock Association and others seek an injunction against the carrying out of an order of the Secretary of Agriculture requiring them to discontinue a boycott by which they refused dealings with the Producers Commission Association at the Oklahoma National Stock Yards. A district Court of three judges granted the injunction. 28 F.(2d) 63. The United States appealed.\n The secretary found the existence of the boycott, the persistent refusal to buy or sell live stock from or to the Producers Commission Association, and that the American Livestock Association and its fellow conspirators thereby restrained commerce and discriminated unfairly against the Producers Commission Association contrary \n\n[279 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n to the statute. The appellees urge that there is nothing to prevent their dealing or refusing to deal with whom they choose. But we think that it does not need argument to show that a boycott of a dealer in a stockyard may be an unfair practice under the Act as it is found to have been in this case. Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Association v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788. We pass at once to the only real question in debate.\n The Producers Commission Association is a cooperative association for mutual help under the laws of Oklahoma and is forbidden to 'handle the agricultural or horticultural product of any non-member except for storage.' It is agreed that 'the record contains no evidence as to whether the live stock which the Producers Commission Association bought or sold or attempted to buy or sell upon the Oklahoma City Stockyards was or was not the live stock of its members.' It is said so far as appears all the sales were ultra vires and that the appellees should not be enjoined from refusing to cooperate in an illegal act. But apart from the presumption that the corporation was acting only within its powers and from the burden resting on the doer of a prima facie illegal act, the boycott, to justify it, we agree with the Government that it would be absurd to suppose that a cooperative society organized for the special purpose of aiding its members should confine its business to the illegal sale of the products of non-members. If not all, we must assume that some at least of its business was legitimate and that to some extent it might sell live stock that its members produced. But the boycott was general, intended it would seem to drive the Producers Commission Association out of business. That association was a competitor of the appellees and the suggestion that it was acting ultra vires sounds like an afterthought and cannot be supposed to have been the motive for the act. It is said that motive does not matter, but motive may be very material when \n\n[279 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n it is sought to justify what until justified is a wrong. But whatever the motive nothing is shown or suggested by the evidence to justify the general boycott that the Secretary's order forbade. The Secretary's order should be enforced, but without prejudice to the right of the appellees to refuse to deal with the Producers Commission Association in matters beyond its power.\n A suggestion was made that the last named association was not within the protection of the Act of Congress. We see nothing in the limitation of its powers to prevent it, the statute seems to recognize it (section 306(f ); 7 USCA  207(f), and the corporation was found by the Secretary to be a market agency duly registered as such.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. EX REL. CLAUSSEN v. DAY(1929)\nNo. 416\nArgued: April 10, 1929Decided: May 13, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Silas B. Axtell and Charles A. Ellis, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is an alien held upon a warrant issued by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for deportation under section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917, U. S. C. tit. 8 (8 USCA  155. On his petition, the District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a writ of habeas corpus. Respondent made return and after a hearing the writ was dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n Section 19 contains the following: 'At any time within five years after entry, ... any alien who is hereafter sen- \n\n[279 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n tenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States, ... shall, upon warrant of the Secretary of Labor, he taken into custody and deported.'\n The facts are not in controversy. Petitioner is a native and subject of Denmark. He came to this country as a member of the crew of a British ship and landed at Norfolk January 22, 1912. He shipped the next day on an American schooner and subsequently served as a seaman on other American ships. October 19, 1917, he shipped from New York on the Elisha Atkins for a voyage to South America and return by way of Cuba; he landed at Boston, March 26, 1918. That was his last voyage from foreign ports to the United States. He was subsequently employed in American coastwise trade and resided for a time on land as representative of a seamen's labor union. In June, 1919, he petitioned for naturalization and declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States. June 17, 1921, in the Cumberland county court in the state of Maine, he pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter, the killing of James Walker at Portland on May 21, 1921, and was sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year. Subsequently a warrant of the Department of Labor was served upon him and after a hearing he was ordered to be deported to Denmark upon the termination of his imprisonment.\n The question for decision is whether petitioner was sentenced within five years after his entry into the United States.\n The provision extends to all aliens, that that is, every person not a native-born or naturalized citizen. Section 1; U. S. C. tit. 8 (8 USCA)  173. It is immaterial whether he was entitled to admission or whether he lawfully entered. The cause for which his deportation was ordered arose after entry. \n\n[279 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78, 91\n, 34 S. Ct. 196 (58 L. Ed. 515); Lewis v. Frick, \n233 \nU.S. 291\n, 34 S. Ct. 488. His declared purpose to naturalize does not serve him here as he had not become a citizen. If his landing at Boston in 1918 was an entry he is rightly held.\n Section 1 provides that 'United States,' as used in the act, shall be construed to mean the United States and any waters, territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, except the Isthmian Canal Zone. An entry into the United States is not effected by embarking on an American vessel in a foreign port. Such a vessel outside the United States whether on the high seas or in foreign waters is not a place included within the United States as defined by the act. See Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 101, 122\n, 43 S. Ct. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1306; Scharrenberg v. Dollar S. S. Co., \n245 \nU.S. 122, 127\n, 38 S. Ct. 28 (62 L. Ed. 189). The word 'entry' by its own force implies a coming from outside. The context shows that in order that there be an entry within the meaning of the act there must be an arrival from some foreign port or place. There is no such entry where one goes to sea on board an American vessel from a port of the United States and returns to the same or another port of this country without having been in any foreign port or place. See sections 19, 32, 33, 35 (8 USCA  155, 168, 169).\n And it is clear that petitioner departed from the United States on the Elisha Atkins and that, when he landed at Boston on his return from South American and Cuban ports, he made an entry into the United States within the meaning of the act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

The Commission at first expressed an opinion that it had 'authority to establish rates only for the future' but made orders establishing rates as fair and reasonable after the date of the orders. On further hearings however it made new orders establishing the same rates as fair and reasonable for the times between the filing of the applications and the orders previously made. In re Railway Mail Pay, 85 I. C. C. 157; Id., 95 I. C. C. 493. See Id., 144 I. C. C. 675. The railroads applied to the Postmaster General for payment as ordered by the Commission, but their applications were refused. Thereupon they sued in the Court of Claims and got judgments for compensation computed according to the last orders of the Commission. New York Cent. R. R. Co. v. U. S., 65 Ct. Cl. 115; Nevada County Narrow Gauge R. R. Co. v. U. S., 65 Ct. Cl. 327. The United States asked and obtained a writ of certiorari from this Court.\n The ground taken by the United States is that the Interstate Commerce Commission had been given no authority to change the rates of payment to be received by the railroads for any time before its orders went into effect. The question is one of construction which requires consideration not of a few words only but of the whole Act of Congress concerned. This is the Act of July 28, 1916, c. 261,  5, 39 Stat. 412, 425-431 (Code tit. 39, c. 15, 39 USCA  524-568, where the long section 5 is broken up into smaller \n\n[279 U.S. 73, 78]\n\u00a0\n sections) which made a great change in the relations between the railroads and the Government. Before that time the carriage of the mails by the railroads had been regarded as voluntary, New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 40 S. Ct. 67, now the service is required (Code, tit. 39,  541 (39 USCA  541)); refusal is punished by a fine of $1,000 a day (Code, tit. 39,  563 (39 USCA  563)), and the nature of the services to be rendered is described by the statute in great detail. Naturally, to save its constitutionality there is coupled with the requirement to transport a provision that the railroads shall receive reasonable compensation. The words are 'All railway common carriers are hereby required to transport such mail matter as may be offered for transportation by the United States in the manner, under the conditions, and with the service prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be entitled to receive fair and reasonable compensation for such transportation and for the service connected therewith.' 39 USCA  541. The Government admits, as it must, that reasonable compensation for such required services is a constitutional right. So far as the Government has waived its immunity from suit this right may be enforced in the absence of other remedies not only by injunction against further interference with it but by an action to recover compensation already due. Accordingly the statute provides for application from time to time to the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish by order a fair, reasonable rate or compensation to be paid at stated times. Code,  542, 551, 554 ( 39 USCA  542, 551, 554).\n We assume that while the railroads perform these services and accept pay without protest they get no ground for subsequent complaint. American Smelting & Refining Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 75, 78\n, 42 S. Ct. 420. But the filing of an application expresses a present dissatisfaction and a demand for more. A further protest would be a super- \n\n[279 U.S. 73, 79]\n\u00a0\n fluous formality. If the claim of the railroads is just they should be paid from the moment when the application is filed. In the often quoted words of Chief Justice Shaw, 'If a pie-powder court could be called on the instant and on the spot, the true rule of justice for the public would be, to pay the compensation with one hand, whilst they apply the axe with the other.' Parks v. Boston, 15 Pick. (Mass.) 198, 208. In fact the necessary investigation takes a long time, in these cases, years, but reasonable compensation for the years thus occupied is a constitutional right of the companies no less than it is for the future. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 43 S. Ct. 353. This being so, and the Interstate Commerce Commission being the tribunal to which the railroads are referred it is a natural incident of the jurisdiction that it should be free to treat its decision as made at once. Obviously Congress intended the Commission to settle the whole business, not to leave a straggling residuum to look out for itself, with possible danger to the validity of the Act. No reason can have existed for leaving the additional annoyance and expense of a suit for compensation during the time of the proceedings before the Commission, when the Commission has had that very question before it and has answered it at least from the date of its orders. We are quite aware that minutiae of expression may be found that show Congress to have been thinking of the future. We put our decision not on any specific phrase but on the reasonable implication of an authority to change the rates of pay which existed from the day when the application was filed, the manifest intent to refer all the rights of the railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the fact that unless the Commission has the power assumed a part of the railroads' constitutional rights will be left in the air.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED FUEL GAS CO. v.

Robert S. Spilman, of Charleston, W. Va., and George S. Wallace, of Huntington, W.

A part of its business is the sale of gas at wholesale to distributors, and is not regulated by any public body. Another part is the sale of gas direct to consumers in West Virginia cities, and is subject to regulation by the appellee commission. In April, 1924, appellant filed with the commission a schedule increasing its rates in its 'regulated' business in West Virginia. The commission, after an extensive hearing, denied this application for an increase, holding that the existing schedule yielded a fair return on appellant's property. P. S. C. W. Va. Bulletin, 91. Appellant then sought, by the present suit in the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, an injunction restraining the commission from interfering with appellant in putting into effect its new and higher rate schedule. Application for a preliminary injunction was heard by a court of three judges upon the record before the commission and some additional testimony, and was denied. 14 F.(2d) 209. The case is here by direct appeal from the order of the District Court, under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380).\n An earlier proceeding before the commission in 1917 had resulted in its order for an increase in the rate of 5 cents per 1,000 cubic feet which, in 1923, was set aside by the Supreme Court of West Virginia.

Railroad Comm. of Kentucky, 13 F.(2d) 510, coming here by appeal from a final decree of the District Court for Eastern Kentucky, involving similar and some additional questions and denying the relief asked, was heard with this, and is discussed in a separate opinion. \n278 \nU.S. 300\n, 49 S. Ct. 150, 73 L. Ed. -. The two cases involve substantially the same property and business. The issues as to valuation are identical, and, so far as material here, the records as to them are practically the same.\n Appellant, through ownership in fee and leases or contracts on a rental or royalty basis, controls the production \n\n[278 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n of natural gas from 814,910 acres of land. A part of this area, the so- termed 'proven' territory, is at present being used in production; the remainder being held in reserve as either 'probable' or 'unfavorable' sources of future production. Its principal items of property consist of its interest in this acreage, working capital, buildings, machinery, mains, pipes, compressors, and other equipment used in the production and distribution of gas.\n The value as claimed by appellant and as found by the commission and the court of the total property of appellant used in both its 'regulated' and 'unregulated' business, follows:\n Value claimed by appellant:\n As of Dec. 31, 1924 Physical property (production, transmission, and distribution systems, etc.) $22,274,274 00 Gas lands, leaseholds, and rights 36,449,176 00 General overhead charges 6,357,046 00 New property added during 1924 2,044,778 00 Working capital 990,000 00 Going concern value (difference between reproduction cost new and same less deterioration) 8,423,105 00 ___ $76,538,379 00\n Value as found by the commission: As of As of Dec. 31, 1923 Dec. 31, 1924 Physical property $25,000,000 00 $25,648,457 72 Working capital 990,000 00 990,000 00 Going concern value 3,000,000 00 3,000,000 00 Gas rights and leaseholds (book value) 6,343,329 67 6,361,511 42 ___ ___ 35,333,329 67 $35,999,969 14\n\n Value as found or assumed by the court below: As of Dec. 31, 1923 Physical property (production, transmission, and distribution systems, overhead, etc., less depreciation) $26,000,000 00 Going concern value 3,000,000 00 \n\n[278 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n Working capital 990,000 00\n Assumed value of gas reserve presently used and useful in the public service (\"proven\" territory) 10,317,311 39 ___ $40,307,311 39\n The court below made no finding as to the value of appellant's gas rights. It included in the rate base the 136,384 acres of land described by appellant's witnesses as proven territory (that is, areas which had been thoroughly tested and are now producing gas), and excluded 126,208 acres of land described as probable territory (that is, territory which had been partially tested or which appeared on the basis of geological evidence and its geographical relation to productive areas to be a probable source of natural gas). It was by this division of appellant's gas field and the inclusion of but a part in the rate base, at the full value claimed by appellant, that the court below reached its assumed valuation of the gas field of $10,317,311. The rest of the territory, consisting of 552,319 acres classified as improbable or unfavorable territory, was disregarded by the court below and appellant's own expert in estimating available gas supply.\n By allocating the various items of appellant's property to the regulated business, on the basis of percentages agreed upon by the parties, the court reached the conclusion that the following was the value of the property used and useful in the regulated business.\n Tangible property $ 7,530,826 00 Going concern value 847,350 00 Working capital 282,546 00 Gas reserve (proven territory only) 2,590,677 00 ___ $11,251,399 00\n The court further found that a reasonable rate of return on the property on the rate base was 12.77 per cent. (8 per cent. plus \n\n[278 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n 1.12 per cent. depreciation,1 plus 3.65 per cent. amortization). It found that the net earnings from the regulated business were $1,555,593 (before deduction for depreciation and amortization), and were sufficient to pay a return of 12.77 per cent. on more than the value as found, namely, on $12, 377,124.\n An order of a court of three judges denying an interlocutory injunction will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Chicago Great Western Ry. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 45 S. Ct. 55 (69 L. Ed. 183); and see Meccano, Limited, v. Wanamaker, \n253 U.S. 136\n, 141 40 S. Ct. 463 (64 L. Ed. 822). To support the burden resting upon it, appellant, while challenging generally the correctness of the court's valuation, places its chief reliance on the alleged erroneous valuation of its gas field. To support the claim to a much higher valuation, it relies upon the same theories and the same method of ascertaining the value of the gas field as were pressed upon us in No. 1. With respect to this item, after making the same assumptions as in that case, we reach the same conclusion, for reasons there stated at length, that there is no dependable evidence of value of appellant's gas field in excess of the value assumed on its books; that no ground is presented for assigning to it a value beyond the $6,343,329 so assumed on appellant's books, a smaller value than that used by the court in its calculations.\n With respect to other conclusions of the court below there is no serious suggestion that the court abused its discretion. In 1923 the case was before the highest court of the state. The estimates now presented to this court \n\n[278 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n are based on the business of that year, and we are without information as to appellant's business and return upon it in the intervening years. We think it clear that no case is presented which would warrant interference by this court with the order below denying interlocutory relief.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The commission had allowed this percentage amounting to $404,333 as covering depreciation of plant. The court merely allowed the total amount so found as plant depreciation, and did not estimate depreciation at a percentage of its own rate base, which was higher than that of the commission, the principal item of its valuation differing from that of the commission, being its assumed value of appellant's gas rights. \n\n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED FUEL GAS CO. v.

The case comes here on direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  345); the decree of the district court having been entered before the effective date of the Jurisdictional Act of February 13, 1925\n\n\n The case was argued here with No. 4, United Fuel Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm. of W. Va., \n278 \nU.S. 322\n, 49 S. Ct. 157, 73 L. Ed. -, decided this date, which involves some questions considered in the opinion in this case.\n Appellant United Fuel Gas Company, a West Virginia corporation, also appellant in No. 4, is engaged in the business of producing natural gas from gas fields located principally in West Virginia, which it sells to consumers in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. A part of its business is the sale of gas wholesale to distributors in West Virginia, and has not been subjected to regulation by any public body. Its local business in Kentucky is subjected to regulation by appellee. It formerly held franchises for the sale and distribution of gas in the Kentucky cities named all of which had expired by July, 1918. Neverthe less, it continued its service in those cities until June, 1923, when it organized appellant Warfield Natural Gas \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n Company, a Kentucky corporation, whose stock it owns and to which it conveyed its property in Kentucky, and which has since carried on its business of distributing gas in the cities named. The United Company then purported to withdraw from all its business in Kentucky by canceling appointments of agents to receive service of process within the state and by notifying the Secretary of State of its action.\n Before the organization of the Warfield Company, proceedings were had before the commission which resulted in its order directing a reduction of rates by the United Company to 80 per cent. of the former rate of 40 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, less 5 cents for prompt payment. Promptly on its organization, the Warfield Company filed with the commission a new rate schedule for the cities named of 45 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, with a reduction of 5 cents for punctual payment, and petitioned the commission to establish this rate as fair and reasonable or, in the alternative, to permit it to withdraw its service from those cities. After an extensive hearing, the commission denied the application, and construed its earlier order as requiring a rate of 28 cents (80 per cent. of 35 cents).\n The present suit was then brought in the District Court. That court construed the order of the commission as fixing a 32-cent rate, which it upheld and enjoined the commission from imposing any lower rate. From the latter part of the decree no appeal was taken.\n The present appeal challenges the constitutionality of the order of the commission, as construed by the court, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, both because the rate is confiscatory and because the order which, under the Kentucky Statutes, is not subject to judicial review, was not supported by findings of the commission. The validity of the order is also assailed on the further grounds that the part of it which required appellants to continue to render service violates the Ken- \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n tucky Constitution, and that the commission itself was never constitutionally created, and hence was without jurisdiction, because the legislative act establishing the commission and giving it its authority is in violation of section 51 of the Kentucky Constitution, which provides that no legislative act shall relate to more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.\n The District Court and this court, having jurisdiction of the cause since questions are raised under the Constitution of the United States, may pass on all questions of state law involved, Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378, 387\n, 46 S. Ct. 236 (70 L. Ed. 641 ), and must do so so far as they are necessary to a decision.\n Section 163 of the Kentucky Constitution provides that gas companies may not procure franchises permitting them to lay pipes in and under public streets without the consent of the appropriate municipal governing bodies, and section 164 limits all franchises to periods not exceeding 20 years. Section 23 of the Statutes of Kentucky, c. 61 (Acts of 1920, p. 250 ), subjects any public service company which has continued its service after the expiration of its franchise to the jurisdiction and authority of the Railroad Commission, and forbids it to withdraw such service without permission of the commission so long as it remains in business in any part of the state. It is said that the action of the commission under this statute in effect operates as a renewal of the franchise of appellants in the cities named in a manner not in conformity with the provisions of the State Constitution.\n But this objection, and that as well to the constitutionality, on state grounds, of the statute creating the commission and defining its powers, are not available to appellants in the present suit. It is the rule of this court, consistently applied, that one who has invoked action by state courts or authorities under state statutes may not later, when dissatisfied with the result, assail \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n their action on the theory that the statutes under which the action was taken offend against the Constitution of the United States. Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., \n244 \nU.S. 407\n, 37 S. Ct. 609; Electric Co. v. Dow, \n166 \nU.S. 489\n, 17 S. Ct. 645; Eustis v. Bolles, \n150 \nU.S. 361\n, 14 S. Ct. 131; Hurley v. Comm. of Fisheries, \n257 \nU.S. 223\n, 42 S. Ct. 83; St. Louis Malleable Casting Co. v. George C. Prendergast Co., \n260 \nU.S. 469\n, 43 S. Ct. 178. Upon like principle we think that appellants who have procured action by a state commission under a state statute may not assail that action in a federal court of equity on the ground that that statute, or the one creating the commission, is void under the State Constitution. Cf. Shepard v. Barron, \n194 \nU.S. 553\n, 24 S. Ct. 737. The sound discretion which controls the exercise of the extraordinary powers of a federal court of equity should not permit them to be exerted to relieve suitors on such a ground from the very action of state authorities which they have invoked.\n Assuming as we do for present purposes the authority of the commission under state law to refuse its permission to appellants to withdraw, we perceive no objection under the Federal Constitution, or otherwise, to withholding it. Appellants do not seriously deny that the Warfield Company is but an agency organized by the United Company for the purpose of carrying on its public service business in Kentucky or that through that agency the latter is doing business in the cities named and elsewhere in the state. In these circumstances its continuance in those cities is neither forbidden nor illegal. It remained subject to state regulation, and control of it is, by state statute, vested in the commission with state-wide authority. If a state may require a public service company subject to its control to make reasonable extensions of its service in order to satisfy a new or increased demand, present or anticipated, New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 \nU.S. 345\n, 38 S. Ct. 122; Woodhaven Gas Light Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n269 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 83; Missouri Pac. Ry. \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262\n, 30 S. Ct. 330; Wisconsin, etc ., R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287\n, 21 S. Ct. 115; Atlantic Coast Line v. No. Car. Corp'n Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 1\n, 27 S. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398; Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Ochs, \n249 \nU.S. 416\n, 39 S. Ct. 343, obviously the latter may be compelled to continue to use present facilities to supply an existing need so long as it continues to do business in the state.\n The primary duty of a public utility is to serve on reasonable terms all those who desire the service it renders. This duty does not permit it to pick and choose and to serve only those portions of the territory which it finds most profitable, leaving the remainder to get along without the service which it alone is in a position to give. An important purpose of state supervision is to prevent such discriminations, see New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, supra, at page 351 (38 S. Ct. 122), and, if a public service company may not refuse to serve a territory where the return is reasonable, or even in some circumstances where the return is inadequate but that on its total related business is sufficient, Atlantic Coast Line v. No. Car. Corp'n Comm., supra, at page 25 (27 S. Ct. 585); Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Kansas, supra, at page 277 (30 S. Ct. 330), it goes without saying that junction with the demand which it has created, as a weapon to control rates by threatening to discontinue that part of its service if it does not receive the rate demanded. The powers of the state, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, were not exceeded by the action of the commission, in compelling appellants to continue their service in the cities named so long as they continued to do business in other parts of the state, and to there avail of the extraordinary privileges extended to public utilities.\n The contentions also that the commission was not lawfully created under provisions of the State Constitution, and that its order was void because not supported by findings, have the same and no greater force than the \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 310]\n\u00a0\n objection that the rate is confiscatory. Suitors may not resort to a court of equity to restrain a threatened act merely because it is illegal or transcends constititional powers. They must show that the act complained of will inflict upon them some irreparable injury. As the court below held, appellants, as public service companies, are bound by the common law, if not by statute, to render their service at reasonable rates. If the rates are not shown to be confiscatory, they cannot complain that the order purporting to impose them was void, for they have suffered no injury even though the order was unauthorized. Cf. Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Dept. of Pub. Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 45 S. Ct. 412 (69 L. Ed. 836); Chicago, etc., Ry. v. Public Utilities Comm., \n274 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 47 S. Ct. 604 (71 L. Ed. 1085). We are thus brought to the question, chiefly argued and decisive of whole case, whether the rates complained of yield such a return upon the property used and useful in the public service as avoids confiscation.\n Gas is sold by the United Company to the Warfield Company at the state line at 30 cents per 1,000 cubic feet, but, in view of the history and intercorporate relations of the appellants, it is not contended that this contract rate is of any controlling significance in determining the propriety of the rate fixed by the commission. For this purpose appellants do not deny that they, with respect to their entire property and business, may be treated as a unit, and we so treat them. They contend here, as in No. 4, that all their property used and useful in producing the gas in West Virginia and elsewhere and in transporting and distributing it to consumers in the Kentucky cities should enter into the calculation of the rate base.\n Appellants, through ownership in fee and leases or contracts on a rental or royalty basis, control the production of natural gas from 814, 910 acres of land. A part of this area, the so-termed 'proven' territory, is at present being used in production; the remainder being \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 311]\n\u00a0\n held in reserve as either 'probable' or 'unfavorable' sources of future production. Their principal items of property consist of the interest in this acreage, working capital, buildings, machinery, mains, pipes, compressors, and other equipment used in the production and distribution of gas.\n The valuations of the entire business in the two states, made, respectively, by the appellants and the court below as of December 31, 1923, are as follows:\n Value claimed by appellants: Physical property $22,274,274 00 Gas lands, leaseholds, and rights 36,449,176 00 General overhead charges 6,357,046 00 Working capital 990,000 00 Going concern value 8,423,105 00 ___ \\ $74,493,601 00\n\n Value as found or assumed by the court below: Physical property $22,274,274 00 Gas lands, leases, and rights (book value) 6,732,920 00 Overheads 4,009,370 00 Working capital 999,000 00 Going concern value 3,000,000 00 ___ $37,015,564 00\n As will be observed, the difference in these estimates of value is due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds. Appellants, as will more fully appear, reached their claimed value by an estimate by experts of the profits to be derived from the sale, in an unregulated market, of the quantity of gas estimated to underlie the proven and probable areas. The court below found that the value of appellants' gas field did not exceed its 'book cost' which it took to be $6,732,920. This figure, however, included oil production acreage amounting to $389,591-leaving $6,343,329 as the book value of the entire gas field. \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 312]\n\u00a0\n Appellants contend that, for the purpose of ddetermining whether the rate is confiscatory, the regulated business in Kentucky must be separately considered, and it is immaterial whether or not a fair return is being made on the entire business, a part of which is unregulated. By taking the value of that property used exclusively in this regulated business and allocating the gas fields and other property used jointly in the two classes of business, the former on the basis of the volume of gas supplied to each type of business, appellants conclude that, if their valuation of their gas rights be accepted a compositive percentage of 11 per cent. of the total value is to be allocated to the regulated business. To establish that the rate is confiscatory, they accept the conclusions of the court below as to the value of all items of property except the gas lands and leases, and, substituting for that item their own minimum valuation of $30,000,000, they arrive at a hypothetical rate base for their entire property of $60,282,644. The value of the 11 per cent. of this property properly allocable to the regulated business in Kentucky is thus set at $6,631,091. This valuation, on the basis of 14 per cent. return (1 1\/2 per cent. depreciation, plus 4 1\/2 per cent. amortization, which items the court below deemed liberal, plus an 8 per cent. return), would thus entitle appellants to earn $867,309, substantially more than the actual earnings of the regulated business shown to be $749,839 in 1923 at the 32-cent rate. Appellants do not seriously question the sufficiency of the allowance for depreciation or the 8 per cent. return. The 4 1\/2 per cent. allowed for amortization, calculated on the rate base, is more than sufficient to replace appellants' entire property at the end of 18 years, the estimated life of the gas field.\n In assigning to their total property a value of $74,493,601, and in concluding that the prescribed rate is confiscatory because of its effect on the regulated business alone, appellants make certain assumptions, all of which are challenged. In the view which we take, and for presen- \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 313]\n\u00a0\n t purposes only, we likewise make those assumptions without determining their validity. They are (a) that in the case as presented present reproduction value of property used and useful in the business, if ascertainable, is to be taken as the rate base; (b) that, under the circumstances of this case, it is not enough that the return on appellants' business as a whole is remunerative, but earnings of the property used in or properly allocated to the Kentucky regulated business must be separately considered in ascertaining whether the rate is confiscatory; (c) that both proven and probable areas of appellants' gas acreage, whether shown to be presently productive or not, if acquired in a prudent administration of appellants' business, are to be included in the valuation for rate-amking purposes; (d) that depreciation and amortization are to be calculated on the basis of the present value of the property rather than upon the original cost or investment; (e) that, although entitled to earn a fair return on the present value of their gas leases, the 'delay rentals' paid upon them pending drilling and development are properly chargeable to operating expense.\n Making these assumptions, it is apparent that the disposition of the present question must turn, as appellants argue, principally upon the value to be assigned to the gas rights, although in certain aspects of the case a minor consideration may be the proportion of profits from the sale of gasoline extracted from the gas which should properly be included in the net earnings of the regulated business.\n The burden of proving the value of property on which they are constitutionally entitled to earn a fair return rests upon the appellants, and, to justify judicial interference with the action of state officers in fixing the rate assailed, must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 29 S. Ct. 148 ( 53 L. Ed. 371). Of the total of 814,910 acres embraced in the gas field, controlled by appellants or subsidiaries, 41,969 acres are owned in \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 314]\n\u00a0\n fee. The remainder is controlled by lease or contract. This acreage, although concededly well selected for purposes of economical development and avoiding loss of gas by drainage, is not in a solid block; rather it is in widely scattered areas; much of it lies adjacent to or is interspersed with gas fields controlled by others. Leases for fixed periods and so long after as gas is found in paying quantities have been obtained by appellants by payment of small bonus payments. The leases vary in their terms, but a typical lease gives the lessee the right to drill for gas for ten years, with the privilege of renewal at a fixed small annual delay rental, varying from 25 cents to $2 per acre, materially increased in the form either of a fixed rental or a royalty if and when production is established. They are customarily renewed from eighteen months to a year before expiration, and for renewal an additional bonus is paid.\n The actual cost on this basis of appellants' gas field is not shown, but it appears to have been substantially less than the book value assigned to it. It was stated on the argument that these leases, not only singly but in blocks, are sold in open market, but their market price appears not to have been established.\n Appellants do not accept either cost or market value as the basis of value of their gas rights. Instead they urge that their assembled holdings of gas rights are unique, in that they cannot be reproduced and that their value depends largely upon their peculiar nature and situation. They rest their claim to a largely enhanced value over book value upon alternative theories supported by two classes of expert testimony. Appellants' experts, on the basis of geological and mining engineering data, and especially by ascertaining the existing rock pressure of the gas in various pools and by comparing the rate of decrease of rock pressure with the amount of gas produced from these \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 315]\n\u00a0\n pools in the same period of time, arrived at an estimate of the total volume of gas underlying the proven and probable territory. The results reached by this method were checked by comparison with the actual experience in gas production from selected pools and wells. As a final outcome of these calculations it was estimated that there was underlying the 136,384 acres of proven territory and available for use 249,100,000, 000 cubic feet of gas, and in the 126,208 acres of probable territory 414, 600,000,000 cubic feet. With respect to the probable territory, there were no production or pressure records to aid the experts in the preparation of their estimate. In calculation the volume of gas in this area, they had recourse to comparison with the nearest pools in the same geological structure. This method was characterized by the witness using it as 'difficult and uncertain' and as 'much less trustworthy' than that applied to the proven territory.\n These calculations are supplemented by testimony that in Pittsburgh there is an unregulated market for natural gas used for industrial purposes at 35 cents per 1,000 cubic feet which would, on an estimated changing schedule of annual production, absorb in eighteen years the total estimated reserve of gas in appellant's gas field. At this price, natural gas, it was said, could compete successfully in Pittsburgh, for industrial purposes, with gas produced from soft coal at the prevailing price of $2. 75 a ton at the mine. After calculating the cost of getting this gas to the market, distant 130 miles from the nearest point on appellants' mains, providing for all construction costs including the cost of plant and transmission line, the gas when marketed, it was estimated, would pay a fair return upon investment, repay taxes and investment, and leave a balance, when discounted so as to give present value, of $32,458,129. A second witness, taking 30 cents as the market price of gas in Pittsburgh and deducting trans \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 316]\n\u00a0\n portation costs, concluded that the gas in the ground is worth 5 cents per 1,000 cubic feet and arrived at a higher value, $33,155,421. To this latter estimate he added the present estimated cost of acquiring the 552, 319 acres of improbable or unfavorable territory at $5.96 per acre, or $3, 293,754, making a total estimated present value of appellants' gas field of $36,449,176. In this connection there is evidence, which appears to be unchallenged, that the average cost of acquiring unoperated acreage during 1921 to 1923 was 83 cents per acre, and that in 1923 appellants acquired 15,184 acres at a cost of 66 cents per acre.\n Appellants' second class of expert testimony is that of men experienced and interested in the production and marketing of natural gas, who purported to assign to appellants' gas field what was described on the argument as its present exchange value or the price which the property would bring if sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer. Three such witnesses testified to a present value of appellants' gas field in amounts varying from $30,000,000 to $35,000,000, and a fourth fixed the value at $ 45,000,000. Examination of their testimony discloses that these estimates were not based on prevailing prices for gas leases or on actual sales, but, as in the case of the geological and engineering experts, upon an estimated or assumed exhaustible supply of gas available to appellants until exhausted, and upon a predictable price for natural gas in unregulated markets through a future period of about eighteen years. Common characteristics of both methods of valuation, therefore, are the estimation on uncertain bases of the volume of gas available and of the price at which it may be sold through a long future period.\n A point considered below and argued here is that gas in the earth is not capable of ownership, but we assume that appellants' leases and contracts give them complete legal power of control over the gas available beneath the surface of the area embraced in the gas field, so far as it may \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 317]\n\u00a0\n be brought under physical control. We assume also that the gas is now present in substantially the volume indicated, and we lay to one side the speculative character of the assumption that the gas in that volume, despite its fugitive character and its possible drainage into other fields not under appellants' control, will remain available for appropriation through the eighteen or more years required to exhaust the field.\n Waiving these not inconsiderable difficulties in the way of establishing value, we pass to another and more serious difficulty. In both methods of valuation, the value of property used in a business whose rates are regulated is made to depend on an assumed earning capacity and the data relied on to establish assumed earning capacity are themselves essentially speculative-so much so as to form no trustworthy basis for the computation of value.\n It is true that a part of appellants' business is not regulated at present, but it does not appear that the ultimate distribution of their product to consumers in other states will be immune from regulation either because of the interstate commerce clause, Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S. Ct. 279; Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236\n, 39 S. Ct. 268, or for other reasons, and there can be no reasonable assumption that it will be. The unique character of appellants' control over a natural product, limited in amount, asserted here as a basis of value, the obvious necessity of securing franchises or special privileges to enable them to distribute their product to consumers under the conditions assumed, and other circumstances which subject them to regulation in Kentucky and West Virginia, make inadmissible the assumption that the price to consumers would remain unregulated elsewhere.\n And in other respects the assumed earning capacity is so wanting in probative force as to require its rejection in the circumstances here disclosed. It rests on a predic- \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 318]\n\u00a0\n tion, feebly made, that the estimated amount of gas will be available as required through a period of eighteen years; that natural gas so transported and used as a fuel will command a price of from 30 to 35 cents per 1,000 cubic feet through that period in a market yet to be established despite the changes wrought by invention and improved business and manufacturing methods; and a further prediction not only of what plant and equipment must be constructed and maintained to effect delivery of the gas for this period to consumers in the city of Pittsburgh but also of the cost through a like period, of the construction, maintenance, and operation of that plant and equipment. Such predictions can only be made on the basis of data which are not and cannot be known, and most of which are in the highest degree speculative. Such a process of estimating value is without any known sanction.\n On the record as made, appellants have failed to present any convincing evidence of value of their gas field which would enable us to assign to it any greater value than that which they appear to have assigned to it on their books. This book value, therefore, may be accepted, not as evidence of the real value of the gas field, but as an assumed value named by the appellants, which, on the evidence presented cannot reasonably be fixed at any higher figure.\n We likewise find no persuasive ground for not accepting as substantially correct the amount of $30,282,644 fixed by the court below as the maximum value to be assigned to those items of appellants' property other than the gas reserve, rather than $38,044,425, appellants' outside figure for those items. But, to avoid unnecessary discussion of them in detail and for present purposes, appellants' valuation of all these items may be conceded to be correct. If we restate appellants' claimed valuation of their property by substituting for their estimate of the \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 319]\n\u00a0\n value of the gas rights their book value (after deduction for oil acreage) of $6,343,329, we arrive at a total assumed maximum valuation of appellants' entire property of $44,387,754. Taking 12 per cent. \n1\n of this total or $5,326.530 as the largest amount which could be allocated to the Kentucky business, a return upon it of 14 per cent. (8 per cent. plus 1 1\/2 per cent. depreciation, plus 4 1\/2 per cent. amortization) would amount to $745,714, an amount less than the actual return.\n Appellants also contend that the court below erroneously included in the earnings of the regulated business the sum of $65,166, or 50 per cent. of the net proceeds of the sale of gasoline extracted, before sale, from the gas sold in the regulated business, on the ground that this amount exceeded the profits from this branch of appellants' business as reflected on their books.\n In the process of extracting gasoline from natural gas, the gas flows from the field to the extraction plant, where the gasoline is taken out; the residual gas being returned to the transmission system for distribution to consumers. In the production of this gasoline, therefore, joint use is made of the gas, gas field, and certain facilities of the gas company. This joint use requires a prorating of joint investment and expenses and of the return from the joint \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 320]\n\u00a0\n enterprise. Formerly, appellant United Company maintained and operated its own gasoline extracting plant. The West Virginia Public Service Commission having held that 50 per cent. of the net return from the sale of gasoline should be credited to the gas business, the United Company organized a corporation, the Virginia Gasoline & Oil Company, and conveyed to it its gasoline extraction plant, receiving the stock of the new corporation in exchange. Later it turned over this stock to its own stockholders of which there are but two, both corporations, in the same proportions in which they held stock in the United Company. It entered into a contract with this subsidiary by which it receives one-eighth of the gross profit from the gasoline extracted. The commission and the Supreme Court of West Virginia, in City of Charleston v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 95 W. Va. 91, 120 S. E. 398, in which the United Company was a party, held that 50 per cent. was a fair share of the net return of the subsidiary's business attributable to appellant United Company, and this was the conclusion adopted by the court below.\n We need not labor the point that a public service corporation may not make a rate confiscatory by reducing its net earnings through the device of a contract unduly favoring a subsidiary or a corporation owned by its own stockholders. Cf. Chicago & Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S. Ct. 400 (36 L. Ed. 176). We recognize that a public service commission, under the guise of establishing a fair rate, may not usurp the functions of the company's directors and in every case substitute its judgment for theirs as to the propriety of contracts entered into by the utility; and common ownership is not of itself sufficient ground for disregarding such intercorporate agreements when it appears that, although an affiliated corporation may be receiving the larger share of the profits, the regulated company is still receiving substantial benefits from \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 321]\n\u00a0\n the contract and probably could not have secured better terms elsewhere. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S. Ct. 544 (67 L. Ed. 981, 31 A. L. R. 807); Houston v. Southwestern Telephone Co., \n259 \nU.S. 318\n, 42 S. Ct. 486.\n But this case is not of that class. It is not without significance that the West Virginia court in considering this question had before it previous findings of its commission, based upon actual contracts for gasoline extraction where the parties, dealing at arm's length, had agreed upon a 50 per cent. division. Credible evidence was introduce below tending to show that expenses on property used jointly by the two companies and properly allocable to the gasoline company had been borne by the gas companies to an amount in excess of the return received by them from the gasoline extraction. It likewise was shown, the evidence not being challenged by appellants, that the extracting company during the years 1917 to 1922 inclusive, after allowing appellants 50 per cent. of the net earnings for the extraction privilege, would have earned not less than 102 per cent. of its capital investment in each year. The average yearly profit during this period was 119.75 per cent. In 1923 its net return on this basis was 80.40 per cent. Making allowance for fiuctuation in market prices and other common business hazards, we do not think it would be difficult to induce capital to seek investment on the basis of this division of net carnings. In such circumstances we think no adequate reason is shown for not including in the appellants' earnings 50 per cent. of the net proceeds from the gasoline extraction.\n Appellants' computation of value and of earnings is assailed at many other points, but fully conceding, for present purposes only, every contention made by them except those which we have discussed, namely, the value of appellants' gas rights and the division of return from gasoline extraction, the appellants have failed to show \n\n[278 U.S. 300, 322]\n\u00a0\n that the rate imposed is confiscatory or otherwise such as to call for the interference of a court of equity.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Various witnesses allocated to the Kentucky regulated business an amount of property used for 'production' (including the gas field) varying from 7.1 per cent. to 10.49 per cent. and a percentage of property other than 'production' ranging from 9 per cent. to 12.07 per cent.-or for the entire property as a unit, from 8.4 per cent. to 11 per cent. No witness testified that there was a composite percentage which could be taken generally to represent the part of appellants' entire property used in the regulated business, regardless of the varying values assigned to different items of property. Appellants have used this last figure, 11 per cent., in their calculations, and do not contest its validity. This percentage appears to include some property located in Kentucky but not actually used in the local regulated business. In our own computation, we have, for convenience, taken 12 per cent. as the highest possible percentage applicable and as the figure most favorable to appellants. \n\n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES PRINT. & LITHO.

No interference with interstate or foreign commerce is alleged. The bill seeks an injunction against \n\n[279 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n printing and selling such labels for any groceries that the plaintiff sells. The trial court found that facts to be as above stated and the Supreme Court held that the 'purpose and effect of the (Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592,  16; 33 Stat. 728, (Code tit. 15,  96; 15 USCA  96)) was to project the trade mark rights of the registrant and owner thereof into all the states even in advance of the establishment of trade therein, and to afford full protection to such registrant and owner.' If affirmed a judgment for the plaintiff giving the relief prayed and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n In the Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, it was held that the earlier acts attempting to give these unlimited rights were beyond the power of Congress. Soon after that decision an Act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 502), gave remedies for the wrongful use of a registered trade mark in foreign commerce or commerce with Indian Tribes. It was said that obviously the Act was passed in view of the above-mentioned case, that only the trade-mark used in such commerce was admitted to registry and that the registered mark could only be infringed when used in that commerce. Warner v. Searle & Hereth Co., \n191 \nU.S. 195, 204\n, 24 S. Ct. 79 (see United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., \n248 \nU.S. 90, 99\n, 39 S. Ct. 48) and the constitutionality of the Act even when so limited was left open. \n191 U.S. 206\n (24 S. Ct. 79). The Act of 1905 goes a little farther and gives remedies against reproduction, etc., of the registered trade-mark 'in commerce among the several States' as well as in commerce with foreign nations, etc., section 16, supra. A remedy for such infringement was given in Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, \n233 \nU.S. 461\n, 34 S. Ct. 648. See also American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, \n262 \nU.S. 209\n, 43 S.

Ed. -, just decided, this case \n\n[279 U.S. 732, 733]\n\u00a0\n comes here by certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and on the following statement:\n'This action is brought by the Boston & Maine Railroad to recover income taxes for the year 1917, claimed to have been erroneously collected. In the District Court (for the District of Massachusetts) the plaintiff recovered a judgment for the full amount of its demand-$ 3,920.55 and interest.\n\n'June 30, 1900, the Fitchburg Railroad Company leased all its railroad and property of every description to the Boston & Maine Railroad for the term of ninety-nine years. In the lease the lessee covenanted to pay specified rentals, to maintain and replace the leased properties in manner indicated, to pay all operating expenses, and to pay 'all taxes of every description, Federal, State, and municipal, upon the lessor's property, business, indebtedness, income, franchises, or capital stock, or said rental,' and to pay divers other charges. In 1918 an income-tax return, under the provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1916 (39 Stat. 756) and 1917 (39 Stat. 1000), was filed on behalf of the Fitchburg Railroad Company for the calendar year 1917, upon which taxes amounting to $61,422.06 were assessed. These taxes were paid to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Boston & Maine Railroad pursuant to the term of the lease. The Fitchburg Railroad Company was consolidated with the Boston & Maine Railroad in 1919\n\n\n\n'In 1921 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an additional income tax against the Fitchburg Railroad Company of $3,920.55. In doing this he treated the payment of $61,422.06 made by the Boston & Maine Railroad to the collector of internal revenue as additional taxable income to the Fitchburg Railroad Company to the extent of $65, 342.61. This additional tax of $3,920.55 was paid to the collector of internal revenue by the Boston & Maine Railroad in July, 1921.\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 732, 734]\n\u00a0\n 'The claim for refund of this additional tax was duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but was never formally acted upon, and more than six months having elapsed after it was filed, this action was brought for the recovery of the tax so paid (under par. 20, Section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended by Sec. 1310(c), c. 136, 42 Stat. 310; 28 USCA  41(20)).'\n The judgment of the District Court was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and, upon the facts recited, and under section 239 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  346), the Court of Appeals has asked the instruction of the Supreme Court upon the following question:\n'Did the payment by the lessee of the net income taxes assessable against the lessor constitute additional taxable income to such lessor?'\n\n The merits of this case must be disposed of in accord with the rule already laid down in the Old Colony Case just decided. Like that, it is one in which the lessee has paid to the government the taxes due under the law from the lessor. The payment is made in accord with the contract of lease, and is merely a short cut whereby that which the lessee specifically agreed to pay as part of the rental effects that payment by discharging the obligation of the lessor to pay the tax to the government.\n Our conclusion is in accordance with the practice of the Department. Treasury Decision 2620 (19 Treas. Dec. 411). In answer to a question suggested by this Court, the Commissioner states in the appendix to the government's brief on reargument in No. 130 that it has been the uniform practice to treat taxes paid, where by agreement between the parties the tax laid upon the income actually received by one of them has been paid by the other, as income of the taxpayer whose liability has thus been discharged. He refers to the decision of the Circuit Court \n\n[279 U.S. 732, 735]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals for the First Circuit in the case of West End Railway Co. v. Malley, 246 F. 625, where the dividends paid by a lessee corporation directly to the stockholders of the lessor corporation were held to be income to the lessor under the Revenue Act of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. 114). It was carried into Regulation 33, promulgated January 2, 1918, as article 102, reading as follows:\n'Art. 102. Leased Properties.-When a corporation shall have leased its property in consideration that the lessee shall pay in lieu of rental an amount equivalent to a certain rate of dividends on its capital stock or the interest on its outstanding indebtedness, together with taxes, insurance, or other fixed charges, such payments shall be considered rental payments and shall be returned by the lessor corporation as income, notwithstanding the fact that the dividends and interest are paid by the lessee direct to the stockholders and bondholders of the lessor. The lessee, in making these payments direct to the bondholders and the stockholders, does so as the agent of the lessor, and the latter is none the less liable to return the amounts thus paid as income and to pay any tax that may be due thereon.'\n\n Article 102 of Regulations 33 has been substantially embodied in all subsequent regulations as article 546 of Regulations 45, article 547 of Regulations 62, 65 and 69, and article 70 of Regulations 74, promulgated under the Revenue Acts of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057), 1921 (42 Stat. 227), 1924 ( 43 Stat. 253), 1926 (44 Stat. 9), and 1928 (26 USCA  2001 et seq.), respectively.\n Article 109 of Regulations 45, promulgated January 28, 1921, reads as follows:\n'Taxes paid by a tenant to or for a landlord for business property are additional rent and constitute a deductible item to the tenant and taxable income to the landlord, the amount of the tax being deductible by the latter.'\n\n This provision is also found in article 109 of Regulations 62, article 110 of Regulations 65 and 69, and article 130 of Regulations 74. \n\n[279 U.S. 732, 736]\n\u00a0\n In addition to the foregoing general provisions, a specific ruling on this question was published in May, 1920, as A. R. M., 16 C. B. 2, p. 62. The facts in that case are stated by the Commissioner as follows:\n'A contract was entered into in July, 1917, between the P Company and the M Company, whereby the latter agreed to sell certain goods on a cost-plus basis. It was provided that the P Company should pay Federal taxes assessed on the profits accrued from this contract to the M Company. Performance under the contract was made by the M Company during 1918. In October, 1918, the P Company closed its books upon an accrual basis and made no provision for any taxes arising out of the contract. It was there held that the amount of taxes of the M Company paid by the P Company was income to the M Company for the year for which such payment was made. This ruling was followed not only in the case in which rendered, but also as a precedent in all other similar cases.'\n\n The Commissioner says that no single instance has been found where the Bureau has departed from this general practice of construing taxes paid under the present circumstances to be income to the taxpayer whose tax liability has been discharged in such a manner.\n The Commissioner says that it was the purpose of the instructions to establish a consistent policy, and that, if they have not been followed in individual cases, it is due to an unauthorized departure from the Bureau's instructions. More than this, it should be added that neither before nor since 1923 has any algebraic formula been used by the Bureau in computing taxes.\n Not only, therefore, is the conclusion that the question must be answered 'Yes' sustained by the practice of the Department under all of the Revenue Acts, but the cases cited in the Old Colony Case require the same view. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311\n, 48 S. Ct. 311, decided March 19, 1928. It is here by writ of certiorari for the determination of a question which arose upon the going down of the mandate in the Swift Case.\n The suit was commenced by the government in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on February 27, 1920, against the leading packers to prevent a long feared monopoly in meat and other food products. On that day a consent decree was entered. Nearly five years later, two of the defendants, Swift & Co. and Armour & Co., filed in the cause motions to vacate that decree. From the denial of those motions appeals were taken to the Court of Appeals for the District. That court certified questions to us. We ordered the entire record sent here; and then held that, because the Expediting Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544,  2, 32 Stat. 823 (15 USCA  29), provides for a direct appeal to this court in suits in equity brought by the United States under the Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15) the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction. We also held that the Supreme Court of the District had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties, and that the consent decree entered by it was in all respects valid and enforceable. Its order denying the motions to vacate the consent decree was, therefore, affirmed.\n An obstacle to the enforcement of the consent decree remains. An order of the Supreme Court of the District, entered May 1, 1925, suspends the operation of the consent decree as a whole 'until further order of the court to be made, if at all, after a full hearing on the merits according to the usual course of chancery proceedings.' That order (as we know judicially from our own records, Aspen Mining & Smelting Co. v. Billings, \n150 \nU.S. 31, 38\n, 14 S. Ct. 4) was made upon motion of the California Co-operative \n\n[279 U.S. 553, 556]\n\u00a0\n Canneries, which, long after the entry of the consent decree was allowed to intervene under the following circumstances.\n On April 29, 1922, the Canneries made a motion for leave to file an intervening petition. The petition accompanying the motion alleged that the consent decree interferes with the performance by Armour & Co. of a contract theretofore made with it, by which Armour agreed to buy large quantities of California canned fruit. The petition charged that the decree is void because the Supreme Court of the District lacked jurisdiction; and it prayed that the decree be vacated. The Supreme Court denied leave to intervene. The Canneries appealed to the Court of Appeals. That court, so far as appears, did not consider the question whether, in view of the Expediting Act (15 USCA  28, 29), it had jurisdiction on appeal. It did not refer to the decisions which hold that an order denying leave to intervene is not appealable, In re Cutting, \n94 U.S. 15\n; Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 311\n, 20 S. Ct. 636; Ex parte Leaf Tobacco Board of Trade, \n222 \nU.S. 578, 581\n, 32 S. Ct. 833; In re Engel-hard, \n231 \nU.S. 646\n, 34 S.

Ct. 372, except where he who seeks to intervene has a direct and immediate interest in a res which is the subject of the suit, compare French v. Gapen, \n105 U.S. 509\n, 524-526; Smith v. Gale, \n144 \nU.S. 509\n, 12 S. Ct. 674; Leary v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 567\n, 32 S. Ct. 599, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1029; Swift v. Black Panther Oil & Gas Co. (C. C. A.) 244 F. 20, 30. Nor did it refer to the settled rule of practice that intervention will not be allowed for the purpose of impeaching a decree already made. \n1\n On June 2, 1924, it reversed the order of the \n\n[279 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court, directed that leave to intervene be granted, and ordered that 'such further proceedings thereupon be had as are necessary to determine the issues raised.' California Co-operative Canneries v. United States, 55 App. D. C. 36, 299 F. 908. No such proceedings were ever taken.\n So far as appears, the Supreme Court of the District has not been requested by the government since our decision in the Swift Case, to rescind the order of suspension. Instead the government, upon the coming down of our mandate, moved in the Court of Appeals that its judgment of June 2, 1924, directing that the Canneries have leave to intervene and ordering further proceedings, be vacated. That motion the Court of Appeals denied without either an opinion or a statement of any reason therefor. This writ of certiorari was then granted to review its refusal. \n278 \nU.S. 592\n, 49 S. Ct. 31, 73 L. Ed. -. In support of the refusal, the Canneries contends that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction of the appeal from the order denying leave to intervene. It argues that the appeal was not within the purview of section 2 of the Expediting Act,2 because it was not 'an appeal from the final decree'; because the Canneries was not at the \n\n[279 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n time of its appeal a party to a suit in which the United States was the 'complainant'; and because, under section 226 of the District of Columbia Code, the Court of Appeals has, in its discretion, jurisdiction of an appeal from interlocutory orders. The contention is unsound.\n Congress sought by the Expediting Act to insure speedy disposition of suits in equity brought by the United States under the Anti-Trust Act. Before the passage of the Expediting Act the opportunities for delay were From a final decree in the trial court under the Anti-Trust Act an appeal lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and six months were allowed for taking the appeal. From the judgment of the Court of Appeals an appeal lay to this court; and one year was allowed for taking that appeal. Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,  6, 11, 26; Stat. 826, 828, 829. See United States v. E. C. Knight Co. (C. C.) 60 F. 306; Id. (C. C. A.) 60 F. 934, 24 L. R. A. 428; Id., \n156 \nU.S. 1\n, 15 S. Ct. 249, 39 l. Ed. 325; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association (C. C.) 53 F. 440; Id. (C. C. A.) 58 F. 58, 24 L. R. A. 73; Id. \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 17 S. Ct. 540. Moreover, there might be an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from a decree granting or denying an interlocutory injunction, Act of June 6, 1900, c. 803, 31 Stat. 660 (28 USCA  227). These provisions governing appeals in general were amended by the Expediting Act so that in suits in equity under the Anti-Trust Act 'in which the United States is complainant' the appeal should be direct to this court from the final decree in the trial court. Thus, Congress limited the right of review to an appeal from the decree which disposed of all matters, see Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364\n, 40 S. Ct. 347; and it precluded the possibility of an appeal to either court from an interlocutory decree. The time for taking the appeal from the final decree was shortened to 60 days.\n For the enforcement of the Anti-Trust Act within the District of Columbia, its Supreme Court has jurisdiction \n\n[279 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n corresponding to that which is exercised by the federal district courts in the several districts; and the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals of the District corresponds to that of the several Circuit Courts of Appeals. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n274 \nU.S. 145\n, 47 S. Ct. 557. In suits in equity brought by the United States under the Anti-Trust Act, an appeal by one who was permitted to intervene, like an appeal by one of the original parties, must be taken direct to this Court. Continental Insurance Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 156\n, 42 S. Ct. 540. Compare Buckeye Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., \n269 \nU.S. 42, 48\n, 46 S. Ct. 61. The purpose of Congress to expedite such suits would obviously be defeated if in the District of Columbia an appeal lay to the Court of Appeals from a denial of a motion for leave to intervene. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 38\n, 39 S., 24 S. Ct. 563. Even under the Act of 1891, c. 517, in cases where the appeal was taken direct to this court from the final decree in the trial court, every appeal thereafter taken in the cause was necessarily also to this court. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n249 U.S. 134\n, 140-142, 39 S. Ct. 237; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. J. F. Hasty & Sons, \n255 \nU.S. 252, 254\n, 41 S.

Ct. 611\n\n\n The order of the Supreme Court of the District suspending the enforcement of the consent decree was made pursuant to the judgment of the Court of Appeals of June 2, 1924. When our opinion in the Swift Case settled that by reason of the Expediting Act the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction of an appeal in a suit in equity under the Anti-Trust Act in which the United States is the complainant and that the consent decree is valid, all obstacles to the enforcement of the consent decree should have been promptly removed. In refusing to vacate its \n\n[279 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n judgment and mandate the Court of Appeals departed from the limits of admissible discretion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Forbes v.

The District Court and the Circuit Court of \n\n[278 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Appeals agreed in finding that the Proteus alone was in fault, but the Circuit Court of Appeals modified the decree against the United States by allowing interest on the damages found. 20 F.(2d) 729. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court (\n275 \nU.S. 521\n, 48 S. Ct. 159) to review the decision as to interest, consideration of the question to await the decision of this Court in the case of Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41\n, 49 S. Ct. 52, 73 L. Ed. -, which now has been decided (November 19, 1928), and in which interest was denied.\n Jurisdiction in Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States was granted by a special act authorizing judgment 'for the amount of the legal damages sustained by reason of said collision, ... upon the same principle and measure of liability with costs as in like cases in admiralty between private parties with the same rights of appeal.' It was held in view of the history of legislation that the words were to be taken strictly and that no interest could be allowed against the United States. The present suit is based upon the special Act of March 4, 1923, c. 321, 42 Stat. 1796, where the language is substantially the same, except that it is further qualified; jurisdiction of the suit is granted 'to the extent only of such damages suffered other than claims for the demurrage to (the Port Phillip) and to enter a judgment or decree for the amount of such damages and costs, if any, as shall be found to be due against the United States in favor of the owner of the British steamer Port Phillip or against such owner in favor of the United States, upon the same principles and measures of liability as in like cases in admiralty between private parties and with the same rights of appeal.' The only ground of distinction favorable to the Port Phillip is that in this case the United States filed a cross libel. It is urged that in view of that fact the principle of United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328\n, 45 S. Ct. 112, applies.\n But the difference between the two cases is plain. In the Thekla the United States came into Court of its own \n\n[278 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n motion as a libelant, and it was held that when the sovereign thus voluntarily brought itself within the jurisdiction in a collision case it should be assumed to agree that justice should be done, with regard to the subject matter, and therefore that it might be held liable in damages if its vessel was in fault. The main question in the case was whether the United States could be held at all. When that point was decided interest was allowed as generally it would be allowed against a private party, there being nothing to qualify the submission found to be implied. But in the present case the United States is brought into Court to defend its property under a statute that marks the limits of the liability assumed. The cross libel is really an incident of the suit, contemplated by the very words of the special act which provide for a decree in favor of either party, and it would be absurd to say that if the United States resorted to the usual instruments of defense the statute authorized what otherwise it did not allow.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

The carriers brought this suit in the federal court for that state to enjoin enforcement of the order and to set it aside. The District Court granted the relief. Erie R. Co. v. United States, 32 F.(2d) 613. The case is here on direct appeal under Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 USCA  47, 47a), and Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938, amending section 238 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  345). The sole ground for the carriers' attack on the order, and also the sole ground for the decree below, is that the shipments are wholly intrastate, and therefore the commission lacked jurisdiction over the rates.\n The commission found the following facts concerning the course of the business involved: The Hamersley Company makes to a New York broker, who is a commission agent for specified foreign mills, its offer to buy a certain quantity and grade of pulp manufactured abroad. The broker cables the offer to one of the foreign mills which he represents, naming the prospective purchaser. If the offer is accepted, the broker so informs the company and then makes a contract with it in his own name, sending a copy to the mill. The contract provides for shipment from abroad during a specified period and delivery, at the agreed price, on dock New York Harbor. The mill is not named in the contract. It ships to the broker the ordered quantities marked with a brand, but not so as to show the individual customer, and cables the broker when the shipment is made, naming the steamer, the quantity, the customers, and the date of expected arrival. This information is communicated by the broker to the company. It appears from the record that the broker pays the mill as soon as he is thus advised of the shipment, and that the ship's bill of lading is sent to him. \n\n[280 U.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n The pulp destined for the company may be part of a larger shipment. But the number of bales allotted to it are always delivered at Garfield; none may be diverted to any other customer; and no pulp is shipped to the broker for sale to purchasers, to be obtained while the pulp is in transit or after its arrival. Upon arrival of the pulp in Holboken, the broker gives to a terminal company the dock orders, specifying delivery of the required number of bales, and makes out the bills of lading for shipment from there to Garfield. These papers name the ship by which the pulp arrived at the Hoboken dock. There may be some delay in forwarding the wood pulp by rail after delivery on the dock, because, under an arrangement between the broker and the company, the pulp is shipped from the dock in lots of two or three cars in order to prevent congestion at Garfield. The freight from the dock to Garfield is paid by the company to the tail carrier. The commission found 'that from the time the pulp is placed on board steamers at foreign ports there is a continuing intent on the part of the shipper that it shall be transported to Garfield.'\n The carriers contend that title to the pulp does not pass to the company until the broker arranges, at the Hoboken dock, for shipment of the specific lot to Garfield; that the shipment by the mill to its agent, as consignee, of pulp in quantity exceeding that ultimately destined to Garfield, terminates when the pulp is delivered on dock at Hoboken; that this foreign shipment is distinct from the subsequent shipment by the broker to Garfield of the smaller quantity, under a new and local bill of lading; and that therefore the rail movement from Hoboken to Garfield is an independent intrastate transaction. But the nature of the shipment is not dependent upon the question when or to whom the title passes. Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 456, 465\n, 466 S., 35 S.

The findings of the commission, that the broker acts only as agent and that from the time that the pulp is put aboard the steamer there is a continuing intent that it should be transported to Garfield, ought to have been accepted by the District Court as conclusive, since there was ample evidence to sustain it.

Donovan, Assistant Attorney General, for the United States.[ United States v. Fruit Growers' Express Co. \n279 U.S. 363\n (1929) ]\n\n\n[279 U.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. S. Dalzell, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is brought here under paragraph 2 of section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (18 USCA  345). The paragraph was originally enacted in the Act of March Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  345). The paragraph It provides for appeals in criminal cases where the decision of the District Court is adverse to the United States and the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.\n This review is of an indictment of seventy-five counts against the Fruit Growers' Express Company, a corporation of Delaware, engaged in icing and re-icing refrigerator cars containing shipments of perishable commodities transported to Pittsburgh by the Pennsylvania Railroad, for misreporting ice furnished and falsifying the official records of the railroad company showing expenditures made in those shipments. By a contract executed by the two companies on May 1, 1925, the express company agreed to perform the icing and other service which the railroad company by and through its published schedules and tariffs had stipulated to perform with the shippers of such shipments. The express company, as provided in the contract, made and furnished written reports \n\n[279 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n of the quantity of ice placed by it in the bunkers of the cars for the railroad company at Pittsburgh. These reports were received and kept by the railroad company, and from them the railroad company prepared its reports of ice delivered, and rendered bills to the consignees of the shipments at Pittsburgh in accordance with its tariffs and schedules. In the performance of the contract, as the recitals of the counts of the indictment show, the agent of the express company in fifty-nine instances delivered less ice in each car, and in sixteen instances more ice in each car, than he reported to the railroad company, knowing that his report would be accepted by the railroad company as a true and accurate statement of the deliveries. The making of fifty falsified ice reports by defendant's agent was charged in counts 1 to 50. Counts 51 to 65 charged that, by falsifying ice reports, defendant made and caused to be made false entries in freight bills. Counts 65 to 75 were not urged by the government as valid. Each count of the indictment involved a separate carload shipment of a perishable commodity, and the falsification by the express company was charged to be of an official record 'kept by the Railroad Company' under the law. We have inserted in the margin the applicable parts of sections of the Interstate Commerce Act which are here involved. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[279 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n On behalf of the defendant, a motion was made and granted by the District Court to quash the indictment in all its counts, on the ground, first, that the quoted sections 10 and 20, relied on to support the indictment, are really intended only to apply to common carriers, their directors, officers, agents, and employees or others acting for and in the interest of carriers or in collusion with them, and not to persons whose only relation to a carrier is that of an independent contractor acting adversely to the carrier's interest in fraud of it and without its knowledge or acquiescence; and, second, that the counts of the indictment only denounce the keeping of false or inaccurate official 'records kept by the carrier' and do not include records not kept by the carrier, like bills, memoranda, and other data furnished by an independent contractor, intentionally misleading the carrier or its agents in keeping its official records.\n\n\n[279 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n The question is really one of the construction of the two sections of the statute quoted in the margin and the intent of their penal provisions. The general object of the statute was to require that common carriers should keep reliable records of the receipts and expenditures of and for each shipment which was the subject of transportation. They were intended to be an ultimate protection, not to the carriers, but to the shippers, to secure a proper accounting of the expenditures that might properly be charged to each shipper on the basis of the tariff published in accordance with law. Their importance is shown in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 32 S. Ct. 436 (56 L. Ed. 729), and United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n236 \nU.S. 318, 334\n, 336 S., 35 S. Ct. 363 (59 L. Ed. 598).\n It was the duty of the common carrier to provide for the icing and also to furnish reports as to the amount delivered in a record kept by it for the information of shippers and of the Interstate Commerce Commission. But there is no reason why this duty with respect to the furnishing of ice might not be performed by an independent contractor. Cincinnati, New Orleans & T. P. Ry. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 16 S. Ct. 700 (40 L. Ed. 935); Express Cases, \n117 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 6 S. Ct. 542, 628 (29 L. Ed. 791); Baltimore & Ohio S. W. Ry. v. Voigt, \n176 \nU.S. 498, 504\n, 20 S. Ct. 385 (44 L. Ed. 560); Chicago, St. Louis & New Orleans R. R. v. Pullman Southern Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 79, 89\n, 11 S. Ct. 490 (35 L. Ed. 97); Berwind-White Coal-Mining Co. v. United States (D. C.) 9 F.(2d) 429, 439; Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n237 \nU.S. 434, 443\n, 35 S. Ct. 645 (59 L. Ed. 1036). Such contracts, unless forbidden, are legal, but what their civil consequences are is often a question. If the duty performed is one which the common carrier is obliged to perform, the latter is civilly liable for the failure of the independent contractor to perform the carrier's duty. Whether a breach of the duty in such case will lead to criminal liability on the part of the contractor is a question of construction of the statute. Of course if \n\n[279 U.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n the common carrier were privy to the furnishing of short ice, or to the making of false preliminary data by the independent contractor, both the carrier and the independent contractor would become criminally responsible for the shortage and for the misrepresentation of the official record. But that is not the case we have here. The railroad company, having certain duties to perform in respect of the shipments, attempts to perform them by contract with an outside person not an agent of the carrier, and is itself deceived and defrauded by the contractor and outsider in his failure to perform his contract, so that by the falsification the carrier is led into the making of the erroneous report. In such circumstances, is the outsider to be held guilty of criminality under the above statutory provisions? Congress of course could render these false statements by the defendant a crime, but has it done so in the absence of any collusion by the railroad company? It is a nice question, but the statute is a criminal one, and may lead to heavy penalties. A defendant under such circumstances is entitled to a reasonably strict construction of the language used to effect the particular purpose that Congress has in mind. We do not think that Congress was looking to protect an independent contractor against his servants or a common carrier against its independent contractor. A fraud as between them was a matter collateral to the intent and object of the legislation in holding the common carrier and all its agents to strict responsibility to the shipper and the Commission.\n If the independent contractor colludes with the common carrier by the false data it furnishes, and the common carrier knowingly uses them, of course the contractor is nothing but an aider and abetter and so a principal in the keeping of the false official records, but otherwise not.\n The result is therefore that, while the independent contractor might well be penalized by a different statute for \n\n[279 U.S. 363, 370]\n\u00a0\n the fraud he has committed on the common carrier, we do not think that the present statutes bring him within the scope of the crime denounced, when the common carrier and its servants are innocent of offense.\n It is clear to us that the words 'record or memoranda kept by a carrier,' contained in section 20, mean the official record kept by the carrier, and do not refer to bills or memoranda kept by the contractor as a basis on which the carrier keeps its records. The defendant's bills or memoranda are not in that sense a record at all under section 20. They are not subject to the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and it would seem that, if the data proved to be dishonest and incorrect, the punishment for that, unless with the complicity of the common carrier, must be found elsewhere than in the provisions of the present Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.).\n This leads us necessarily to affirm the ruling of the District Court.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 10(1).

Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. Louis Quarles, of Milwaukee, Wis., and Walter H. Moses, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit by the United States, through its district attorney for the Eastern district of Wisconsin, against the John Barth Company, a corporation of Wisconsin, and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, a corporation of Maryland. The subject-matter of the suit is the recovery of the amount due on a bond in the sum of $60,000 whereby the respondents bound them- \n\n[279 U.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n selves jointly and severally to pay to the United States the sum therein named under the following circumstances and conditions:\n On June 25, 1919, the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed income and profits taxes against the Barth Company for the year 1918 in the sum of $126,182.81, and of this sum the company paid $74,764. 40. On September 15, 1919, and March 17, 1925, the company filed claims for the abatement of $39,501.58 of the taxes thus assessed. The Barth Company, as principal, and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, as surety, in consideration of the United States refraining from and suspending the collection of taxes thus outstanding against the Barth Company for the year 1918, pending consideration and adjudication of the foregoing claims for abatement, executed and delivered a bond on September 20, 1919, binding them to pay \"on notice and demand by the collector ... any part of such tax found by the Commissioner to be due, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum from the time such tax would have been due, had no such claim been filed.\"\n The Barth Company filed its claim of abatement on the ground that it had sustained a substantial loss resulting from a material reduction of the value of its inventory for the taxable year and from actual payment after the close of the taxable year of rebates in pursuance of contracts entered into during such year upon sales made during the year.\n On March 25, 1926, the Commissioner considered the claims, allowed about $10,000, and rejected the rest, in the sum of $29,842.32. The Barth Company was notified, and payment under the bond of the tax as determined, with interest thereon, requested on February 27, 1926, and on April 5 and 20, 1926, but the Barth Company refused to pay. On August 10 and 27, 1926, the Guaranty Com- \n\n[279 U.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n pany was notified of the rejection of the abatement claims in the sum above stated, and of the amount and interest due, but that company also refused payment. The suit was authorized by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n To the petition respondents filed a demurrer \"for the reason that ... the action was not commenced within the time limited by law which time is prescribed by sections 205d (205d) of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, and sections 277a-2, 278d, and 278e of the Revenue Act of 1924, and sections 277a-3, 278d, 278e, and 1106a of the Revenue Act of 1926.\"\n The District Court sustained the demurrer, the United States elected to stand on its complaint, and judgment was entered dismissing the complaint.\n The United States carried the judgment on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which after an unsuccessful effort to certify to this court certain questions, which were dismissed (\n276 \nU.S. 606\n, 48 S. Ct. 338), heard the writ of error and affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 27 F.(2d) 782. The case is now here on writ of certiorari.\n Paragraph 14(a),  234(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, provides that:\n\"At the time of filing return for the taxable year 1918 a taxpayer may file a claim in abatement based on the fact that he has sustained a substantial loss ... resulting from any material reduction ... of the value of the inventory for such taxable year, or from the actual payment after the close of such taxable year of rebates in pursuance of contracts entered into during such year upon sales made during such year. In such case payment of the amount of the tax covered by such claim shall not be required until the claim is decided, but the taxpayer shall accompany his claim with a bond in double the amount of the tax covered by the claim, with sureties satisfactory to the \n\n[279 U.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner, conditioned for the payment of any part of such tax found to be due, with interest. If any part of such claim is disallowed then the remainder of the tax due shall on notice and demand by the collector be paid by the taxpayer with interest at the rate of 1 per centum per month from the time the tax would have been due had no such claim been filed.\"\n\n In section 250(d) the provision is:\n\"Except in the case of false or fraudulent returns with intent to evade the tax, the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made, and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any tax shall be begun after the expiration of five years after the date when the return was due or was made.\"\n\n Section 250(d) refers to a failure of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to pass upon the return made by the taxpayer and to assess the tax. It is the determination preceding the assessment that is referred to in that section. If there is no determination and assessment within five years after the return is made, or after the return should have been made, then the statute bars an assessment and the collection of the tax due. But section 250(d) does not apply to the proceeding under paragraph 14(a), which relates to a case in which there is a return with a resulting assessment, as there was here, and the taxpayer seeks to reduce the assessed tax by presenting a claim for an abatement of part of it, and to avoid the collection of that part, pending action on the claim for abatement, by giving a bond. In this case there was a return and there was an assessment, but the bond was given well within the five years after the return, and when the bond was given it required the obligees, if the abatement was not allowed, to pay interest from the time such tax would have been due, had no such claim been filed. In other words, the limi- \n\n[279 U.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n tation of section 250(d) has no application to a situation following a claim of abatement and the giving of bond.\n The plain purpose of paragraph 14(a) was to effect a substitution for the obligation arising under the return and assessment to pay the tax, of the contract entered into in the bond to pay any part of the tax found to be due upon the subsequent determination of the Commissioner, and this with interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per month from the time the tax would have been due, had no such claim been filed. Of course, it is not difficult, in the somewhat complicated provisions to suggest, as on behalf of respondent it has been suggested, that some other than the ordinary inference to be given to this set of facts should be drawn, but the common sense view of the return and the delay in the payment due after the claim of abatement and the giving of the bond, is as already stated. The making of the bond gives the United States a cause of action separate and distinct from an action to collect taxes which it already had. The statutes now pleaded to bar the suit cannot be extended by implication to a suit upon a subsequent and substituted contract. The postponement of the collection of the taxes returned was a waiver of the statutory limitation of five years that would have applied had the voluntary return of the taxpayer stood and no bond been given. If there is any limitation applicable to a suit on the bond, it is conceded that it has not yet become effective.\n Section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265, repeats the limitation of 1918, adding thereto \"unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax,\" and like section 250(d) of the act of 1918 has no relevancy or effect here. The Revenue Act of 1924,  277(a)( 2) c. 234, 43 Stat. 253 (26 USCA  1057, note), repeats a similar limitation of five years. Section 1106(a) of the \n\n[279 U.S. 370, 376]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 113 (26 USCA  1249, note), provides that the bar of the statute of limitations against the United States in respect of any internal revenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability. This last act was repealed as of the date of its enactment. See section 612, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875.\n The government contends that this restores and gives life to the tax retroactively. It is not necessary for us to examine this claim, for the reason that the act of 1926 does not affect, and was not intended to affect, the obligation arising out of the bond. Such bonds are not referred to in the amendments of 1921 or 1924 or 1926, nor in any way is the taxpayer expressly or impliedly relieved from such contracts. To avoid the result usually ensuing from the return which he himself made, the taxpayer was permitted by a bond temporarily to postpone the collection and to substitute for his tax liability his contract under the bond. The object of the bond was not only to prevent the immediate collection of the tax, but also to prevent the running of time against the government. The taxpayer has obtained his object by the use of the bond, and he should not object to making good the contract by which he obtained the delay he sought.\n It is hardly necessary to refer to authority to justify this conclusion, but it is sustained by United States v. Onken Bros. Co. (D. C.) 23 F.(2d) 367; Gray Motor Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 367; United States v. Rennolds (D. C.) 27 F.(2d) 902; McCaughn v. Philadelphia Barge Co. (D.

White, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On the complaint of the Ft. Smith, Subiaco & Rock Island Railroad Company, called the 'Subiaco,' against the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and 353 other carriers by rail, the Interstate Commerce Commission made an order establishing through routes for west-bound freight traffic over the Subiaco. The Missouri Pacific brought this suit against the United States to set aside the order. U. S. C. tit. 28,  46, 48 (28 USCA  46, 48). The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Subiaco intervened. Section 212, Judicial Code (28 USCA  45a). The District Court, composed of three judges (U. S. C. tit. 28,  47), held that the Commission was without power to establish the routes and entered its decree granting the relief prayed. The United States and the interveners join in this appeal. Section 47, supra.\n The sole question is whether the Commission is authorized by the Interstate Commerce Act to establish the routes complained of.\n Paragraph (3) of section 15 provides: 'The Commission may, and it shall whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, ... establish through routes, ... applicable to the transportation of ... property. ...' Paragraph (4) of that section provides: 'In \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n establishing any such through route the Commission shall not (except as provided in section 3, and except where one of the carriers is a water line), require any carrier by railroad, without its consent, to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad ... which lies between the termini of such proposed through route, unless such inclusion of lines would make the through route unreasonably long as compared with another practicable through route which could otherwise be established. ...' U. S. C. tit. 49 (49 USCA  15).\n The entire line of the Subiaco is in Arkansas. It is 40 miles long, and extends from Paris, where it connects with a branch line of the Missouri Pacific, easterly to Dardanelle, where it meets a branch of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company, extending southerly 14 miles to junction with the east and west main line of that company at Ola. The Subiaco has not been able to earn dividends, and has long sought to increase earnings by having its line made a part of through routes for interstate traffic not beginning or ending thereon.\n In a proceeding initiated by the Subiaco against the Arkansas Central, whose line later became the Paris branch of the Missouri Pacific, the Commission, February 12, 1924, declared that such routes would be in the public interest, but dismissed the case for lack of proper parties defendant. Ft. Smith, S. & R. I. R. R. Co. v. A. C. R. R. Co., 87 I. C. C. 617. The Subiaco filed a new complaint that alleged need of more revenue to enable the company to continue operations and prayed for the establishment of through westbound routes via Little Rock, Ola, Dardanelle, and Paris. The Commission, Division 4, October 23, 1925, found that the company was earning a surplus over operating expenses and taxes and that on the showing there was no ground for abandonment of the line. The report shows that traffic to move over the proposed route must come from other carriers; that the Missouri Pacific, then probably not earning a fair \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n return, would be the principal loser; and that revenue diverted from it would largely exceed the amount that would go to the Subiaco. The Division reversed the earlier finding and dismissed the complaint. Ft. Smith, S. & R. I. R. R. Co. v. A. & V. Ry. Co., 102 I. C. C. 708. The case was reopened and upon further consideration the Commission, March 2, 1926, one of its members dissenting and two others not participating, found the proposed route desirable in the public interest, and made the order here in controversy. 107 I. C. C. 523.\n It directs defendants to establish and maintain through routes west bound over the Subiaco via Ola, Dardanelle, and Paris between points of origin and destination named in certain tariffs, which include places between which lie certain lines of the Missouri Pacific. The order contains a proviso: 'That this order shall not be construed as requiring any defendant to participate in any through route * * which would require it to surrender possession of traffic which it has originated or received from a connecting carrier to another carrier for transportation over a route which embraces less than the entire length of such defendant's railroad ... which lies between the termini of such route.'\n The Missouri Pacific has a main line that extends from Little Rock to Ft. Smith and points west. It also has lines connecting Little Rock with Mississippi river crossings at East St. Louis, St. Louis, Cairo, Memphis, Natchez, and New Orleans. Thus that company provides routes for traffic originating at these places and also a link in through routes for traffic originating east of the Mississippi on other lines and moving through these gateways to Ft. Smith, points on the Paris branch, or points on or reached by its line extending west from Ft. Smith. In each of the existing routes, the Missouri Pacific has the haul from the Mississippi to Ft. Smith and points on its lines extending through that place. \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 276]\n\u00a0\n There is no finding that any of these routes is too long or that the traffic covered by the order would be handled more advantageously over the proposed route. The situation in respect of all may be illustrated by the route from or via Memphis to Ft. Smith and beyond. Memphis is on the east bank of the Mississippi, about due east from Little Rock, which is at the geographical center of Arkansas. Ft. Smith is near and some distance north of the middle of the west boundary of the state. The order would compel the Missouri Pacific to use its Paris branch to establish a route to compete with those in which it has much longer hauls. The new route would give it a haul not more than the length of the Paris branch as against those over its lines from its Mississippi gateways to or beyond Ft. Smith. Its haul from Memphis to Ft. Smith is 308 miles.\n The main line of the Rock Island extends from Memphis to Little Rock; thence a little south of west via Ola to points west of Arkansas. Its rails do not extend to Ft. Smith, but its traffic reaches that place via Mansfield, and also via Wister, over the lines of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, and also via Howe over the Kansas City Southern Railway. There is no suggestion that the proposed through route is the only one available to shippers, or that without it they would be limited to lines of the Missouri Pacific for transportation from Memphis or from its other Mississippi gateways to Ft. Smith. Under the order complained of, the Rock Island would haul 222.3 miles from Memphis to Dardanelle, the Subiaco 40.3 miles from Dardanelle to Paris, and the Missouri Pacific 46.1 miles from Paris to Ft. Smith. Thus the route ordered gives the Missouri Pacific a haul of only 46 miles, while the existing route gives it 308.\n The act does not give the Commission authority to establish all the through routes it may deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. The general language \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 277]\n\u00a0\n of paragraph (3) is limited by paragraph (4). The latter lays down the rule that, subject to specified exceptions, a carrier may not be compelled to participate in a through route which does not include substantially its entire line lying between the termini of the route. The purpose is to protect the long haul routes of carriers. It is clear that, within the meaning of paragraph (4), the mileage of the Missouri Pacific between its Mississippi river crossings and Ft. Smith lies between the termini of all routes through or from such gateways west-bound over the line of the Subiaco. The existing routes include these Missouri Pacific lines and give that company long hauls as compared with the length of the Paris branch. The latter is the only line of the company included in the Subiaco route. The order is plainly repugnant to the rule prescribed by that paragraph. And, as neither section 3 (49 USCA  3) nor water transportation is involved, and existing routes were not found unreasonably long, the proposed route is not within the exceptions specified in that paragraph.\n The appellants oppose the application of paragraph 4 according to its terms and insist that it should not be construed to cover all routes which short-haul the carrier, but only those which deprive the carrier of its long haul after it has obtained possession of the traffic. The proviso contained in the order, reflecting that view, falls far short of protecting the carrier's long-haul routes as contemplated by paragraph (4). The language of that provision is so clear and its meaning so plain that no difficulty attends its construction in this case. Adherence to its terms leads to nothing impossible or plainly unreasonable. We are therefore bound by the words employed and are not at liberty to conjure up conditions to raise doubts in order that resort may be had to construction. It is elementary that, where no ambiguity exists, there is no room for construction. Inconvenience or hardships, if any, that result from following the statute as written, must be relieved \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 278]\n\u00a0\n by legislation. It is for Congress to determine whether the Commission should have more authority in respect of the establishment of through routes. Construction may not be substituted for legislation. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95-96; United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 386; Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 9 S. Ct. 651; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470\n, 37 S. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168; Ex parte Public National Bank, \n278 \nU.S. 101\n, 49 S. Ct. 43, 73 L. Ed. -; United States v. Colorado & N. W. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 157 F. 321, 327, 15 L. R. A. (N. S.) 167, 13 Ann. Cas. 893.\n Appellants seek to support the view for which they contend by some of the legislative history of the enactment and especially by explanatory statements made by Senator Elkins in connection with the report of the majority of the Senate committee submitting the bill for the act in question. the bill for the act in question. reports of the committees of Congress and statements by those in charge of the measure, and other like extraneous matter, may be taken into consideration to aid in the ascertainment of the true legislative intent. But where the language of an enactment is clear, and construction according to its terms does not lead to absurd or impracticable consequences, the words employed are to be taken as the final expression of the meaning intended. And in such cases legislative history may not be used to support a construction that adds to or takes from the significance of the words employed. United States v. Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 325\n, 17 S. Ct. 540; Penna. R. R. v. International Coal Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 199\n, 33 S. Ct. 893; Mackenzie v. Hare, \n239 \nU.S. 299, 308\n, 36 S. Ct. 106, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 645; Caminetti v. United States, supra, 490 of 242 U. S. (37 S. Ct. 192).\n But the reasons for and the significant circumstances leading up to the enactment may be noticed in confirmation of the meaning conveyed by the words used. Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 21 S., 25 S. Ct. 158; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 333\n, 29 S. Ct. 671; Northern Pacific Ry. v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370, 380\n, 32 S. Ct. 160; Mc- \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 279]\n\u00a0\n Lean v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 374, 381\n, 33 S. Ct. 122. Appellants' construction is not supported by the legislative history, reference to which is printed in the margin,1 but, all essential parts considered, it strengthens the conclusion that the words used express the purpose intended to be given effect.\n And appellants assert that the Commission in a long line of decisions has held that the rule declared in paragraph (4) applies only to traffic in possession of the carriers, and they argue that this construction was impliedly sanctioned by the inclusion of the provision without alteration in Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456). But the rule that re- \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 280]\n\u00a0\n enactment of a statute after it has been construed by officers charged with its enforcement impliedly adopts the construction applies only when the construction is not plainly erroneous and to cases presenting the precise conditions passed on prior to the re-enactment. New York, New Haven R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 401\n, 26 S. Ct. 272. The rule has no application in this case, because the decisions by the Commission do not show that it had given paragraph (4) the limited effect claimed by appellants, the order here involved conflicts with that provision, and, if any prior decision of the Commission held that the act empowered it to establish a through route substantially like the one under consideration, that construction was plainly erroneous and did not attach to or become a part of the provision re-enacted.\n Appellants also claim that decisions by the Commission before and since the re-enactment established a settled interpretation which should be given controlling weight in support of the order in question. It has been held in many cases that a definitely settled administrative construction is entitled to the highest respect; and, if acted on for a number of years, such construction will not be disturbed except for cogent reasons. See, e. g., Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Ct. 685. But the court is not bound by a construction so established. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 \nU.S. 97, 99\n, 40 S. Ct. 504; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 161. The rule does not apply in cases where the construction is not doubtful. And if such interpretation has not been uniform, it is not entitled to such respect or weight, but will be taken into account only to the extent that it is supported by valid reasons. Brown v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 568, 571\n, 5 S. Ct. 648; Merritt v. Cameron, \n137 U.S. 542\n, 551-552, 11 S. Ct. 174; United States v. Alabama Railroad Co., \n142 \nU.S. 615, 621\n, 12 S. Ct. 306; United States v. Healey, \n160 \nU.S. 136, 145\n, 16 S. Ct. 247; Studebaker v. Perry, \n184 \nU.S. 258, 268\n, 22 S. Ct. 463; Houghton v. Payne, \n194 \nU.S. 89, 99\n, 24 S. Ct. 590. \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 281]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, after careful consideration of the Commission's decisions, aided by elaborate arguments of counsel, we are unable to find that there has been established any settled interpretation of paragraph (4) in respect of the question presented here. Most of the cases cited differ widely from this one. Some decisions oppose the construction for which appellants contend. C. & C. Traction Co. v. B. & O. S. W. R. R. Co., 20 I. C. C. 486; Investigation of Alleged Unreasonable Rates on Meats, 23 I. C. C. 656; Chamber of Commerce v. N. Y. C. & H. R. Co., 24 I. C. C. 55; Hayden Bros. Corporation v. D. & S. L. R. R., 39 I. C. C. 94, 104; this case before Division 4, 102 I. C. C. 708; Wilgus v. P. R. R. Co., 113 I. C. C. 617. Many deal only with the right of the original or initiating carrier to have its long haul of traffic in possession and in through routes in which its line is included, and give no support to the contention that intermediate and delivering carriers are not within the protection of paragraph (4). Appellants rely on Waverly Oil Works Co. v. P. R. R. Co., 28 I. C. C. 621, and consider it the leading case and foundation of the line of decisions in which they rely. In that case, there was complaint against charged exacted for switching to and from industries on the Pennsylvania Railroad in Pittsburgh when the shipper desired to move its traffic from that place over other lines. The Commission did not fix such charges, but held, that it had power to establish joint rates from any point on such terminals, where traffic was received by the Pennsylvania, to a point on any connecting line and vice versa. In the course of its report, the Commission illustrated the practical application of the statute where a through route is made up of two overlapping lines. It is manifest that, without back hauling, each could not have its long haul. And that was shown by a diagram in the report. Page 630. The Commission held that in such circumstances the carrier that initiates and has possession of the traffic is entitled \n\n[278 U.S. 269, 282]\n\u00a0\n to its long haul and, by way of example, pointed out that the Pennsylvania would have the long haul on traffic originating on its terminals in Pittsburgh destined to a point on the Baltimore & Ohio terminals in Baltimore, and that the latter would have the long haul on traffic originating on its terminals at Baltimore and destined to a point on the Pennsylvania terminals at Pittsburgh. Plainly, that case is not similar to this. The construction for which appellants contend is indicated in these cases. First case in this controversy, 87 I. C. C. 617; Flory Milling Co. v. C. N. E. Ry. Co., 93 I. C. C. 129; this case, 107 I. C. C. 523; Port of New York Authority v. A., T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 144 I. C. C. 514; Stickell & Sons v. W. M. Ry. Co., 146 I. C. C. 609.\n Analysis of the decisions in detail is not necessary and would not be justified. It is enough to say that they have not been uniform and do not establish any settled interpretation that is applicable here. The construction of paragraph (4) in this case is free from doubt. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Section 4, Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 589, in force until the enactment of paragraph (4) of section 15 here involved.\n Interstate Commerce Commission v.

The court found her unable, without mental reservation, to take the prescribed oath of allegiance, and not attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and not well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same; and it denied her application. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree, and directed the District Court to grant respondent's petition. Schwimmer v. United States, 27 F.(2d) 742.\n The Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906, requires:\n'He (the applicant for naturalization) shall, before he is admitted to citizenship, declare on oath in open court ... that he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.' U. S. C. tit. 8,  381 (8 USCA  381).\n\n'It shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court ... that during that time (at least five years preceding the application) he has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same. ...' Section 382 (8 USCA  382).\n\n Respondent was born in Hungary in 1877 and is a citizen of the country. She came to the United States in August, 1921, to visit and lecture, has resided in Illinois since the latter part of that month, declared her intention to become a citizen the following November, and filed petition for naturalization in September, 1926. On a preliminary form, she stated that she understood the prin- \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 647]\n\u00a0\n ciples of and fully believed in our form of government, and that she had read, and in becoming a citizen was willing to take, the oath of allegiance. Question 22 was this: 'If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?' She answered: 'I would not take up arms personally.'\n She testified that she did not want to remain subject to Hungary, found the United States nearest her ideals of a democratic republic, and that she could whole-heartedly take the oath of allegiance. She said: 'I cannot see that a woman's refusal to take up arms is a contradiction to the oath of allegiance.' For the fulfillment of the duty to support and defend the Constitution and laws, she had in mind other ways and means. She referred to her interest in civic life, to her wide reading and attendance at lectures and meetings, mentioned her knowledge of foreign languages, and that she occasionally glanced through Hungarian, French, German, Dutch, Scandinavian, and Italian publications, and said that she could imagine finding in meetings and publications attacks on the American form of government, and she would conceive it her duty to uphold it against such attacks. She expressed steadfast opposition to any undemocratic form of government, like proletariat, fascist, white terror, or military dictatorships. 'All my past work proves that I have always served democratic ideals and fought-though not with arms-against undemocratic institutions.' She stated that before coming to this country she had defended American ideals, and had defended America in 1924 during an international pacifist congress in Washington.\n She also testified: 'If ... the United States can compel its women citizens to take up arms in the defense of the country-something that no other civilized government has ever attempted-I would not be able to comply with this requirement of American citizenship. In this \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 648]\n\u00a0\n case I would recognize the right of the government to deal with me as it is dealing with its male citizens who for conscientious reasons refuse to take up arms.'\n The district director of naturalization by letter called her attention to a statement made by her in private correspondence: 'I am an uncompromising pacifist. ... I have no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family.' She answered that the statement in her petition demonstrated that she was an uncompromising pacifist. 'Highly as I prize the privilege of American citizenship, I could not compromise my way into it by giving an untrue answer to question 22, though for all practical purposes I might have done so, as even men of my age-I was 49 years old last September-are not called to take up arms . ... That 'I have no nationalistic feeling' is evident from the fact that I wish to give up the nationality of my birth and to adopt a country which is based on principles and institutions more in harmony with my ideals. My 'cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family' is shared by all those who believe that all human beings are the children of God.'\n And at the hearing she reiterated her ability and willingness to take the oath of allegiance without reservation and added: 'I am willing to do everything that an American citizen has to do except fighting. If American women would be compelled to do that, I would not do that. I am an uncompromising pacifist. ... I do not care how many other women fight, because I consider it a question of conscience. I am not willing to bear arms. In every other single way I am ready to follow the law and do everything that the law compels American citizens to do. That is why I can take the oath of allegiance, because, as far as I can find out there is nothing that I could be compelled to do that I cannot do. ... With reference to spreading propaganda among the women throughout \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 649]\n\u00a0\n the country about my being an uncompromising pacifist and not willing to fight, I am always ready to tell any one who wants to hear it that I am an uncompromising pacifist and will not fight. In my writings and in my lectures I take up the question of war and pacifism, if I am asked for that.'\n Except for eligibility to the Presidency, naturalized citizens stand on the same footing as do native-born citizens. All alike owe allegiance to the government, and the government owes to them the duty of protection. These are reciprocal obligations, and each is a consideration for the other. Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 22\n, 34 S. Ct. 10 (58 L. Ed. 101). But aliens can acquire such equality only by naturalization according to the uniform rules prescribed by the Congress. They have no natural right to become citizens, but only that which is by statute conferred upon them. Because of the great value of the privileges conferred by naturalization, the statutes prescribing qualifications and governing procedure for admission are to be construed with definite purpose to favor and support the government. And, in order to safeguard against admission of those who are unworthy, or who for any reason fail to measure up to required standards, the law puts the burden upon every applicant to show by satisfactory evidence that he has the specified qualifications. Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 578\n, 46 S. Ct. 425 ( 70 L. Ed. 738). And see United States v. Ginsberg, \n243 \nU.S. 472, 475\n, 37 S. Ct. 422 (61 L. Ed. 853).\n Every alien claiming citizenship is given the right to submit his petition and evidence in support of it. And, if the requisite facts are established, he is entitled as of right to admission. On applications for naturalization, the court's function is 'to receive testimony, to compare it with the law, and to judge on both law and fact.' Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Pet. 393, 408 (7 L. Ed. 897). We quite recently declared that: 'Citizenship is a high privilege, and when doubts exist concerning a grant of it, generally at least, \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 650]\n\u00a0\n they should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.' United States v. Manzi, \n276 \nU.S. 463, 467\n, 48 S. Ct. 328, 329 ( 72 L. Ed. 654). And when, upon a fair consideration of the evidence adduced upon an application for citizenship, doubt remains in the mind of the court as to any essential matter of fact, the United States is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and the application should be denied.\n That it is the duty of citizens by force of arms to defend our government against all enemies whenever necessity arises is a fundamental principle of the Constitution.\n The common defense was one of the purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution. It empowers Congress to provide for such defense, to declare war, to raise and support armies, to maintain a navy, to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for calling it forth to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; it makes the President commander in chief of the army and navy and of the militia of the several states when called into the service of the United States; it declares that, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. We need not refer to the numerous statutes that contemplate defense of the United States, its Constitution and laws, by armed citizens. This court, in the Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, page 378, 38 S. Ct. 159, 161 (62 L. Ed. 349, L. R. A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856), speaking through Chief Justice White, said that 'the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need. ...'\n Whatever tends to lessen the willingness of citizens to discharge their duty to bear arms in the country's defense detracts from the strength and safety of the government. \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 651]\n\u00a0\n And their opinions and beliefs as well as their behavior indicating a disposition to hinder in the performance of that duty are subjects of inquiry under the statutory provisions governing naturalization and are of vital importance, for if all or a large number of citizens oppose such defense the 'good order and happiness' of the United States cannot long endure. And it is evident that the views of applicants for naturalization in respect of such matters may not be disregarded. The influence of conscientious objectors against the use of military force in defense of the principles of our government is apt to be more detrimental than their mere refusal to bear arms. The fact that, by reason of sex, age or other cause, they may be unfit to serve does not lessen their purpose or power to influence others. It is clear from her own statements that the declared opinions of respondent as to armed defense by citizens against enemies of the country were directly pertinent to the investigation of her application.\n The record shows that respondent strongly desires to become a citizen. She is a linguist, lecturer, and writer; she is well educated and accustomed to discuss governments and civic affairs. Her testimony should be considered having regard to her interest and disclosed ability correctly to express herself. Her claim at the hearing that she possessed the required qualifications and was willing to take the oath was much impaired by other parts of her testimony. Taken as a whole, it shows that her objection to military service rests on reasons other than mere inability because of her sex and age personally to bear arms. Her expressed willingness to be treated as the government dealt with conscientious objectors who refused to take up arms in the recent war indicates that she deemed herself to belong to that class. The fact that she is an uncompromising pacifist, with no sense of nation \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 652]\n\u00a0\n alism, but only a cosmic sense of belonging to the human family, justifies belief that she may be opposed to the use of military force as contemplated by our Constitution and laws. And her testimony clearly suggests that she is disposed to exert her power to influence others to such opposition.\n A pacifist, in the general sense of the word, is one who seeks to maintain peace and to abolish war. Such purposes are in harmony with the Constitution and policy of our government. But the word is also used and understood to mean one who refuses or is unwilling for any purpose to bear arms because of conscientious considerations and who is disposed to encourage others in such refusal. And one who is without any sense of nationalism is not well bound or held by the ties of affection to any nation or government. Such persons are liable to be incapable of the attachment for and devotion to the principles of our Constitution that are required of aliens seeking naturalization.\n It is shown by official records and everywhere well known that during the recent war there were found among those who described themselves as pacifists and conscientious objectors many citizens-though happily a minute part of all-who were unwilling to bear arms in that crisis and who refused to obey the laws of the United States and the lawful commands of its officers and encouraged such disobedience in others. Local boards found it necessary to issue a great number of noncombatant certificates, and several thousand who were called to camp made claim because of conscience for exemption from any form of military service. Several hundred were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for offenses involving disobedience, desertion, propaganda and sedition. It is obvious that the acts of such offenders evidence a want of that attachment to the principles of the Constitution of which \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 653]\n\u00a0\n the applicant is required to give affirmative evidence by the Naturalization Act.\n The language used by respondent to describe her attitude in respect of the principles of the Constitution was vague and ambiguous; the burden was upon her to show what she meant and that her pacifism and lack of nationalistic sense did not oppose the principle that it is a duty of citizenship by force of arms when necessary to defend the country against all enemies, and that her opinions and beliefs would not prevent or impair the true faith and allegiance required by the act. She failed to do so. The District Court was bound by the law to deny her application.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.\n The decree of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The applicant seems to be a woman of superior character and intelligence, obviously more than ordinarily desirable as a citizen of the United States. It is agreed that she is qualified for citizenship except so far as the views set forth in a statement of facts 'may show that the applicant is not attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same, and except in so far as the same may show that she cannot take the oath of allegiance without a mental reservation.' The views referred to are an extreme opinion in favor of pacifism and a statement that she would not bear arms to defend the Constitution. So far as the adequacy of her oath is concerned I hardly can see how that is affected by the statement, inasmuch as she is a woman over fifty years of age, and would not be allowed to bear arms if she wanted \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 654]\n\u00a0\n to. And as to the opinion the whole examination of the applicant shows that she holds none of the now-dreaded creeds but thoroughly believes in organized government and prefers that of the United States to any other in the world. Surely it cannot show lack of attachment to the principles of the Constitution that she thinks that it can be improved. I suppose that most intelligent people think that it might be. Her particular improvement looking to the abolition of war seems to me not materially different in its bearing on this case from a wish to establish cabinet government as in England, or a single house, or one term of seven years for the President. To touch a more burning question, only a judge mad with partisanship would exclude because the applicant thought that the Eighteenth Amendment should be repealed.\n Of course the fear is that if a war came the applicant would exert activities such as were dealt with in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S. Ct. 247. But that seems to me unfounded. Her position and motives are wholly different from those of Schenck. She is an optimist and states in strong and, I do not doubt, sincere words her belief that war will disappear and that the impending destiny of mankind is to unite in peaceful leagues. I do not share that optimism nor do I think that a philosophic view of the world would regard war as absurd. But most people who have known it regard it with horror, as a last resort, and even if not yet ready for cosmopolitan efforts, would welcome any practicable combinations that would increase the power on the side of peace. The notion that the applicant's optimistic anticipations would make her a worse citizen is sufficiently answered by her examination which seems to me a better argument for her admission than any that I can offer. Some of her answers might excite popular prejudice, but if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free \n\n[279 U.S. 644, 655]\n\u00a0\n thought-not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate. I think that we should adhere to that principle with regard to admission into, as well as to life within this country. And recurring to the opinion that bars this applicant's way, I would suggest that the Quakers have done their share to make the country what it is, that many citizens agree with the applicant's belief and that I had not supposed hitherto that we regretted our inability to expel them because they believed more than some of us do in the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD (dissenting).\n I agree, in substance, with the views expressed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and think its decree should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS(1929)\nNo. 104\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. Kaufman, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in the federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to recover upon an adjusted service certificate issued, through the Veterans' Bureau to respondent's husband, under the provisions of the Adjusted Compensation Act, 43 Stat. 121, c. 157, as amended by the Act of July 3, 1926, 44 Stat. 826, c. 751. Respondent's petition alleges the issue of the certificate, the death of the veteran, the interest of respondent as beneficiary, the filing of proof of her claim with the Director, and a failure and refusal of the Director to make \n\n[278 U.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n payment after demand upon him. A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the District Court upon the ground that the case involved a pension claim, in respect of which the courts were expressly denied jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals held otherwise, and sustained the jurisdiction of the District Court on the ground that the certificate embodied an express obligation of the United States. Williams v. U. S., 23 F.(2d) 792. We do not find it necessary to determine whether this view or that of the District Court is correct, but dispose of the case upon a ground urged here by the government, but apparently, it is fair to say, not suggested to either court below.\n The general administration of the Adjusted Compensation Act is committed to the Director of the Bureau. Under the terms of the original act, the certificate is to be issued by that officer upon certification from the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy. Section 501 (38 USCA  641). Application first must be made to the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy, as the case may be, who is authorized to transmit the same, together with a certificate setting forth, among other things, the amount of the adjusted service credit. Sections 302(a), 303(a), as amended (38 USCA  612, 613). From a consideration of the whole act it is clear that these officers must pass upon the facts which it is claimed justify the issue of such certificates. Section 310 of the amended act, hereafter quoted, makes it equally clear that their decisions upon these facts are final and conclusive. Section 502 authorizes a bank loan upon the security of an adjusted service certificate. If the loan be not paid at maturity, the note and certificate must be presented to the Director, who in his discretion may pay the claim and adjust the remaining balance with the veteran or his beneficiary. A fund is created in the Treasury of the United States and made available to the Director for payment of adjusted service certificates upon their maturity or the \n\n[278 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n prior death of the veterans to whom issued, and for payments to banks on account of loans made under section 502 (38 USCA  642) and sections 505- 507 (sections 645-647). Before any certificate can be paid it must, of course, be presented to the Director, who, necessarily, must first decide all relevant matters in respect of the right of the claimant to receive payment.\n It is not necessary to go further into particulars. A review of the entire act and the amendments shows, we think, that all questions relating to the right of any person to a certificate, the amount of it, etc., and payments to be made under its terms before or at maturity, are to be determined by the appropriate executive officer as a basis for his action. The effect of the executive determination, if that were otherwise doubtful, is set ar rest by the provisions of section 310 of the amended act (38 USCA  620), which reads:\n'The decisions of the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Director, on all matters within their respective jurisdictions under the provisions of this act (except the duties vested in them by Title VII) shall be final and conclusive.'\n\n Under the provisions of the act, and in the light of the section just quoted, we are of opinion that exclusive authority is vested in the Director of the Bureau to entertain and pass upon all claims for payment of these certificates. It is evident that, when a certificate is presented to the Director by one claiming to be the beneficiary, that officer must, as a necessary prerequisite to the payment, ascertain and determine that the veteran is dead, that the person claiming payment is in fact the beneficiary, and any other matter of fact or law which may affect the right of the claimant in any given case. We may assume that the Director performed that duty here. The record does not disclose the basis for his action; but, whatever it may have been, his decision is final, at least unless it be wholly without evidential support or wholly \n\n[278 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n dependent upon a question of law or clearly arbitrary or capricious. Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 45 S. Ct. 69, and cases there cited.\n For these reasons the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and that of the District Court dismissing the petition affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nW. A. MARSHALL & CO. v. THE PRESIDENT ARTHUR(1929)\nNo. 272\nArgued: February 27, 1929Decided: May 20, 1929\n\n\n\n Mr. George Wright Hinckley, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. John M. Woolsey and Samuel D. Stein, both of New York City, for respondent, \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 565]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In May, 1925, W. A. Marshall & Co., Inc., filed a libel in admiralty in the federal District Court for Southern New York against the Steamship 'President Arthur,' asserting a maritime lien thereon for an unpaid balance of the purchase price of bunker coal furnished by it on the request of the owner to and for the use of the steamship. The owner, the American Palestine Line, Inc., answered as claimant, denying that the Company had a lien on the steamship and alleging that the entire purchase price had been paid in accordance with the contract of sale.\n At the hearing the District Court held, on the evidence, that the Company had no lien on the vessel, and dismissed the libel. 22 F.(2d) 584. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 25 F.(2d) 648.\n The evidence-which is undisputed-shows that when the negotiations were entered into for the coal the Line wished to pay for it on longer terms than were usually granted, and that the Company, after investigating the standing of the Line, not believing that it was financially responsible, and wanting additional security, required the Line to give trade acceptances endorsed by responsible and acceptable persons; with the purpose that, if needed at any time, the money could be obtained by discounting the acceptances, thus endorsed, prior to their maturity.\n Thereupon, in February and March, 1925, the parties entered into two written contracts for the coal. Each of these provided that the Company should sell and the Line, as owner of the steamship, should buy, at a specitied price, a designated amount of coal 'to be used as bunker coal for' the steamship, and to be delivered on specified dates. Each provided that the Line should 'pay for the said coal as follows: By delivering' to the Company two trade acceptances, dated the date of the delivery of \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 566]\n\u00a0\n the coal, due March 10 and May 8, respectively, and 'endorsed by Jacob Wacht, Jacob S. Strahl and Joseph W. Gottlieb.' Neither contract referred to any lien on the vessel; and each recited that 'The entire contract between the parties is stated above and there is no outside condition, warranty, agreement, or understanding.' At the foot of each contract the persons named as endorsers also signed an agreement reciting that 'In consideration of the execution of the foregoing contract' and the delivery of the coal to the Line and of one dollar, they jointly and severally agreed to endorse the trade acceptances described in the contract.\n Without the consideration of such endorsements, it was shown, the Company would not have sold the Line the coal.\n The coal called for by the contracts was delivered to the steamship. The purchase price amounted to $21,736.16. For this the Line gave the Company its two trade acceptances endorsed by the three designated persons; these being consolidations of the four acceptances required by the two contracts. The acceptance for $11,794.54, first maturing, was duly paid. The acceptance for $9,382.62, maturing later, was not paid and was protested. This was the amount of the balance for which the Company claimed a lien.\n After filing the libel, the Company also brought a civil action upon the unpaid acceptance in a state court, against the endorsers only. This is still pending and undetermined.\n The questions presented here are: whether under the contracts the Company waived the maritime lien which it would otherwise have had on the steamship to secure the payment of the purchase price; and, if not, whether the delivery of the endorsed acceptances constituted under the contracts payments of the purchase price which extinguished the lien. \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n 1. As to the first of these questions it is necessary to consider the provisions of the Maritime Lien Act of 1910,1 relating to liens for necessaries, which were re-enacted in the Ship Mortgage Act of 1920.2 Subsec. P of the latter Act provides that: 'Any person furnishing repairs, supplies, ... or other necessaries, to any vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order of the owner of such vessel, or of a person authorized by the owner, shall have a maritime lien on the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem, and it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.' Subsec.  provides that: 'Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the furnisher of repairs, supplies, ... or other necessaries, ... from waiving his right to a lien, ... at any time, by agreement or otherwise. ...'3\n Prior to the Act of 1910 it had been settled that by the maritime law as administered in this country a lien was given for necessaries furnished a vessel in a port of a foreign country or state upon the credit of such vessel; but that no such lien was given for necessaries furnished in the home port or state. The Roanoke, \n189 \nU.S. 185, 193\n, 23 S. Ct. 491.\n The purpose of the Act of 1910, as shown by the Reports of the Committees of Congress, was to do away with this 'artificial distinction' and 'the doctrine that, when the owner of a vessel contracts in person for necessaries or is present in the port when they are ordered, it is presumed that the materialman did not intend to rely upon the credit of the vessel, and that hence, no lien arises'; and 'to substitute a single federal statute for the state statutes in so far as they confer liens for repairs, supplies and other necessaries.' Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., \n254 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 41 S. Ct. 1, 4 (65 L. Ed. 97).\n\n\n[279 U.S. 564, 568]\n\u00a0\n To this end the Act gave a maritime lien on any vessel, whether foreign or domestic, for necessaries furnished on the order of the owner or his authorized agent, and relieved the libellant from the necessity of alleging or proving that credit was given to the vessel. The Committee reports show, however, that it was not intended to make any other change in the general principles of the existing law of maritime liens, Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., supra, p. 11 (41 S. Ct. 1); and the specific provision that the Act should not be construed as preventing the furnisher of the necessaries from waiving his right to a lien, 'by agreement or otherwise,' indicates clearly, we think, that it was not intended to change the principles of the maritime law in respect thereto. That an express renunciation of the lien is not essential, is plain.\n We need not enter here into the general field of the waiver of maritime liens. Such liens differ in their character and are not equally favored-the lien for necessaries, which is a secret one, being stricti juris, Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., supra, 12 (41 S. Ct.). It suffices to say that we think the principles applicable to the question whether the lien was waived by the contracts entered into here, are aptly indicated in the following cases, which, in the main, were analogous in their facts to the present case, and were decided by members of this Court, sitting at circuit.\n In Murray v. Lazarus, 1 Paine, 572, 17 Fed. Cas. 1049, 1051 (1826), the libellants made a special agreement with the master for the payment of their advances for repairs and supplies furnished the vessel in a foreign port, and took from him a bill of exchange drawn upon the agents of the owner. Thompson, Circuit Justice, in holding that the libellants had no lien for these advances on the freight monies received by the owners, said: 'When an express contract has been entered into for the payment of such \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 569]\n\u00a0\n expenses, that must be resorted to, and will be considered a waiver of such implied lien if any existed. And a party who has waived his right in this respect cannot be permitted, at a subsequent time, and under a change of circumstances to reinstate himself in his former condition to the injury of others. ... If this is to be considered a regular and ordinary bill of exchange, it was a substitution for any lien that might have existed, and must be considered a relinquishment thereof.'\n In Phelps v. The Camilla, Taney, 400, 19 Fed. Cas. 441, 445 (1838), the libellants furnished the agents of the vessel in a foreign port copper which was used in repairing the vessel. The sale was made on a written order of the agents that made no mention of the vessel or her owners. The copper was charged to the agents, and they gave the libellants their negotiable note, which was not paid. The libellants claimed that the charge to the agents had been made by mistake, and some months later changed the account on their books and charged the copper to the ship and her owners. Taney, Circuit Justice, finding upon the evidence that the copper was sold to the agents upon their personal credit and was not furnished upon the credit of the brig and her owners, held that the libellants had no lien, but added; 'It must not, however, be understood, that the decision would be different, if the copper had been originally charged to The Camilla and her owners. It is true, that upon such a sale, the libellants would, in the first instance, have acquired a lien upon the brig; but that lien, in my opinion, would have been waived by taking afterwards the note of (the agents). ... If the party does not choose to rely on the contract which the maritime law implies in such cases, but takes an express written contract, he must rely on the contract he makes for himself, and cannot, upon a change of circumstances, resort to the securities upon which, in the absence of any special \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 570]\n\u00a0\n agreement, the law presumes that he relied; and if he takes a note or bill of exchange, or any other personal engagement, for the payment of the debt, he is presumed to rely on this personal security, and to waive his lien, unless he stipulates that the liability of the vessel shall still continue.'\n In Leland v. Medora, 2 Woodb. & M. 92, 15 Fed. Cas. 298, 299 (1846), Woodbury, Circuit Justice, speaking of the lien for repairs on a vessel, said that 'if the evidence ... shows, that the ship was not relied on originally, though foreign, but the master or owners or other security were, the lien does not attach any where, or under any form. The Maitland, 2 Hagg. Adm. 253; The Nestor (Fed. Cas. No. 10126) (supra).'\n In The Ann C. Pratt, 1 Curt. 340, 1 Fed. Cas. 947, 950 (1853), Curtis, Circuit Justice, in holding that there was no maritime lien for advances to the master of the vessel in a foreign port to make necessary repairs that had been secured by a void bottomry bond, said, citing The Nestor and other cases, 'that the lien created by the maritime law may be, and is, waived by the creditor, by any act or contract which is inconsistent with an intention to receive or retain that lien.' The decree in this case was affirmed in Carrington v. The Ann C. Pratt, 18 How. 63, 68, in which this Court said that 'it is well settled that the lien implied by the general admiralty law, may be waived by the express contract of the parties, or by necessary implication; and the implication arises in all cases where the express contract is inconsistent with an intention to rely upon the lien. A familiar instance is where the money is advanced or repairs made, looking solely to the personal responsibility of the owner or master.'\n In Taylor v. Commonwealth, 23 Fed. Cas. 756, 757 (1875), the libellant, before making repairs on the vessel \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 571]\n\u00a0\n at her home port, had entered into a written contract specifying that they were to be paid for partly in cash and partly in endorsed notes, that is, negotiable notes, with personal security. Miller, Circuit Justice, in holding that under these circumstances there was no lien on the vessel for the repairs, said: 'I have no doubt of the fact that a man doing that kind of work may rely on the owner of the vessel, and that if he makes no specific contract on the subject, he will have a right against the owner and the vessel; ... but that is a lien which the law implies from the circumstances, and if a specific contract is made which shows that the party relied upon other security and other modes of payment, then he cannot enforce the admiralty lien. It is very clear to me, here, that (the libellant) in making this contract, never intended to rely on the security of the vessel itself, because he made this contract for the very best kind of other payment. ... I think, having made an express contract for an express security, he cannot say, 'I did this work on the credit of the vessel.' In other words, I think if there is any question of admiralty lien, ... that it must have been the intention in the mind of the party who furnishes the supplies and repairs whether in a home or foreign port, to rely on the credit of the vessel. ... If it can be shown that he did not rely on that alone, and that he intended to rely on other security, which he supposed sufficient, or which was supposed to be better, then he had no lien, because the lien arises from implication, from the fact expressed or implied that the man in furnishing the supplies or contracting a debt, relied on the vessel as security, and if he relied on anything else it is another security sufficient, or supposed to be, which, in case that turned out to be insufficient, does not restore his lien.'\n In the present case the libellant, being unwilling to sell the coal to the owner for the use of the vessel without per- \n\n[279 U.S. 564, 572]\n\u00a0\n sonal security for the payment of the purchase price, before furnishing the coal made contracts which specifically provided that the owner should 'pay for' the coal at the time of its delivery by trade acceptances endorsed by three designated persons, who in consideration for the contracts agreed to endorse the acceptances. Neither of the contracts provided for any lien upon the vessel; and each, on the contrary, specifically recited that it stated the entire contract between the parties and that there was no outside agreement or understanding. Furthermore, upon the delivery of the coal, the libellant accepted the trade acceptances endorsed by the designated persons, and when it filed the libel against the vessel still retained the unpaid acceptance, on which later it brought suit against the endorsers.\n Applying the principles stated in the fore-going cases, we think that the libellant, having made specific contracts for an express security, instead of resting on the lien which the law would otherwise give, must rely on the contracts it made for itself, and cannot now, in a change of circumstances, resort to the lien it would have had in the absence of the special agreements; and that by taking other and different security, upon which it relied, and which it still retains, without stipulating for the retention of the lien, it has waived the lien which it otherwise would have had.\n\n 2. \nHolding that the lien was waived, it becomes unnecessary to determine whether the deliveries of the endorsed acceptances constituted under the contracts payments of the purchase price which would have extinguished the lien.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 36 Stat. 604, c. 373. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] This is the separate designation of section 30 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 988, 1000, c. 250 (46 USCA  911 et seq.). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] U.

NEARY(1929)\nNo. 59\nArgued: October 26, 1928Decided: January 2, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[278 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. Leo Weil, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In May, 1921, Neary, a citizen of New York of Samuel Untermyer and acting for him-brought suit in the Supreme Court of that state for more than $70,000, against A. Leo Weil and Charles M. Thorp, citizens of Pennsylvania. The defendants removed the cause to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, on the ground of diverse citizenship. In oral argument it was conceded that Untermyer is the real party in interest as plaintiff, so we shall hereinafter refer to him as such.\n By his complaint, amended by leave of court to conform to the evidence, Untermyer alleged that he had been retained as attorney and counsel for many creditors of one Josiah V. Thompson, a Pennsylvania banker and coal operator, to collect indebtedness amounting to millions of dollars. To that end Untermyer retained the defendants, Weil & Thorp, of Pittsburgh, to conduct bankruptcy proceedings under his supervision, upon an agreement that they were to accept $5,000 in full payment for their services. Such proceedings were accordingly instituted against \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n Thompson on the petition of three creditors in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and he was adjudicated a bankrupt. Trustees were chosen, and Weil & Thorp were selected as their counsel.\n Plaintiff's complaint avers that, because of complications which arose, it was thereafter agreed that the compensation of the defendants for services in the bankruptcy proceedings should not be limited as stipulated, and that the plaintiff and his firm, Guggenheim, Untermyer & Marshall, should collaborate with the defendants under the supervision of the plaintiff in the performance of services to the trustees. Also that the defendants should retain, out of allowances eventually made by the bankruptcy court in payment for their services, such sum as the plaintiff considered just and equitable, the remainder to be paid to Untermyer himself. Pursuant to this agreement, the defendants continued to render services in the bankruptcy proceedings under the general supervision of the plaintiff for which seven allowances were made and paid to them out of the bankrupt estate, from July 18, 1919, to May 10, 1924. The complaint further alleges that, in pursuance of the contract, the plaintiff fixed a fair and reasonable division between plaintiff and defendants, but that they refused to pay the plaintiff the sums claimed under that division.\n Weil & Thorp filed separate answers. They denied that there was any agreement, express or implied, between the plaintiff and them regarding the performance of services after appointment of the trustees in bankruptcy, or regarding the compensation for services performed by them thereafter. They admitted receipt of the allowances made to them by the court, but alleged that the services rendered after their designation and confirmation as general counsel to the trustees were rendered in collaboration with other counsel and not in collaboration with or \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n under the direction of the plaintiff or his firm; also that any services rendered by the plaintiff and his firm were rendered as counsel to the creditors' committee and not otherwise. They further said that any such agreement or understanding as that alleged by plaintiff would have been unprofessional, contrary to public policy, illegal, and void.\n There was no jury. The case was referred to a referee as under the New York Practice Act, who concluded that Weil & Thorp were jointly and severally indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $57,064, with interest from November 15, 1920. A judgment accordingly was directed.\n Pursuant to a written stipulation, signed and filed by the parties, the court ordered:\n'That the trial of the above entitled action be and the same hereby is referred to Allan Wardwell, Esq., as Referee, to hear, try and determine the same, with all the powers to act and rule upon the said trial possessed by the Court.'\n\n Requests for findings were submitted to the referee by both sides. He marked his rejection, modification, or approval of each, and filed a report of his findings of fact and conclusions of law. All were approved and adopted by the court. A bill of exceptions, prepared by the defendants, was not allowed because tendered out of time. In this situation the defendants concede that they are bound by the findings.\n The plaintiff contends that this court may not examine the findings to determine whether they support the judgment, and he relies on Campbell v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 99\n, 32 S. Ct. 398. That was a common-law case in a District Court at a time when no provision for waiver of a jury or for findings of fact by such court had been made by statute. Since then, sections 649 and 700 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA  773, 875), have been extended to District Courts. Now, under section 649, R. S., if in a common-law suit in a District Court the parties consent to refer the issues in accord with local practice \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n to a referee to make findings of fact and report conclusions of law thereon which the court approves and adopts, the appellate court may examine the findings and determine whether they support the judgment.

Cas. 1914A, 699).\n A summary of the findings follows:\n In 1915, Untermyer was retained as attorney for from 90 to 95 per cent. of the creditors of Thompson to collect his indebtedness out of his property, amounting to many million dollars. The affairs were greatly involved, and it was agreed among the creditors that the debtor's extensive properties should be conserved so that they might be applied equitably to the payment of the claims. In January, 1915, application was made to a state court in Pennsylvania for receivers, and they were appointed, and this held the estate together. But, when the case was carried to the Supreme Court of the state on error, the receivership was set aside, on the ground that it had been erroneously created. The defendants, Weil & Thorp, had no interest in or connection with Thompson, his estate, or his creditors until after the close of the receivership, when, in August, 1917, Untermyer employed Weil & Thorp to secure the adjudication of Thompson as a bankrupt, and retained the firm to initiate and carry through the proceedings under his supervision, fixing their compensation at $5,000. This was accepted, and accordingly, on the petition of three of the creditors of Thompson, on Sepember 10, 1917, he was adjudicated a bankrupt. Weil & Thorp, after their employment by Untermyer and before the bankruptcy, had helped in the effort to sell the properties under several plans, one of them called the Young plan, with the hope that all the properties could \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n be sold; but the plans as such failed, except that there was carved out of the Young plan the sale of what was called the Frick property.\n At a meeting of the creditors, trustees were selected on October 17, 1917, and their appointment was duly confirmed on the 18th. The defendants, Weil & Thorp, were, on October 18th, elected general counsel for the trustees upon their individual certifications in writing that they did not represent any interests which would in any way be antagonistic or adverse in the event that they were so employed. Untermyer, who had appeared previously in the record as counsel for the committee of creditors, was not elected counsel for the trustees and did not so certify. The certificate was filed by Weil & Thorp in accord with rule 5 of the Rules of Bankruptcy of District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania:\n'Attorney for the Estate and His Duties. Unless specially authorized by the court, receivers and trustees in bankruptcy shall not retain as their attorney, the attorney of the bankrupt, of the petitioning creditors, of the person applying for the appointment of a receiver, or of any creditor, and trustees shall not retain as their attorney any attorney who has obtained proxies or voted upon the election of such trustees, or who is an attorney for persons holding such proxies.'\n\n Immediately after the appointment of the trustees and their counsel, they proceeded to conclude the Frick sale. Its substantial terms had been negotiated by Untermyer as counsel for the creditors' committee prior to the bankruptcy. On closing it, a written application signed by Weil, Thorp, and Untermyer, was made to the bankruptcy court for the payment out of the proceeds of separate and exact compensation to Weil & Thorp, to certain associate counsel for the trustees, and to Untermyer. This was subsequently approved by the court. The expected sale \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n of the rest of the Thompson property under the Young option was never consummated, and the expected composition in the bankruptcy did not take place.\n The affairs of the Thompson estate were very complicated, and Untermyer was the person most conversant with their legal aspect. The trustees when selecting defendants as their counsel realized that they had been counsel for the committee of creditors under Untermyer.\n It had become apparent that the defendants had to perform services in the settlement of the estate which exceeded those originally thought to be necessary. Thereupon the contract was made between Weil & Thorp on the one hand, and Untermyer on the other, which is set forth in the amended bill of complaint, and on which this suit was brought. The defendants continued to render services under the general supervision and with the active assistance and collaboration of Untermyer and his firm. The trustees realized large sums for the benefit of creditors.\n Allowances totaling more than $142,000 were made in the bankruptcy proceedings and paid to the defendants as follows: September 3, 1918, July 2, 1919, and July 1, 1919, $30,500; June 1, 1920, $45,466; October 27, 1920, $68,093.\n On being informed of these payments, Untermyer, on November 15, 1920, pursuant to the agreement, decided that of the total sum so received the defendants should retain 60 per cent. and pay the remaining 40 per cent. to him. The defendants were duly notified of this decision, but refused to pay Untermyer any part of such receipts.\n On November 30, 1920, the firm of Weil & Thorp was dissolved. Weil succeeded as counsel in the bankruptcy proceedings, and further allowances were made to him, $21,000 on May 10, 1924, and later $23,000. Although 40 per cent. of these were claimed by Untermyer, the referee \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 167]\n\u00a0\n did not allow them. Untermyer had made no determination as to their division.\n The referee held that the contract between Untermyer and the defendants was limited to the preservation of the estate and came to an end with the final disposition of the properties by what was called the Piedmont sales, and did not apply to fees allowed Weil for services rendered in the general administration of the estate, for which the allowances of $21,000 and $23,000 had been made; also that the interests of the creditors represented by Untermyer were identical with those of the general creditors.\n Upon the facts so found we are of opinion that the contract sued on is clearly contrary to public policy and does not sustain the challenged judgment.\n It is contended that, in cases where a contract is attacked because contrary to public policy, the burden of proof is upon those who claim illegality, and that in such cases the principle res magis valeat quam pereat applies. Hobbs v. McLean, \n117 \nU.S. 567\n, 6 S. Ct. 870; Valdes v. Larrinaga, \n233 \nU.S. 705, 709\n, 34 S. Ct. 750 (58 L. Ed. 1163); Baltimore & Ohio S. W. Ry. v. Voight, \n176 \nU.S. 498\n, 20 S.

These cases state with force the necessity for maintaining the right of freedom of contract and the objections to lightly interfering therewith. But generally they turn on the construction of words and on the rule that the presumption, where there is an ambiguity, should be in favor of validity. They have little value here. There is no doubt of the meaning of the contract.\n Untermyer was counsel for many creditors. He was forbidden by rule No. 5, before quoted, to become counsel for the trustees unless specially authorized by the court. He represented 90 per cent. or more of the general creditors. \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 168]\n\u00a0\n There is no presumption or finding that the bankruptcy court especially authorized Untermyer to serve as counsel for the trustees or knew that the allowances to Weil were in part for Untermyer, or that he was to divide them between Weil and himself. Had there been evidence that the court had such knowledge, certainly the referee would have found it. The point was crucial. Nor is it strange that there was no such evidence. Untermyer's relations to the bankruptcy and to the creditors were such that it would have been difficult for the court to learn or infer that he had changed his activities from work for the creditors to that of the trustees without direct announcement of the change.\n Many abuses have occurred in the bankruptcy practice, and none is more frequent than that by which the attorney for petitioning creditors becomes counsel for the trustees subsequently appointed. This mingling of interests, frequently conflicting, is generally regarded by courts as working to the detriment of one of the parties and to the undue advantage of another. Experience has shown the wisdom and necessity of separating the function and obligation of counsel by forbiding the employment in different interests of the same person. In this way only may the court be advised how conflicting interests are represented. Rule No. 5 was adopted as an obvious safeguard. The danger of giving entire freedom of selection of counsel to the trustees lies in the temptation of the attorney for some creditors when he becomes counsel for the trustees, to use his function as representative of all the creditors, unjustly to favor or oppose particular creditors or to induce the trustees to do so. Rule 5 leaves it to the court to waive the restriction if with knowledge of the particular circumstances it appears safe so to do, but, if the court does not know of a proposed departure, it has no means of protecting creditors from the danger the rule is intended to avoid. \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 169]\n\u00a0\n The validity and effect of rule 5 came before the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit in W. J. Robertson's Case, 4 F.(2d) 248. One Kaufman, as counsel for certain creditors, had filed an involuntary petition for them. The receiver presented a petition to the referee for the appointment of Kaufman as his attorney. On the back of the petition there later appeared, written in lead pencil, the word 'Refused.' Apparently in ignorance of the refusal, Kaufman acted for the receiver without objection from any one. He filed several papers in behalf of the receiver, and obtained orders on some of them, and in all these it was recited that Kaufman was the attorney of the receiver. When a fee of $300 was asked for Kaufman, it was disallowed by the referee. On appeal the District Court affirmed the order. Of rule 5, now under consideration, the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'The court is vested with authority to make this rule. Section 2(15) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (Comp. St.  9586 (11 USCA  11)). It seems to us both wise and reasonable. ... While on general principles the laborer is worthy of his hire, and counsel should be paid a reasonable fee for services rendered, yet the apparent retention here was a plain violation of the rule of court. It was the duty of the receiver to comply with the rules of court. Both he and the petitioner are attorneys and knew the rule. Otherwise a petition for authority to retain Mr. Kaufman would not have been presented. If the receiver and his counsel chose to act in disregard of, or in opposition to, the rule, or upon an unwarranted assumption that authority had been or would be given, they are responsible for the consequences of the refusal of authority.'\n\n It is clear that a rule of court thus authorized and made has the force of law. Rio Grande Irrigation Co. v. Gildersleeve, \n174 \nU.S. 603, 608\n, 19 S. Ct. 761 (43 L. Ed. 1103); Thompson v. Hatch, 3 Pick. (Mass.) 512; District of Columbia v. Roth, 18 App. D. C. 547, 550; Murphy v. Gould, 39 App. D. C. 363, 367; Wil- \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 170]\n\u00a0\n kinson v. Walker (D. C.) 292 F. 402; State ex rel. Whitaker v. Lankford, 158 Ind. 34, 62 N. E. 624; Advance Veneer & Lumber Co. v. Horaday, 49 Ind. App. 83, 96 N. E. 784.\n Early in the bankruptcy proceedings on the conclusion of the Frick sale the court allowed specific compensation to the defendants, to certain associate counsel for the trustees, and to Untermyer. This, it is suggested, shows the court knew Untermyer was receiving compensation for services to the trustees and approved such action. But this incident has no such significance. It merely indicates that the court approved an agreement between counsel to pay the expenses of the trust incurred largely before the bankruptcy, of which its indebtendness for Untermyer's services in making the Frick sale, while he was acting as counsel for the committee of creditors, was properly one. It is entirely consistent with subsequent want of information by the court that Untermyer was serving as counsel for the trustees.\n The referee suggests that failure by Weil or Untermyer to advise the court of the contract sued on ought not to invalidate it, because, if either had called attention to the arrangement, there would have been no objection by the court. We quote from his opinion:\n'The only objection that I can see to the contract was one that does not seem in terms to have been made known to the Court or to the Referee. But there is no reason to suppose that had the plaintiff called the attention of the Court to the arrangement as made, there would have been any objection to the plaintiff's sharing in these fees. Certainly the Court's or the Referee's ignorance of the agreement did not tend to increase the allowances to counsel. Nor is there anything but commendation by the Referee and the Court for the services rendered to the estate by counsel in which the plaintiff bore a considerable part, whether or not that fact was known to the Court. In any event it does not seem to me that \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 171]\n\u00a0\n the defendants can contend that the failure to bring this matter to the attention of the Court on subsequent allowances, as they did on the Frick sale, can be put forward to defeat the plaintiff's contention.'\n\n We cannot concur in this view. We find no reason for assuming that the District Court would not have made serious objection to the contract had it known its terms. Such an assumption would be unfair to the court. Certainly it was not for another court to determine whether the situation justified a waiver of the rule. The referee and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was the duty of Weil to advise the court of the contract. We think it was no more the obligation of Weil than it was of Untermyer. Both were engaging in the same violation of the rule.\n There were two issues in the present case. One was whether the contract sued on was made. Weil said it was not. Untermyer said it was, and the referee has found with him. The other issue was whether the agreement between Untermyer and Weil was contrary to public policy. The referee found that both participated in the breach of the rule. Neither can be relieved from the resulting invalidity of the contract by charging that the other ought to have told the court of it.\n The controversy is not an ordinary one between the two parties. The issue concerns the action of both Untermyer and Weil towards the bankruptcy court. A question of public policy is presented-not a mere adjudication of adversary rights between the two parties.\n Another feature of the contract that calls for condemnation is the provision that Untermyer shall have power to supervise and direct Weil in the rendition of service to the trustees. Of this, the court certainly could know nothing. Weil's duty was to exercise his independent judgment in respect of his duties. He could not abdicate to Untermyer. The contract made the latter dominus \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 172]\n\u00a0\n litis, and operated as an intolerable imposition on the judge of the bankruptcy court. This was contrary to public policy; it was in direct conflict with the professional and official duty of Weil as an officer of the bankruptcy court and counsel for the trustees.\n Still another reason for condemnation of this contract is the provison under which the compensation allowed to Weil was to be divided by Untermyer between the two. The court made allowances to Weil without knowledge that a part of them was to be received and enjoyed by Untermyer. It necessarily assumed that allowances were being made to Weil and no one else. Instead of this, they really were made to Untermyer, the attorney for creditors, for such division between Weil and himself as he might determine. The evils to which such a practice might lead are manifest. It would, in effect, take from the court the judicial function and vest it in an unrecognized stranger.\n Both the Circuit Court of Appeals and the referee held that this provision of the contract would not tend to increase the allowance to counsel. We are unable to follow the argument. Certainly there would be a temptation to both Untermyer and Weil to seek so to increase the allowance as to secure a generous provision for both. Motive for excessive allowance could hardly be more direct.\n For the protection of the estate and itself, the bankruptcy court must rely largely on counsel for the trustees, as also on counsel for creditors, to keep watch against unjust charges. Under this contract there would be an obvious incentive for counsel to do otherwise.\n Complaints of those interested in the honest and effective administration of bankruptcy law led this court three years ago to adopt several new rules in respect to the compensation of attorneys, receivers, and trustees. Rule 42 requires that, where an attorney applies for compensation from a bankrupt estate, he shall file a petition under \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 173]\n\u00a0\n oath, setting forth a full and detailed statement of his services, and the amount claimed therefor, to be accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant that no agreement has been made, directly or indirectly, and that no understanding exists, for a division of fees between the applicant, the receiver, the trustee, the bankrupt, or the attorney of any of them; and the rule directs that no allowance of compensation shall be made in the absence of such petition and affidavit. These rules were adopted after the contract in this case was made, and therefore have no direct application here. But they clearly show the previous abuses which it was hoped to avoid by their adoption, and explain the necessity and reason for the earlier adoption of rule 5, in the Western district of Pennsylvania, which does apply to the contract here and renders it illegal.\n We have specially referred to rule 5, under which the illegalitly of the contract is clear, but we are not to be understood as holding that, without the rule, the transaction under consideration would not be contrary to public policy and void.\n The chief argument that is pressed upon us to declare the contract valid and to sustain the judgment based upon it is the success with which the plaintiff is found to have worked out a useful settlement of the estate for the benefit of the creditors, and the absence of any finding or showing that there was actual fraud. But this is not a sufficient answer to the charge of illegality. The contract is contrary to public policy- plainly so. What is struck at in the refusal to enforce contracts of this kind is not only actual evil results but their tendency to evil in other cases. Even if the ultimate results in the management of the Thompson estate were good, that could be no excuse for a contract plainly illegal, because tending to produce the recognized abuses which follow fraud and disloyalty by agents and trustees. Enforcement of such contracts, when \n\n[278 U.S. 160, 174]\n\u00a0\n actual evil does not follow, would destroy the safeguards of the law and lessen the prevention of abuses. Providence Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45; Woodstock Iron Co. v. Richmond Extension Co., \n129 \nU.S. 643\n, 9 S. Ct. 402; Oscanyan v. Winchester Arms Co., \n103 U.S. 261\n 26 L. Ed. 539; Meguire v. Corwine, \n101 U.S. 108\n; Connors v. Connolly, 86 Conn. 641, 86 A. 600, 45 L. R. A. (N. S.) 564; Richardson v. Crandall, 48 N. Y. 348; Palmbaum v. Magulsky, 217 Mass. 306, 308, 104 N. E. 746 (Ann. Cas. 1915D, 799). But we must not be understood as implying that no harm resulted to the Thompson estate or its creditors.\n We conclude that the contract set up by Untermyer in the amended petition, framed to meet the evidence, is in violation of public policy and professional ethics. Such a transaction between counsel calls for judicial condemnation. This requires a reversal of the judgment of the court below.\n Where a party seeks to enforce a contract, and it is found to be invalid because contrary to public policy, the usual result is that the court dismisses the action and leaves the parties as it finds them. Weil, the defendant appearing pro se, announced to us in open court that he would be entirely content with any disposition of the amount sued for, provided it was not appropriated to the satisfaction of a contract deemed plainly illegal and void, and the making of which he denied. He tendered his consent to any disposition of the funds in controversy which this court might regard as proper. The difficulty with that proposal is the want of power in this case to make a disposition of the funds with due regard to the bankruptcy proceeding which is not now before this court. We therefore must reverse the judgment below and direct a dismissal of the action, leaving Weil to take such steps as may be appropriate to enable the bankruptcy court to pass the funds in controversy to the creditors.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEISS v. WIENER(1929)\nNo. 482\nArgued: April 12, 1929Decided: April 22, 1929\n\n\n\n\n[279 U.S. 333, 334]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. H. Lewis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Edwin W. Brouse, of Akron, Ohio, and James S. Y. Ivins, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits brought by Wiener, the respondent, to recover amounts that he says should have been allowed as deductions from his income taxes but that were disallowed. The petitioners, the defendants, prevailed in the District Court, Wiener v. Weiss, 17 F.(2d) 650; but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 27 F.(2d) 200, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n\n[279 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n Wiener was in the business of taking long leases of property and subletting. He held 13 leases for 99 years, renewable forever. He claimed that the right to make an annual deduction from his income tax for estimated depreciation of the buildings, relying upon section 214(a)(8) of the taxing act, Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1066, 1067, which granted deduction of 'a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' He was allowed all sums paid for repairs but nothing for the estimated obsolescence for which he had not paid. It may be taken for the purposes of decision that Wiener undertook to keep the buildings up to their present condition, to pay rent even if the buildings were destroyed and that his obligations were sanctioned by a liability to forfeiture. It is argued with much elaboration that not only covenants but economic necessity required the respondent to keep the buildings up to the mark and that the amount needed for this purpose should be allowed.\n The income tax laws do not profess to embody perfect economic theory. They ignore some things that either a theorist or a business man would take into account in determining the pecuniary condition of the taxpayer. They do not charge for appreciation of property or allow a loss from a fall in market value unless realized in money by a sale. United States v. S. S. White Dental Co., \n274 \nU.S. 398, 401\n, 47 S. Ct. 598 (71 L. Ed. 1120). A stockholder does not pay for accumulated profits of his corporation unless he receives a dividend. That is the general principle upon which these laws go. It is true that they allow for obsolescence of buildings, etc., where the loss is of materials not of money, but there as elsewhere the loss must be actual and present, not merely contemplated as more or less sure to occur in the future. If the taxpayer owns the property the loss actually has \n\n[279 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n taken place. But with Wiener it had not, and it might never fall on him, as was pointed out by the District Judge. Some of the leases were assigned and others surrendered to the lessor. In such cases it would be a mere speculation to suppose that depreciation was taken into account the transactions. Probably other and dominant considerations induced the acts. The event showed that in those cases there was no true basis for Wiener's claim.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals interpreting United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295\n, 47 S. Ct. 608, said that the purpose of the revenue act is to tax only gain, and that the amount thus allowed to be set aside is not gain, but is capital that has gone into gross income. But it is very clear that as yet the capital of the lessee has not gone into it, and upon the considerations just mentioned it is not enough that he has made a contract that very possibly may not be carried out to replace that capital at some future time. If, as we think, such a contract is not enough to cause the lessee a present loss by wear and tear, the fact, which may be assumed, that the property was used by him in his business, does not matter. Of course he must show an interest in the property and a present loss to him to make the statute apply.\n In Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364\n, 45 S. Ct. 274, a statutory provision for deducting from gross income a reasonable allowance for depletions of mines was held applicable to a lessee bound to mine a minimum tonnage and to pay a stated royalty. In such a case the whole value of the lease is in the right to remove the ore, that is to destroy as rapidly as may be the real object of the lease. But in the case of a house or shop the value is not in the right to destroy and the destruction is only an undesired, gradual and subordinate incident of the use. The diminution in the value of a mine to the lessee is conspicuous, necessary, and intended, and is the very source of the gross income of \n\n[279 U.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n the lessee from which it is deducted, whereas the wear and tear of a house or shop in any given year may be only recognizable by theory and, as has happened in this case, may cost the lessee nothing while the premises are in his hands.\n It does not matter that in Ohio, where the properties lie, these long leases are treated as in many respects like conveyances of the fee. The Act of Congress has its own criteria, irrespective of local law, that look to certain rather severe tests of liability and exemption and that do not allow the deductions demanded whatever the lessees may be called. We understand this to be the view taken by the Department for a long time and we are of opinion that it should not be disturbed.\n Judgment of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgment of District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEST v.

C., for respondent.\n\n\n[278 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in October, 1925, by the Standard Oil Company in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against Dr. Work, the then Secretary of the Interior, to enjoin the continuation of proceedings in the local land office at Visalia, Cal., ordered by him with a view to ascertaining and determining whether particular lands were known to be mineral in character when the survey of them was accepted. State of California, Standard Oil Co., Transferees, 51 L. D. 141. Upon his resignation, Secretary West was substituted as defendant. The proceedings were of the kind commonly employed by the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain the existence of alleged facts reported by a representative of the General Land Office, because of which the title of one claiming public lands is questioned in the Department. The Register and Receiver, after hearing the parties in interest, make report of their findings. These are subject to an appeal, on the evidence, to the Land Commissioner, and also to a further appeal to the secretary. Upon the ultimate findings, the Commissioner decides, subject to the supervision and control of the Secretary, what action, if any, shall be taken. Compare George W. Dally, 41 L. D. 295, 299. Circular No. 460, February 26, 1916, 44 L. D. 572, prescribes the procedure.\n The proceedings here involved concern section 36, township 30 south, range 23 east, Mr. Diabolo B. & M.-that land being in Elk Hills, Kern county, Cal. Section 36 is one of the Sections in each township which, if not mineral or otherwise disposed of, was \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n granted by Congress to the state of California in aid of public schools, by Act of March 3, 185o, c. 145,  6, 10 Stat. 244, 246. Under patents issued by the state in 1910, and mesne conveyances, the Standard Oil Company claims title to part, and an interest in the rest, of the section. Drilling on this land, gegun in 1918, has been followed by extensive oilmining operations. The proceedings were based on a charge that on January 26, 1903, the date of the approval of the survey, the land was known to be mineral in character. If the land was then known to be mineral, the title confessedly did not pass by the act; for Congress excluded mineral land from the grant. Ivanhoe Mining Co. v. Keystone Consolidated Mining Co., \n102 U.S. 167\n; Mullan v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 271, 276\n, 6 S. Ct. 1041 (30 L. Ed. 170). See, also, Wyoming v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 489, 500\n, 41 S. Ct. 393 (65 L. Ed. 742); Work v. Louisiana, \n269 \nU.S. 250, 257\n, 258 S., 46 S. Ct. 92 (70 L. Ed. 259). If it was not then known to be mineral, the legal title passed to the state on that date; for the land was within one of the sections in place designated in the granting act. United States v. Morrison, \n240 \nU.S. 192\n, 36 S. Ct. 326; United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, 38 S. Ct. 193.\n The act of 1853 here involved, like those granting school lands to many other states,1 makes no provision for determining what part of the land is thus excluded from the grant. It does not provide for the issue of patents or for any equivalent action by the Department to evidence the transfer of title to the state. No partent to the state, or \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 209]\n\u00a0\n evidence of title or interest in another, has in fact been issued by the Secretary of the Interior. Nor has there been in the Department any contest between the state and another claimant which might have resulted in a determination of the character of the land. Whether this land was known to be mineral at the date of the survey must therefore be established otherwise. The Standard Oil Company contends that its nonmineral character had, before Secretary Work's order, been established by a final determination in the Department; that thereby the Department lost jurisdiction over the land; and that, for this reason, continuation of the proceedings should be enjoined. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that among the several officers of the Land Department action had repeatedly been taken having some relation to the charter of the land prior to the order of Secretary Work. The survey, which was approved January 26, 1903, returned it as mineral. In 1904, a special agent reported it as nonmineral. In 1908, it was temporarily withdrawn from agricultural entry pending examination and classification by the United States Geological Survey. In 1909, the Director of the Geological Survey classified it as oil land. In 1910, the Secretary recommended its withdrawal for a petroleum reserve, and the recommendation was approved by the President. In 1912, it was placed in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1. On January 14, 1914, the proceedings in the land office here involved were initiated. The papers having been mislaid or misfiled in the local office, the proceedings lay dormant; and process was not served until after March 2, 1921. Then the Register and Receiver were ordered by the Land Commissioner, under Secretary Payne, to proceed in accordance with circular No. 460. On June 9, \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 210]\n\u00a0\n 1921, before further action thereon, Secretary Fall directed the Land Commissioner to dismiss the proceedings and notify all parties in interest of the dismissal.\n On May 8, 1925, Secretary Work vacated Secretary Fall's order and directed the Register and Receiver to proceed to a hearing of the charge that the land was known to be mineral in character on January 26, 1903.3 If at the time of Secretary Work's order the Department still had jurisdiction of the land, he possessed the power to review the action of his predecessor and to deal with the matter as freely as he could have done if the dismissal of the proceedings had been his own act or that of a subordinate official. For, so long as the Department retains jurisdiction of the land, administrative orders concerning it are subject to revision. New Orleans v. Paine, \n147 \nU.S. 261\n, 13 S. Ct. 303; Beley v. Naphtaly, \n169 \nU.S. 353, 364\n, 18 S. Ct. 354 (42 L. Ed. 775); Lane v. Darlington, \n249 \nU.S. 331\n, 39 S. Ct. 299; Parcher v. Gillen, 26 L. D. 34; Aspen Consolidated Mining Co. v. Williams, 27 L. D. 1. Compare Louisiana v. Garfield, \n211 \nU.S. 70, 75\n, 29 S. Ct. 31 (53 L. Ed. 92). If, on the other hand, either Secretary Fall's order of dismissal, or some earlier action of the government, terminated the jurisdiction of the Department, Secretary Work's order reinstating the proceedings was a nullity; and the Standard Oil Company is entitled to enjoin their continuance. Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165\n, 13 S. Ct. 271; Lane v. Watts, \n234 \nU.S. 525\n, 34 S. Ct. 965; Burke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 686\n, 34 S. Ct. 907 (58 L. Ed. 1527).\n In support of its contention that the jurisdiction had ended, the company relied bill upon two earlier acts of the Department, besides Secretary Fall's order, as constituting a final determination that the land was not known to be mineral at the date of the approval of the \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 211]\n\u00a0\n survey. The Supreme Court of the District did not pass on the legal effect of the two other acts. Upon the stipulated facts it ruled and found: (1) That Secretary Fall had jurisdiction to determine the known mineral character of section 36, without awaiting the trial by the local land office and appeals from the findings there made. (2) That the Secretary granted a hearing before himself for the purpose of determining the issues raised by the proceedings and gave notice to all parties in interest of such hearing. (3) That he had before him evidence which he had a right to consider and which supported his dismissal of the proceedings. (4) That he dismissed the proceedings after a consideration of the law and facts and directed that the parties in interest be notified of the dismissal and that the case be closed on the records. (5) That the order of dismissal was reduced to writing by his direction and was a judicial determination of the known mineral character of the land on January 26, 1903. (6) That the order of dismissal reduced to writing was a judgment on the merits, and its correctness could not be questioned by collateral proceedings, except for fraud. A decree for a permanent injunction was entered. That decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District. Work v. Standard Oil Co., 57 App. D. C. 329, 23 F. (2d) 750. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n276 \nU.S. 613\n, 48 S. Ct. 325.\n Ordinarily, where an act granting public lands excludes those known to be mineral, the determination of the fact whether a particular tract is of that character rests with the Secretary of the Interior. See Cameron v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 450, 464\n, 40 S. Ct. 410 (64 L. Ed. 659); Burke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., \n234 \nU.S. 669, 684\n, 687 S., 34 S. Ct. 907 (58 L. Ed. 1527). But compare Dunbar Lime Co. v. Utah-Idaho Sugar Co. (C. C. A.) 17 F.( 2d) 351. If such act provides for the issue of a patent, whether it be to pass the title or to furnish evidence that it has passed, the patent imports that final determination of the nonmineral character of the land has been made. The issue of \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 212]\n\u00a0\n the patent terminates the jurisdiction of the Department over the land. See Barden v. Northern Pacific R. R., \n154 \nU.S. 288, 327\n, 331 S., 14 S. Ct. 1030 (38 L. Ed. 992); Courtright v. Wisconsin Central R. R. Co., 19 L. D. 410; Heirs of C. H. Creciat, 40 L. D. 623. And in the courts the patent is accepted, upon a collateral attack, as affording conclusive evidence of the nonmineral character. St Louis Smelting & Refining Co. v. , kemp, \n104 \nU.S. 636, 640\n, 641 S. (26 L. Ed. 875); Barden v. Northern Pacific R. R. \n154 \nU.S. 288, 327\n, 14 S. Ct. 1030 (38 L. Ed. 992). Similarly, if the granting act provides for other action by the Secretary equivalent to a patent, such as approval of a list of the lands, the approval ends the jurisdiction of the Department, Cole v. Washington, 37 L. D. 387; Sewell A. Knapp, 47 L. D. 152; and it, likewise, imports that the necessary determination has been made. Chandler v. Calumet & Hecla Mining Co., \n149 \nU.S. 79\n, 13 S. Ct. 798. Compare Fred S. Porter, 50 L. D. 528, 533. Even where the granting act does not require either the issue of a patent to the grantee or such equivalent action, the Secretary may have occasion to make a determination of the known mineral character of the land, as when rights adverse to the grantee are asserted under the mineral, leasing or other laws. See Work v. Braffet, \n276 \nU.S. 560\n, 48 S. Ct. 363; Albert E. Dorff, 50 L. D. 219; Utah v. Lichliter, 50 L. D. 231; George G. Frandsen, 50 L. D. 516. In such event, the issue of the patent, or other instrument evidencing title, likewise imports that the determination has been made. Steel v. St. Louis Smelting & Refining Co., \n106 \nU.S. 447, 451\n, 1 S. Ct. 389 (27 L. Ed. 226). Compare State of Louisiana, 30 L. D. 626. For, in every such case, the determination of the mineral character is a prerequisite to the authority exercised in the performance of a duty imposed. St. Louis Smelting & Refining Co. v. Kemp, \n104 \nU.S. 636, 640\n, 641 S. (26 L. Ed. 875).\n The Standard Oil Company contends that Secretary Fall determined that the land was not known to be mineral on January 26, 1903; and that this determination in the informal hearing before him was legally an equivalent of a determination of the fact in formal proceedings be- \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 213]\n\u00a0\n fore the Register and Receiver under Circular No. 460. We agree that, if Secretary Fall had determined as a fact that the land was not then known to be mineral, his order dismissing the proceedings would have had the same legal effect as if it had followed the more formal procedure prescribed by Circular No. 460. For the Secretary is not obliged to employ proceedings in the local land office as the means for making the determination as to the known mineral character. He could himself hear the evidence in the first instance. Nor is he obliged, in so ascertaining the facts, to follow a procedure similar to that prescribed for the local land office. See Knight v. U. S. Land Association, 14i U. S. 161, 177, 178, 12 S. Ct. 258 (35 L. Ed. 974). We assume, without deciding, that, if Secretary Fall had determined as a fact that the land was not known to be mineral on January 26, 1903, his order dismissing the proceedings would have ended the jurisdiction of the Department over the land. And this determination would ordinarily be conclusive on the courts, even if there were demonstrable error in the admission, or appreciation of evidence. See Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 U.S. 330\n, 340 (23 L. Ed. 424); Lee v. Johnson, \n116 \nU.S. 48, 49\n, 6 S. Ct. 249 (29 L. Ed. 570). But we are of the opinion that Secretary Fall did not make a determination of that fact.\n Secretary Fall's order is embodied in a letter sent by his direction to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, which, after referring to the proceedings before the Register and Receiver, says:\n'The transferees of the State of California, representatives of the Department of Justice, and of the Navy Department appeared before Secretary Fall on June 8, 1921, and presented the matter orally, whereupon, after consideration of the law and facts involved, the Secretary verbally directed that the proceedings be dismissed. You are therefore authorized and directed to dismiss the proceedings against the State of California and its transferees in re said secs. 16 and 36. Notify all parties in interest of the dismissal and close the case upon your records.' \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 214]\n\u00a0\n The letter embodying Secretary Fall's direction to dismiss the proceedings does not state why he did so. The company argues that the dismissal was an order judicial in its nature; that in form the order is a judgment on the merits; that this judgment conclusively implies a finding of the fact that the land was not known to be mineral at the date of the apporval of the survey; and that no evidence is admissible to contradict what the order imports. It may be assumed that the hearing was conducted in the judicial manner; that it was what is often called a quasijudicial proceeding. But the order of dismissal is not a judgment. \n4\n Compare Dickson v. Luck Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 371, 374\n, 37 S. Ct. 167 (61 L. Ed. 371). It was an administrative act. And, unlike such administrative acts as a patent or the approval of a list of lands pursuant to a duty imposed upon the Secretary, the order of dismissal does not carry the implication that all determinations essential to the passing of title have been made. Since it does not, there may be inquiry in pais to ascertain whether Secretary Fall actually made such a determination. To that end the occurrences leading up to the entry of the order of dismissal may be examined. Compare Parcher v. Gillen, 26 L. D. 34; Harkrader v. Goldstein, 31 L. D. 87.\n\n In the oral argument of counsel for the company, in this court, there was perhaps a suggestion that Secretary Fall actually passed upon the known mineral character of the land as of January 26, 1903, when the survey was approved. But no such contention is made in the brief filed here. And, when the occurrences which preceded the making of the order are examined, it becomes clear that Secretary Fall made no determination of the contested issue of \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 215]\n\u00a0\n fact which was to be the subject of a hearing before the local officers if he deemed the issue material. He rested his order of dismissal on a supposed rule of law; holding, on the admitted facts, that the actual known mineral character on January 26, 1903, was not of legal significance. In so ruling, he yielded to the argument of counsel for the Standard Oil Company, who insisted that the then known mineral character had become immaterial, because the government was estopped, by action taken prior to 1921, from questioning the company's title. The brief filed by counsel with Secretary Fall prior to his granting the hearing, the notice of the proposed hearing before Secretary Fall on June 8, 1921, given by the Department to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Navy, and the stenographic report of that hearing, establish that this was the only matter considered by Secretary Fall.\n That brief was entitled an 'argument in support of the request that the Secretary of the Interior decide that in view of the previous action of the department and of its regulations in force in January, 1903, the title to said section is vested in the State of California or its grantees.' 5 The notice recited that the Standard Oil Company and the Pan American Oil Company, had 'asked to be heard orally in the matter of proposed proceeding by the Government to determine whether or not said section passed to the State of California under its school grant.' The hearing \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 216]\n\u00a0\n consisted of an oral statement by counsel for the company, interrupted from time to time by questions or remarks. The statement was not a recital of evidence in support of the factual assertion that the land was not known to be mineral on January 26, 1903. It was an argument in support of the legal proposition that the proceedings should be closed without deciding that issue of fact, because certain rules of law, arising from past action of the Department, as well as controlling equities, estopped the government from denying that the title had passed. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[278 U.S. 200, 217]\n\u00a0\n The conclusion that Secretary Fall did not determine the known mineral character of the land on January 26, 1903, is alone consistent with the stipulated facts. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n Most significant among the stipulated facts is the following: 'It was the contention of the transferees from the State, with which contention Assistant Secretary Finney disagreed at the hearing, that it could serve no pur- \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 218]\n\u00a0\n pose to take evidence in the local land office to determine the question whether or not said section or the lands adjacent thereto showed structural and geological conditions indicative in 1903 of the existence of oil on said section under conditions justifying developments therefor for the reason that said questions presented an immaterial question of fact and said question was not argued or discussed at the proceedings held on June 8, 1921, or at any conferences prior thereto between the representatives of the transferees and the Secretary of the Interior or the First Assistant Secretary of the Interior, except as shown in the brief and in the transcript of proceedings.' (The stenographic report of the hearing above referred to.)\n Thus, Secretary Fall did not hear evidence or make a determination on the issue of fact as to the known mineral character of the land within the meaning of the decisions in Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236\n, 34 S. Ct. 507, and United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n251 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 47, and this because he deemed the fact in issue of no legal significance. It is true that, in making the ruling of law that the Standard Oil Company's title was unassailable, the Secretary undertook to pass upon the merits of its claim to the land. For he concluded that, because of the conceded facts, urged by the company's counsel as creating an estoppel, the United States was precluded from questioning the title of the state and its transferees. But that decision could not end the jurisdiction of the Department, unless Congress conferred upon the Secretary of the Interior authority to determine the validity of the company's claim to the land, as a matter of law, without passing upon the contested issue of fact. To that question we now address ourselves.\n Where, by the terms of an act, the Secretary is required, upon application of the claimant, to issue a patent, as in Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 18 S. Ct. 208 (42 L. Ed. 591), or to certify a list, as in Frasher v. O'Connor, \n115 U.S. 102\n, \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 219]\n\u00a0\n 115, 116, 5 S. Ct. 1141 (29 L. Ed. 311), or to approve a location for a right of way, as in Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165\n, 13 S. Ct. 271, or to make a survey and approve a selection, as in Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 U.S. 312\n, 1, S. Ct. 632, Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 \nU.S. 312\n, 18 S. Ct. 632, upon the Secretary the power to make all determinations of law as well as of fact which are essential to the performance of the duty specifically imposed. After issue of the patent or other like instrument, his findings of facts are conclusive, in the absence of fraud or mistake, not only upon the Department, but upon the courts, De Cambra v. Rogers, \n189 \nU.S. 119\n, 23 S. Ct. 519; Love v. Flahive, \n205 \nU.S. 195, 198\n, 27 S. Ct. 486 (51 L. Ed. 768); and, though his rulings on matters of law are reviewable in the courts, Doolan v. Carr, \n125 \nU.S. 618, 625\n, 8 S. Ct. 1228 (31 L. Ed. 844); Wisconsin Central R. R. v. Forsythe, \n159 \nU.S. 46, 61\n, 15 S. Ct. 1020 (40 L. Ed. 71), they are not subject to re-examination by the Department. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 83, 84 (20 L. Ed. 485). For in making such determinations he acts as a special tribunal with judicial functions. Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 \nU.S. 316, 324\n, 23 S. Ct. 698 (47 L. Ed. 1074).\n But here no similar affirmative duty rested upon the Secretary to the performance of which the determination of the question of law was incidental. Secretary Fall owed no active duty to the state or to any other claimant. His duty in respect to the land was solely that owed to the United States-the duty to preserve its interests therein. The inquiry directed to be made in the local land office had been ordered by a predecessor solely in the performance of that duty. If as a result of the inquiry it should be found that the land was known to be mineral, the government would, if necessary, bring legal proceedings for possession and for damages or an accounting. If it should be found that the land was not known to be mineral, there would be no occasion for any further departmental action. Secretary Fall had, of course, the power to vacate the order of his predecessor that the Register and Receiver proceed with the investigation. For it is within the dis- \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 220]\n\u00a0\n cretion of every Secretary to decide what investigations he shall pursue in the public interest; and so Secretary is obliged to continue an inquiry which he believes to be futile. But the question here is whether he can, by action other than the final determination of fact, preclude resumption of the inquiry in the Department, and thereby vest the title of known mineral land in the state.\n We think that Congress did not confer upon the Secretary of the Interior the power to pass generally upon the right of the state to the land. When the Secretary has the duty to issue a patent or to furnish other evidence of title of a claimant, he must have authority to determine the questions of law incident to the performance of that duty. Litchfield v. The Register, 9 Wall. 575, 577, 578 (19 L. Ed. 681). But here no such duty rested upon him. Compare Louisiana v. Garfield, \n211 \nU.S. 70, 77\n, 29 S. Ct. 31 (53 L. Ed. 92). Authority to determine as a fact the known mineral character of the lands falls naturally to the Secretary as 'the supervising agent of the government to do justice to all claimants and preserve the rights of the people of the United States' to public lands. Knight v. U. S. Land Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 178\n, 12 S. Ct. 258, 262 ( 35 L. Ed. 974). But that authority does not carry the power to relinquish the jurisdiction of the Department over the land without determining, as a fact, that it was nonmineral at the time of the approval of the survey. Compare Work v. Louisiana, \n269 \nU.S. 250, 261\n, 46 S. Ct. 92 (70 L. Ed. 259 ). The broad power of control and supervision conferred upon the Secretary 'does not clothe him with any discretion to enlarge or curtail the rights of the grantee, nor to substitute his judgment for the will of Congress as manifested in the granting act.' Payne v. Central Pacific Railway Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 236\n, 41 S. Ct. 314, 316 (65 L. Ed. 598). See, also, Burfenning v. Chicago, St. Paul, etc., Ry., \n163 \nU.S. 321\n, 16 S. Ct. 1018. Daniels v. Wagner, \n237 \nU.S. 547, 558\n, 35 S. Ct. 740 (59 L. Ed. 1102, L. R. A. 1916A, 1116, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 40). To read into the legislation, under such circumstances, authority to pass upon the state's claim of right to the land, regardless of its known mineral character, would create, by implication, \n\n[278 U.S. 200, 221]\n\u00a0\n a power in direct contravention of the expressed intention of Congress that mineral lands were not granted to the state. Thus the Secretary would be constituted an agent rather for relinquishing than for preserving the rights of the United States in the public lands. See Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 338 S., 18 S. Ct. 632 (42 L. Ed. 1050).\n When Secretary Fall undertook to determine, not as a fact whether the land was known to be mineral in 1903, but as a proposition of law that, because of other conceded facts, the company's title had become unassailable, he acted without authority; and the order of dismissal based thereon did not remove the land from the jurisdiction of the Department.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Joint Hearings before Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys and House Committee on Public Lands on S. 3078 and H.

See 52 L. D. 51-54. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This action was taken after a joint resolution of Congress, dated February 21, 1924, 43 Stat. 15. It is conceded that this fact has no legal significance in the case. The basis on which Secretary Work proceeded is shown in his decision reported in 51 L. D. 141. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Department has repeatedly ruled that its decisions are not to be controlled by the same strict doctrine of res judicata which obtains as to judgments of the courts. Osborn v. Knight, 23 L. D. 216, 218; Joseph Pretzel, 24 L. D. 64, 65; Ernest B. Gates, 41 L. D. 384. Compare Howard A. Robinson, 43 L. D. 221. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The brief states: 'There is no reason why this decision as to the title of the State should not be made now without putting the State to the enormous and costly burden of proof, such as was in issue in the Elk Hills case. United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n251 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 47. In other words, if the absence of clear proof of the mineral character of the section in 1903 in the shape of discovery of mineral was sufficient to characterize the lands as nonmineral under the regulations and repeated decisions of the department, it will make no difference that by the application of the principles of the Elk Hills case it could be successfully shown that the land within the reasoning of that decision was believed to be mineral land.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The prior action relied upon as vesting title in the state and its transferees was: (1) The fact that the land was classified as nonmineral in 1904, when, upon receipt of a report from Special Agent Ryan that it was nonmineral, it was relieved from suspension; (2) the fact that, on March 6, 1903, the Department adopted an administrative rule respecting school land grants that the state would not be permitted to make lieu selections based on the alleged mineral character of land within a school section, unless it proved that there had been actual discovery or exposure of mineral thereon. Mr. Sutro argued that, since under this rule the state could not have made the land the base for a lieu selection, it was legally entitled to retain it; and having acted on the rule, its transferees were unaffected by later decisions of this court (Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236\n, 34 S. Ct. 507; United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n255 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 47) inconsistent with the rule. In closing he said:\n'And I submit that in this case, where there is no fraud, no possible allegation of fraud, where the State, five years after the classification of this land, sold it in good faith to people who bought it in good faith, and who held it for 10 years, and who have now invested some millions of dollars in the land, that the time has passed when the United States can assert its title thereto, and that the United States is estopped by the judgment of this department that this was nonmineral land in 1904, and by its own regulations, which defined it as nonmineral land in 1903. Now if you will ask me what it is I am asking you to do, I will say it is this: I am asking the department to close this case on the ground that the title is in the State, and there is nothing further to investigate.' Secretary Fall then said: 'What you are asking now is that if convinced that the rule is as you state it, that instead of allowing this case to go to a hearing, and then in event I would hold with you, so deciding at that time, that if I am with you that I should decide it at this time and prevent the delay in the trial?' After some further discussion, Secretary Fall asked: 'Is Mr. Sutro's statement of the case practically admitted?' First Assistant Secretary Finney answered: 'I think that is substantially the case.' Whereupon the Secretary said: 'The contest will be dismissed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The land lies within Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1; a part of it is immediately adjacent to that involved in United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n251 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 47, which was rendered in 1919. The fact that the proceedings were pending was not discovered by the Chief of the Field Division of the Land Office until the close of 1920. In February, 1921, the importance of taking immediate action to protect supposed interests of the United States in the land was brought to the attention of the Department of Justice and the Secretary of the Navy. On March 2, 1921, the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the Register and Receiver and the Chief of the Field Division to take prompt action to determine by proper proceedings whether the land was known to be mineral at the date of the approval of the survey. The advisability of protecting the supposed interests of the government, pending that determination, by an application for a receiver and an injunction, was considered by the several departments. That course was deemed inadvisable. Conference with representatives of the company resulted in an agreement that it would endeavor to secure from the Department of the Interior an early hearing and determination with respect to the known mineral character of the land, that, until such determination, there should be no further development thereon, and that the government would not take any action in court. Thereafter, on several days prior to May 26, 1921, Mr. Oscar Sutro, representing the Standard Oil Company, presented to Secretary Fall and the First Assistant Secretary, a request for an early determination with respect to the title to section 36.

HENDERSON(1929)\nNo. 519\nArgued: April 17, 1929Decided: May 27, 1929\n\n\n\n Messrs. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., and John L. Tye, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellant.\n Mr. Reuben R. Arnold, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, Mary E. Henderson, sued to recover damages for the death of her husband. He was killed near Tunnell \n\n[279 U.S. 639, 640]\n\u00a0\n Hill, Ga., at a grade crossing of a public highway and appellant's railroad, in a collision between a motortruck that he was driving and one of appellant's railway trains. The jury returned a verdict for her, and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed in the Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court of the State.\n The question presented is whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated by section 2780 of the Georgia Civil Code. It follows: 'A railroad company shall be liable for any damages done to persons, stock, or other property by the running of the locomotives, or cars, or other machinery of such company, or for damage done by any person in the employment and service of such company, unless the company shall make it appear that their agents have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, the presumption in all cases being against the company.'\n Plaintiff's declaration charges that the collision and death were caused by negligence of defendant and its employees: In leaving the crossing in a dangerous condition; in failing to sound the whistle to give warning or to keep a lookout ahead as the train approached the crossing; in that defendant's employees, after they saw the truck upon the crossing, failed to stop the train but accelerated its speed; in running at a dangerous speed; in not having the train under control when approaching the crossing; in operating the train by a 'practically blind engineer.' The answer denied that defendant or any of its employees was guilty of negligence and alleged that deceased came to his death as a result of his own fault.\n Plaintiff proved that her husband was killed in the collision. She also offered some evidence of negligent maintenance and a dangerous condition of the crossing. And it necessarily appeared that the train failed to stop in time to avoid the collision. Plaintiff offered no evidence, and there was none in the case, to support her other alle- \n\n[279 U.S. 639, 641]\n\u00a0\n gations of negligence. Defendant offered much evidence tending to show that it and its employees exercised due care for the proper maintenance of the track and crossing and in the operation of the train, and that neither it nor any employee was guilty of any negligence charged.\n The court's charge included the following: 'When it has been made to appear that injury or damage has occurred by reason of the operation of the locomotive and train of cars of a railroad company, the presumption arises that the railroad company and its employees were negligent in each of the particulars specified in the plaintiff's petition, and the burden thereupon shifts to the railroad company to show that its employees exercised ordinary care and diligence in the particulars wherein they are alleged to have been negligent, and, unless it does so, the fact of the injury or damage having been made to appear, the plaintiff, suing for recovery of damages by reason of such injury, would be entitled to recover . ... The burden is upon the plaintiff in this case to establish her contentions by a preponderance of the evidence. That is subject to the qualification, already given you, that, when the fact of the killing has been made to appear, the presumption arises that the defendant company was negligent in each of the particulars specified in the petition, and the burden thereupon shifts to the defendant company to show that its employees exercised ordinary care and diligence in such particulars.'\n Upon the mere fact of collision and resulting death, the statute is held to raise a presumption that defendant and its employees were negligent in each of the particulars alleged, and that every act or omission in plaintiff's specifications of negligence was the proximate cause of the death, and it makes defendant liable unless it showed due care in respect of every matter alleged against it. And, by authorizing the jury, in the absence of evidence, to find negligence in the operation of the engine and train, the \n\n[279 U.S. 639, 642]\n\u00a0\n court necessarily permitted the presumption to be considered and weighed as evidence against the testimony of defendant's witnesses tending affirmatively to prove such operation was not negligent in any respect. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Appellee insists that section 2780 is valid, and argues that the presumption, being one established by statute, has the effect of evidence, and that it is for the jury to decide whether the company's evidence is sufficient to overcome the presumption; that 'it should not as a matter of law be dissipated the instant any testimony is taken against it,' and that the issue is to be determined on a consideration of all the evidence including the presumption.\n Legislation declaring that proof of one fact of group of facts shall constitute prima facie evidence of an ultimate fact in issue is valid if there is a rational connection between what is proved and what is to be inferred. A prima facie presumption casts upon the person against whom it is applied the duty of going forward with his evidence on the particular point to which the presumption relates. A statute creating a presumption that is arbitrary, or that operates to deny a fair opportunity to repel it, violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Legislative fiat may not take the place of fact in the judicial determination of issues involving life, liberty, or property. Manley v. Georgia, \n279 \nU.S. 1\n, 49 S. Ct. 215, 73 L. Ed. -, and cases cited.\n The mere fact of collision between a railway train and a vehicle at a highway grade crossing furnishes no basis \n\n[279 U.S. 639, 643]\n\u00a0\n for any inference as to whether the accident was caused by negligence of the railway company, or of the traveler on the highway, or of both, or without fault of any one. Reasoning does not lead from the occurrence back to its cause. And the presumption was used to support conflicting allegations of negligence. Plaintiff claimed that the engineer failed to keep a lookout ahead, that he did not stop the train after he saw the truck on the crossing, and that his eyesight was so bad that he could not see the truck in time to stop the train.\n Appellee relies principally upon Mobile, J. & K. C. R. R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463. That was an action in a court of Mississippi to recover damages for the death of a section foreman accidentally killed in that state. While engaged about his work he stood by the track to let a train pass; a derailment occurred and a car fell upon him. A statute of the state provided: '... Proof of injury inflicted by the running of the locomotives or cars of such (railroad) company shall be prima facie evidence of the want of reasonable skill and care on the part of the servants of the company in reference to such injury.' That provision was assailed as arbitrary and in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This court held it valid and said (page 43 of 219 U. S. (31 S. Ct. 138)). 'The only legal effect of this inference is to cast upon the railroad company the duty of producing some evidence to the contrary. When that is done the inference is at end, and the question of negligence is one for the jury upon all of the evidence. ... The statute does not ... fail in due process of law, because it creates a presumption of liability, since its operation is only to supply an inference of liability in the absence of other evidence contradicting such inference.' That case is essentially different from this one. Each of the state enactments raises a presumption from the fact of injury caused by the running of locomotives or cars. The Mississippi statute cre- \n\n[279 U.S. 639, 644]\n\u00a0\n ated merely a temporary inference of fact that vanished upon the introduction of opposing evidence. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co. v. Brown, 138 Miss. 39, 66, 102 So. 855 et seq.; Columbus & G. Ry. Co. v. Fondren, 145 Miss. 679, 110 So. 365. That of Georgia as construed in this case creates an inference that is given effect of evidence to be weighed against opposing testimony, and is to prevail unless such testimony is found by the jury to preponderate.\n The presumption raised by section 2780 is unreasonable and arbitrary, and violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Arnold, or Atlanta, Ga., for respondent. \n\n[278 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Ira L. Hughes, a traveling fireman, was killed on the Western & Atlantic Railroad while engaged in the performance of his duties. His widow, as administratrix brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) in a state court of Georgia. She recovered a verdict of $17,500, which was set aside as excessive by the presiding judge. At the second trial before another judge and jury a verdict was rendered for $10,000. A motion for a new trial was overruled. Judgment was entered on this verdict; and it was affirmed by the intermediate appellate court. The Supreme Court of the state refused a certiorari. This court granted the writ. \n278 \nU.S. 588\n, 49 S. Ct. 18, 73 L. Ed. -.\n Hughes was killed while riding on a locomotive moving in interstate commerce. The plaintiff claimed that he was knocked from the running board and thrown against an up-right on a bridge as the train entered it; that the accident resulted from an unusual rocking of the engine from side to side, due to the defective condition of the track leading to the bridge; that the railroad had been negligent in permitting the track to remain in bad condition; and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. The railroad claimed that the alleged cause of the accident was mere speculation. It denied that the track was in bad condition, denied that its condition had produced the alleged swaying of the locomotive, denied that it had been guilty of any negligence, insisted that the accident was the result of Hughes' gross negligence and his disobedience of the company's rules, claimed that he had assumed the risk, and requested a directed verdict. The request was denied.\n The railroad asserts that the scintilla of evidence rule prevails in Georgia, and argues that the lower courts erred by applying the local rule in this case. It is true \n\n[278 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n that submission to the jury of contested issues of fact is not required in the federal courts, if there is only a scintilla of evidence, Baltimore & Ohio R.

Ct. 169; that it is the duty of the judge to direct the verdict, when the testimony and all inference which the jury could justifiably draw therefrom would be insufficient to support a verdict for the other party, Elliott v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., \n150 \nU.S. 245\n, 14 S. Ct. 85; Small Co. v. Lamborn & Co., \n267 \nU.S. 248, 254\n, 45 S.

Allen, \n276 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 48 S. Ct. 215. We need not consider whether the rule prevailing in Georgia differs substantially from the federal rule. 1 For even under the federal rule it was proper to submit the case to the jury. The evidence introduced by the plaintiff was substantial; and was sufficient if believed, to sustain a verdict in her favor. There was much conflict in the evidence. The first trial occupied five days. At the second trial 33 witnesses testified. Some of the testimony given by witnesses for the railroad would, if believed, have entitled it to the verdict as a matter of law. Some of the testimony given by witnesses called by the plaintiff does not seem to us persuasive. But the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence were obviously matters for the jury. The defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict. \n\n[278 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n The railroad contends also that there was error in assessing the damages. It argues that nominal damages only were recoverable, since the plaintiff failed to introduce evidence either as to the proper method of computing the present value of the anticipated benefits or as to the rate of interest which should be applied in doing so. The evidence was ample. Among other things, there were mortality tables introduced by the plaintiff and annuity tables offered by the railroad-tables in which values were computed at both the 6 per cent. and the 7 per cent. rate. The railroad argues also that the charge failed to make it clear to the jury that, in computing the damages recoverable for the operation of future benefits, adequate allowance must be made, according to circumstances, for the earning power of money, that the verdict should be for the present value of the anticipated benefits, and that the legal rate of interest is not necessarily the rate to be applied in making the computation.

The defendant is a holder of stock of that Bank. This suit is brought to collect an assessment equal in amount to the par value of the defendant's stock, which was levied by the Federal Farm Loan Board and which the plaintiff was ordered to collect. The defendant demurred to the declaration that alleged these facts. The District Court sustained the demurrer and ordered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed and the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Greene v. Wheeler, 29 F.(2d) 468. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court to settle the question whether the Federal Farm Loan Board had power to levy an assessment, or the Receiver to maintain suit, for the enforcing of the stockholders' liability created by the Federal Farm Loan Act, July 17, 1916, c. 245,  16, 39 Stat. 374, U. S. Code, title 12,  812 (12 USCA  812).\n The section (section 29, U. S. Code, title 12,  961, 963 (12 USCA  961, 963)) of the Federal Farm Loan Act that deals with insolvency of farm loan associations and joint stock land banks provides for the appointment of a receiver by the Farm Loan Board and \n\n[280 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n states his duties and powers. It closely follows the words of the earlier National Bank Act., Rev. St.  5234, U. S. Code, tit. 12,  192 (12 USCA  192), stating the duties of the receiver of a bank that has refused to pay its circulating notes, and giving him power to take possession of books and assets and to collect debts, etc. But whereas the Bank Act goes on 'and may, if necessary to pay the debts of such association, enforce the individual liability of the stockholders,' the Farm Loan Act stops short and has no such words. When so important a grant of power contained in the prototype is left out from the copy it is almost impossible to attribute the omission to anything but design, or to believe that it left to very attenuated implications what the model before it so clearly expressed.\n There is a plain reason for the difference. The national banks issue notes that constitute an important part of the currency of the country and that the United States has an interest in seeing paid. It is upon the bank's refusal to pay these notes that the Comptroller of the Currency is to appoint a receiver, and the authority to enforce the stockholder's liability adds a security to the national circulation that is of national scope. But the Joint Stock Land Banks issue no such notes. They are created to make loans on farm mortgages to members of an association in a territorially limited district, and are relatively local affairs. It is contemplated that the bonds that they issue shall be secured by mortgages. There is not the same need that the stockholder's liability should be summarily disposed of behind his back in Washington (Rankin v. Barton, \n199 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 26 S. Ct. 29; Casey v. Galli, \n94 U.S. 673\n, 681) rather than by the v. Tubman, \n92 U.S. 156\n. The brought in the neighborhood, in which the stockholder can be heard, and by which the assessment instead of one hundred per cent. can be adjusted to the specific case. Terry v. Tubman, \n92 U.S. 156\n. The stockholders are to be held only 'equally and ratably.' \n\n[280 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n And, to say the least, the bill in equity is the most likely way of reaching that result.\n The establishment in Washington of a bureau 'charged with the execution of this Act, ... under the general supervision of a Federal Farm Loan Board,' Federal Farm Loan Act July 17, 1916, c. 245,  3, U. S. Code, title 12,  651 (12 USCA  651), and the putting of the administration of the act under the direction and control of that Board by section 1 (12 USCA  641), seem to us inadequate to supply the omission of this power from the express statement of what the Board and receiver may do when the bank is insolvent. The receiver had power to collect the assets of the bank, but the libility of stockholders is no part of those assets. It is a liability to creditors which the creditors may be left to enforce.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE RIVER LUMBER CO. v. ARKANSAS EX REL.

Rose and George Vaughan, both of Little Rock, Ark., for defendant in error. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 693]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves a question as to the constitutional validity of the back tax law of Arkansas. Section 1 of Act No. 169, p. 724 of the Arkansas Acts of 1913-which is set forth in the margin1-provides that where, because of any inadequate or insufficient valuation or assessment, or undervaluation, of any property which belonged to any corporation at the time taxes thereon should have been properly assessed and paid, there are overdue and unpaid taxes thereon owing to the State or a political subdivision thereof by any corporation, the Attorney General shall institute a suit in chancery in the name of the State for the collection thereof. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 694]\n\u00a0\n In July, 1925, the State of Arkansas, proceeding under this section brought suit in a chancery court, on the relation of the Attorney General, against the White River Lumber Company, a foreign corporation doing business in the State, for the recovery of back taxes. The complaint, as amended, alleged that the Company owned large tracts of valuable timber lands in four counties of the State,2 which were worth from $30 to $50 an acre but had been undervalued and underassessed for taxation for the years 1915 to 1926, inclusive, at a valuation of about $4 per acre; and prayed judgment for overdue and unpaid taxes for those years at 50 per cent of their true value-the basis of valuation that had been fixed by an order of the State Tax Commission-less the assessments actually made. The Company, answering, denied that there had been any undervaluation; claimed that the lands had been valued on the same basis as like timber lands owned by other individuals and corporations; and alleged that section 1 of the law as attempted to be enforced against it, was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The chancery court-finding that for the years in question the value of the lands constituting the 'Big Island group,'3 was $50 an acre, and that of the remaining lands $33.33 an acre, and that the average assessments of other lands in these counties had been at approximately 30 per cent of their value-back assessed the Big Island group at $15 per acre, and the other lands at $10 per acre, less credits for timber stolen and sold and the valuations at which they had been originally assessed; and, declared a lien on the several tracts for the amount of the back taxes due on them, respectively, as thus reassessed.\n Upon cross appeals the Supreme Court held that the fact that the statute authorizing suits for back taxes \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 695]\n\u00a0\n applied only to corporations, did not render it repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment; that under it the State might maintain suit to recover additional taxes on the ground that there had been an inadequate or insufficient valuation or assessment of the corporate property; that in such case the reassessment should be on the same basis as that upon which the original and inadequate assessment should have been made; and that as it appeared that all other property was assessed at an average of 30 per cent of its value, the Company's lands, under the uniformity clause of the State Constitution, should be assessed at that per cent, despite the fact that the State Commission had fixed a higher basis. Applying these rules of law the court found from the testimony that it was not shown that there had been any inadequate or insufficient valuation of any of the lands except the Big Island group, but that this group was a body of lands that were unusually well timbered, had a value not possessed by the other timbered lands which were assessed at from $4 to $5 per acre, and 'were of an average value, during the entire time covered by the assessments in question, of $40 per acre, taking into account the timber stolen and the timber sold.' And holding that they should be assessed at a valuation of 30 per cent of that amount, that is, $12 per acre, less the valuation on which the taxes had been paid, the decree of the chancery court was modified so as to permit a recovery of back taxes on the Big Island group only, and on those lands only to the extent indicated. 175 Ark. 956, 2 S.W.( 2d) 25.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged here that the back tax act of Arkansas, in providing for the reassessment of property of corporations by judicial proceedings and the imposition of additional taxes thereon after the payment of the taxes assessed by the duly constituted assessing authorities, and in not providing for such reassessment of property belonging to natural persons, denies to the Company and other \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 696]\n\u00a0\n corporations the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We cannot sustain this contention. It is unquestioned that the Arkansas statutes providing for the original assessment of property for taxation make no distinction between the lands of corporations and those of natural persons and that it is the duty of the assessing officers to assess them in like manner, according to their value. And the question now presented is merely whether a statute authorizing the collection of back taxes on lands which have escaped their just burden of taxation, is invalid because it is limited to the recovery of additional taxes on the lands of corporations which have been assessed at an inadequate or insufficient valuation, and does not extend to the recovery of such additional taxes on the lands of natural persons, which may likewise have been assessed at an inadequate or insufficient valuation. The decision in Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553, on which the Company chiefly relies, involved merely a question as to the invalidity of the discrimination made by a statute levying an original tax on the gross receipts derived by corporations from their operation of taxicabs. As there was no question whatever as to back taxes and no back tax act was involved, the decision is not controlling in the present case.\n In Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 370\n, 47 S. Ct. 641, 646 (71 L. Ed. 1095), we said-citing various cases-that: 'A statute does not violate the equal protection clause merely because it is not all-embracing . ... A State may properly direct its legislation against what it deems an existing evil without covering the whole field of possible abuses. ... The statute must be presumed to be aimed at an evil where experience shows it to be most felt, and to be deemed by the legislature coextensive with the practical need; and is not to be overthrown merely because other instances may be suggested to which also it might have been applied; that being a \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 697]\n\u00a0\n matter for the legislature to determine unless the case is very clear . ... It is not open to objection unless the classification is so lacking in any adequate or reasonable basis as to preclude the assumption that it was made in the exercise of the legislative judgment and discretion.' These and like principles have been applied by this Court in four cases dealing directly with classifications made in back tax statutes and similar legislation.\n In Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526, 539\n, 16 S. Ct. 83, 88 (40 L. Ed. 247), in which it was held that a state statute providing for the collection of back taxes on real property without including a like provision for collecting back taxes on personal property, should be sustained, the Court said: 'The case is different from that of an ordinary tax law in which there may be some foundation for the claim that the legislature is expected to make no discrimination. ... For this statute rests on the assumption that, generally speaking, all property subject to taxation has been reached and aims only to provide for those accidents which may happen under any system of taxation, in consequence of which here and there some item of property has escaped its proper burden; and it may well be that the legislature in view of the probabilities of changes in the title or situs of personal property might deem it unwise to attempt to charge it with back taxes, while at the same time, by reason of the stationary character of real estate, it might elect to proceed against that. At any rate, if it did so it would violate no provision of the Federal Constitution. ...'\n In New York State v. Barker, \n179 \nU.S. 279, 285\n, 21 S. Ct. 121, a general state statute imposed a tax on the real estate of individuals and corporations upon its full and true value as found by the assessors. In the case of individuals no resort was permitted to any other proceeding by which the tax could be increased by any subsequent assessment on the difference between the assessed and the actual value. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 698]\n\u00a0\n But in the case of corporations, if real estate should be mistakenly assessed at an undervaluation another statute afforded an opportunity to reach the difference between the assessed and actual value by making an assessment upon the actual value of the corporate capital, including the real estate. The only claim was that 'in this opportunity to correct a mistaken assessment upon its real estate in the case of a corporation when assessed upon its capital, which does not exist in the case of an individual, the corporation is denied the equal protection of the laws.' In overruling this contention the court said: 'The mere fact that the law gives the assessors in the case of corporations two chances to arrive at a correct valuation of their real estate, when they have but one in the case of individuals, cannot be held to be a denial to the corporations of the equal protection of the laws, so long as the real estate of the individual is, in fact, generally assessed at its full value.'\n In Florida Central & P. R. Co. v. Reynolds, \n183 \nU.S. 471, 480\n, 22 S. Ct. 176, 180 (46 L. Ed. 283) in which it was held that in so far as the Federal Constitution was concerned the legislature had the power to compel the collection of delinquent taxes from railroad companies for certain years, even though it made no provision for the collection of delinquent taxes for those years on other property, the Court, quoting with approval from the Winona Land Co. Case, said: 'If the State, as has been seen, has the power, in the first instance, to classify property for taxation, it has the same right of classification as to property which in past years has escaped taxation. We must assume that the legislature acts according to its judgment for the best interests of the State. A wrong intent can not be imputed to it. It may have found that the railroad delinquent tax was large, and the delinquent tax on other property was small and not worth the trouble of special provision therefor. If \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 699]\n\u00a0\n taxes are to be regarded as mere debts, then the effort of the State to collect from one debtor is not prejudiced by its failure to make like effort to collect from another. And if regarded in the truer light as a contribution to the support of government, then it does not lie in the mouth of one called upon to make his contribution to complain that some other person has not been coerced into a like contribution.'\n In Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532, 534\n, 40 S. Ct. 304, the State, proceeding under the statute here involved, had brought suit against a corporation to recover back taxes alleged to be due upon a proper valuation of its capital stock by reason of the fact that in assessing its value there had been omitted the value of stock owned by the corporation in two other corporations, each of which had paid full taxes. The corporation defended 'on the ground that individuals are not taxed for such stock or subject to suit for back taxes, and that the taxation is double, setting up the Fourteenth Amendment.' This Court, in overruling the defense 'with regard to confining the recovery of back taxes to those due from corporations,' said: 'It is to be presumed, until the contrary appears, that there were reasons for more strenuous efforts to collect admitted dues from corporations than in other cases, and we cannot pronounce it an unlawful policy on the part of the State. See New York State v. Barker, \n179 U.S. 279\n, 283, (21 S. Ct. 121).'\n We see no ground for distinguishing the Ft. Smith Lumber Co. Case from that now under consideration, and on that authority and for the reasons stated therein and in the earlier cases which we have cited, hold that the back tax statute of Arkansas, although confined to the property of corporations, does not deny to them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 2. \nIt is also urged in behalf of the Company, that even if the back tax statute be valid on its face, it was so \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 700]\n\u00a0\n applied by the Supreme Court of the State in the present case, by selecting thirty-four tracts of land, constituting the Big Island group, and reassessing the same on the basis of their average value for twelve years on an average basis of assessment instead of assessing them in accordance with the Arkansas statutes according to the actual value of each separate tract for each separate year on the actual basis of assessment for that year, as to constitute a denial of the equal protection of the laws. It does not appear, however, from the record that this constitutional question was presented in or passed upon by the Supreme Court of the State; and as it was sought to raise this question for the first time by assignments of error in this Court it is necessarily excluded from our consideration. Whitney v. California, supra, 361 of 274 U. S. (47 S. Ct. 641), and cases therein cited.\n\n 3. \nNo other federal question is presented by the record for our consideration. The decree is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n Plaintiff in error attacks a provision of an Arkansas statute,4 on the ground that it is repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 701]\n\u00a0\n It directs that, where because of undervaluation there are overdue and unpaid taxes upon any property which belonged to a corporation at the time such taxes should have been assessed and paid, the Attorney General shall bring a suit to collect them unless the title passes to an individual before suit. No law of the state creates or permits the enforcement of any like or similar liability against the property of individuals. The fact that the property is owned by a corporation is the sole basis of the classification. The claim here is for additional taxes upon land, and the land alone is liable. The owner cannot be held for either the original or back taxes. See decision below, 175 Ark. 956, 973, 2 S.W.(2d) 25. Like lands of individuals are shown to have been grossly underassessed. And if such lands were owned by corporations, they would be liable for back taxes.\n The discrimination is deliberate. The statute, passed in 1887, is entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of overdue taxes from corporations doing business in this state.' It was amended in 1913. In State ex rel. Attorney General v. K. C. & M. Ry. & Bridge Co., 117 Ark. 606, page 613, 174 S. W. 248, 252, the court said: 'The object of the amendatory act of 1913 was to give a complete remedy for the \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 702]\n\u00a0\n recovery of back taxes due by a corporation upon any property then in the state, which belonged to any corporation at the time such taxes should have been properly assessed and paid. It takes away the right conferred by the original act to proceed against property where the title had passed to an individual, although it had been owned by a corporation when the assessment was made and the taxes were payable. ...' And see concurring opinion, State ex rel. Attorney General v. Bodcaw Lumber Co., 128 Ark. 505, 523, 194 S. W. 692.\n This suit was brought in 1925; its original purpose was to recover from plaintiff in error additional taxes, for each of the 10 years ending with 1924, on the value of the company's 'capital stock or intangible property.' The complaint stated that plaintiff in error had paid taxes upon its real and personal property. It alleged that the assessed value of its tangible property 'upon which defendant had actually paid taxes as provided by statute' was much less than the market value of its capital stock, and judgment was demanded against plaintiff in error for back taxes on such intangibles.\n But it was found that the company had no property in Arkansas other than real estate, and about the same time the state supreme court, in State v. Lion Oil & Refining Co. (1926) 171 Ark. 209, 284 S. W. 33, held that the capital stock of a foreign corporation which is neither located or used within the state cannot be taxed therein.\n Then the complaint was amended to allege that the company owned timber lands in Arkansas which had been underassessed in each of the 12 years ending with 1926. The chancery court charged the lands with back taxes. The supreme court held that there had been undervaluation of only a part of the company's lands and that the amount of back taxes imposed by the decree should be reduced accordingly. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 703]\n\u00a0\n Such taxes are imposed upon the sole ground that through mistake the original assessments were too low. The procedure for the enforcement of taxes on land is not affected by the character of the owner; the state looks only to the land. Lands of individuals are as likely to be erroneously undervalued as are those belonging to corporations. But the law directs the Attorney General to collect back taxes not in all cases where the taxes originally levied and paid were based on undervaluation, but only where property belongs to corporations at the time of the assessment and also at time of suit. He is not permitted to bring suit to make such collections against lands owned by individuals even if they were owned by corporations when undertaxed. As here applied, the Act singles out the lands of a corporation, leaving those of natural persons free from such claims. Transfer to an individual, whenever made, prevents the operation of the act.\n This case cannot be distinguished from Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553. There the tax in controversy was imposed upon the corporation's gross receipts derived from the operation of taxicabs. But the gross receipts of individuals in the same line of business were not taxed. And for that reason the law was held repugnant to the equal protection clause. The court said (page 402 of 277 U. S. (48 S. Ct. 555)): 'Here the tax is one that can be laid upon receipts belonging to a natural person quite as conveniently as upon those of a corporation. It is not peculiarly applicable to corporations, as are taxes on their capital stock or franchises. ... The character of the owner is the sole fact on which the distinction and discrimination are made to depend. The tax is imposed merely because the owner is a corporation. The discrimination is not justified by any difference ... in the situation or character of the property employed.' It is not pretended that such back taxes on lands of individuals may not be imposed as con- \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 704]\n\u00a0\n veniently as upon those of corporations. The Arkansas law imposes a tax liability on lands of a corporation to which lands of an individual are not subjected. That case rules this one.\n But there are cited in support of the decision below Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526\n, 16 S. Ct. 83, New York State v. Barker, \n179 \nU.S. 279, 285\n, 21 S. Ct. 121, Florida Central & P. R. Co. v. Reynolds, \n183 \nU.S. 471, 480\n, 22 S. Ct. 176, and Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532, 534\n, 40 S. Ct. 304.\n Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, supra, did not present any question under the equal protection clause. A state law provided generally for the assessment and taxation of both real and personal property which had been omitted from the tax roll. Lands of the company were assessed under the act. It insisted (page 528 of 159 U. S. (16 S. Ct. 84)) that the act violated the contract clause and the due process clause.\n In support of the latter contention, the company argued that, as to back taxes on personal property, the act was invalid because it failed to provide for notice to owners before the charges were fixed against them; that it could not be assumed that the legislature would attempt to enforce back taxes against lands alone, and that therefore the whole act fell. But the state court declined to pass upon that contention, County of Redwood v. Winona & St. Peter Land Co., 40 Minn. 512, 521, 42 N. W. 473, and held that in any event back taxes on personal property might be enforced by an ordinary personal action. This court said (page 539 of 159 U. S. (16 S. Ct. 88)): 'It seems to us ... that the assumption that it cannot be believed that the Legislature would never seek to provide for the collection of back taxes on real property without at the same time including therein a like provision for collecting back taxes on personal property, cannot be sustained. The case is different from that of an ordinary tax law in which there may be some foundation for the claim that the Legislature is expected \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 705]\n\u00a0\n to make no discrimination, and would not attempt to provide for the collection of taxes on one kind of property without also making provision for collection of taxes on all other property equally subject to taxation . ... And it may well be that the Legislature in view of the probabilities of changes in the title or situs of personal property might deem it unwise to attempt to charge it with back taxes, while at the same time, by reason of the stationary character of real estate, it might elect to proceed against that.' The court concluded that in any event it was for the state court to determine whether the act was severable.\n Both in Minnesota and Arkansas, taxes and back taxes on personal property are enforceable against the owner; taxes and back taxes on land are enforced only against the land. The Minnesota act did not attempt to make any classification. Moreover, a discrimination between personal property and land is essentially different from that attempted by the Arkansas statute. The equal protection clause does not require that, for purposes of taxation, land must be put in the class with merchandise, moneys, credits, livestock and other personal property. The differences in kind are sufficient to warrant classification.\n In New York State v. Barker, supra, the controversy concerned an assessment of a corporation's capital stock. It was a proceeding against the corporation itself. There was no question in the case of increasing, reassessing or collecting taxes on land. The real estate of corporations and individuals was directly assessed, and the law required this assessment to be at actual value. In addition, there was imposed on corporations a capital stock tax, to be determined by deducting from total value of all its property, tangible and intangible, its debts and the assessed value of real estate, the remainder to be taxed as capital stock. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 706]\n\u00a0\n The taxing officers found the 'actual value' of real estate to be $ 965,000 and added other property, making total gross assets, $1,095,049; they deducted debts, $329,050, and 'assessed value' of real estate, $600, 000, leaving $165,999, to be taxed as capital stock. The corporation insisted that in determining total gross assets the assessed value of the real estate should be substituted for its actual value; that would leave nothing to be taxed as capital stock.\n Its contention was that the taking of its real estate at actual value instead of assessed value denied to it equal protection of the laws. This court pointed out (page 284 of 179 U. S. (21 S. Ct. 123)) that the failure to assess the company's real estate at its actual value for separate taxation and the use of actual value to ascertain the capital stock tax could work no denial of equal protection if the real estate of individuals was in fact assessed at its full and true value as required by law. And it said: 'There is no allegation ... that there has been any undervaluation of real estate, either with regard to individuals or corporations. ...' Page 285 (21 S. Ct. 123). 'But we are ... asked ... in the absence of allegations or proof of habitual, or indeed of any undervaluation, to assume or take judicial notice of its existence, notwithstanding such undervaluation would constitute a clear violation of the law of the state . ...' Page 286 (21 S. Ct. 124). 'Whether, if the case were proved, as assumed by counsel, it would in fact amount to any such discrimination against corporations as to work a denial to the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws, is a question not raised by this record, and, therefore, not necessary to be decided.' It requires no discussion to show that this case is not in point.\n Florida Central & P. Railroad Co. v. Reynolds, Supra, considered a Florida statute providing for collection of back taxes on railroad properties. The single question was (page 474 of 183 U. S. (22 S. Ct. 177)) whether to reach backward and collect taxes \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 707]\n\u00a0\n from certain kinds of property without also making provision for collecting taxes on other kinds of property transgressed the equal protection clause. It was held, as is well understood, that railroads so differ from other kinds of property that they may be separately classified. The case has no bearing here.\n In Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, supra, the suit was to enforce an obligation of the corporation itself and not merely a claim for taxes against its land. The company in that case owned stock in two other Arkansas corporations and claimed it was entitled to omit such shares from the taxable value of its own stock. It defended on the ground that individuals are not taxed on such stock or subject to suits for back taxes. The court said: 'If the state of Arkansas wished to discourage but not to forbid the holding of stock in one corporation by another and sought to attain the result by this tax, or if it simply saw fit to make corporations pay for the privilege, there would be nothing in the Constitution to hinder. ... The same is true with regard to confining the recovery of back taxes to those due from corporations. It is to be presumed, until the contrary appears, that there were reasons for more strenuous efforts to collect admitted dues from corporations than in other cases, and we cannot pronounce it an unlawful policy on the part of the state.'\n This court assumed that the special burden was imposed in pursuit of a definite purpose on the part of the state in respect of incorporated owners of stock in Arkansas corporations. That decision rests upon the ground that the tax was peculiarly applicable to corporations. But a tax on land is not.\n As the back taxes claimed are enforceable only against the land, there is no basis for the suggestion that there exists here any reason for more strenuous efforts to collect from corporations than from natural persons. \n\n[279 U.S. 692, 708]\n\u00a0\n And there is no basis for an assumption like that made in the Ft. Smith Lumber Co. Case. The classification, at least when applied to land, is fanciful and capricious. Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, \n278 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 49 S. Ct. 57, 73 L. Ed. -.\n The decree should be reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section amended section 1 of Act No. 354, p. 324 of the Acts of 1911, so as to read: 'Where the Attorney General is satisfied from his own investigations or it is made to appear to him by the statement in writing of any reputable taxpayer of the State, that in consequence of the failure from any cause to assess and levy taxes, or because of any pretended assessment and levy of taxes upon any basis of valuation other than the true value in money of any property hereinafter mentioned or because of any inadequate or insufficient valuation or assessment of such property, or undervaluation thereof, or from any other cause, that there are overdue and unpaid taxes owing to the State, or any county or municipal corporation, or road district, or school district, by any corporation upon any property now in this State which belonged to any corporation at the time such taxes should have been properly assessed and paid; that it shall become his duty to at once institute a suit or suits in chancery in the name of the State of Arkansas, for the collection of the same, in any county in which the corporation owing such taxes may be found, or in any county in which any part of such property as may be found, or in any county in which any part of such property as may have escaped the payment in whole or in part of the taxes as aforesaid may be situated . ...'

Sullivan, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Edwin C. Matthias, of Seattle, Wash., Thomas Balmer, of Spokane, Wash., and Charles S. Albert, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, a public utility corporation organized under the laws of Washington, was empowered to acquire by eminent domain the right to use the water of Lake Chelau for the generation of electricity for public use, and to that end was authorized to impound and raise the water to 1,100 feet above mean sea level. Appellant, a resident and citizen of Pennsylvania, owns shore land, a part of which is overflowed by the water so raised. Appellee instituted condemnation proceedings in the superior court of Chelan county. The petition showed that the purpose was to acquire the right so to raise the water and inundate appellant's land. Notice was published as required. And later appellee filed a bill of particulars describing by metes and bounds the land to be condemned. The court found the taking to be in the public interest, fixed compensation for appellant, and by its decree appropriated to the use of appellee the right in perpetuity to overflow such land. The judgment was affirmed in the highest court of the \n\n[280 U.S. 108, 110]\n\u00a0\n state. 145 Wash. 129, 259 P. 379; 148 Wash. 479, 269 P. 827. Appellant seeks review under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (U. S. C. tit. 28,  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a).\n Under the laws of Washington (Remington's Compiled Statutes, 1922,  921 et seq.), condemnation proceedings are instituted by the presentation of a petition to the superior court of the county in which is located the property proposed to be taken. Notice is required to be given to those interested as owners or otherwise. Section 922. The substance of the provision here attacked follows. 'In all cases where the owner ... is a nonresident of this state ... service (of the notice) may be made by publication thereof in any newspaper published in the county where such lands are situated, once a week for two successive weeks. ... And such publication shall be deemed service upon each of such nonresidents. ...' Section 922. September 22, 1926, appellee filed a notice that its petition for condemnation would be presented to the court October 11. A notice to that effect was published in a newspaper of the county on September 23, September 30, and October 7. Appellant appeared specially, objected to the jurisdiction of the court, moved to quash the service, and challenged the validity of the statute on the ground of its being repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n She says that the service was not complete until two weeks after the first publication, and, relying on Roller v. Holly, \n176 \nU.S. 398\n, 20 S. Ct. 410, insists that the time allowed is not sufficient. But the Supreme Court distinguished the Texas statute considered in that case from that of Washington now before us, construed the latter not to require publication for successive weeks and not to prescribe the period of time required to elapse between the giving of the notice and the return day, held that the first publication constituted service, and that the intervening eighteen days was sufficient. That court's construction of the state \n\n[280 U.S. 108, 111]\n\u00a0\n statute is authoritative. No discussion is required to show that the time so allowed is reasonable. There is no ground on which it may be contended that the statute as construed is repugnant to the due process clause. Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway, \n130 \nU.S. 559, 563\n, 9 S. Ct. 603; Bellingham Bay, etc., Co. v. New Whatcom, \n172 \nU.S. 314, 319\n, 19 S. Ct. 873; Ballard v. Hunter, \n204 \nU.S. 241, 254\n, 262 S., 27 S. Ct. 261; Goodrich v. Ferris, \n214 \nU.S. 71\n, 29 S. Ct. 580, dismissing an appeal from the Circuit Court of Appeals (145 F. 844) for lack of jurisdiction.\n And appellant asserts that as construed in this case the provision of section 922 requiring that the petition shall contain a description of the property proposed to be taken is also repugnant to the due process clause. But mere inspection of the petition shows that the point is utterly devoid of merit.\n No attempt was made below to draw in question the validity of any other provision of the state statutes.

Ewing and W. R. Crawford, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellants.\n Messrs. Frank L. Guerena and U. S. Webb, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By Acts approved July 11, 1916, chapter 241, 39 Stat. 355, and November 9, 1921, chapter 119, 42 Stat. 212 (23 USCA  1 et seq.), Congress provided for aid to the states in roadmaking and directed that 'all highways constructed or reconstructed \n\n[280 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n under the provisions of this act shall be free from tolls of all kinds.' 23 USCA  9. California assented to the provisions of these acts and under them received large sums of money from the United States.\n By the motor vehicle fuel tax statutes, chapter 267, Acts 1923, chapter 359, Acts 1925, and chapters 716, 795, Acts 1927, the California Legislature defined motor vehicle fuel, and directed that all distributors of it should be licensed and pay taxes to the controller of the state, amounting to three cents per gallon sold, less an allowance of 1 per centum. These statutes further provides for reimbursing purchasers of fuel not used for operating vehicles upon public highways.\n Appellants, along with thousands of other citizens and taxpayers of California, operate motor vehicles along the highways. They have procured and must hereafter procedure the necessary fuel from licensed distributors at prices enhanced by the amount of the three-cent tax.\n The original bill, filed in the District Court of the United States August 4, 1928, names as the only defendant the state controller-the officer charged with the duty of enforcing the motor vehicle fuel tax statutes. It proceeds upon the theory that those statutes, under the form of taxing dealers from whom appellants and all other operators of motor vehicles must buy, in effect exact tolls for the use of the highways, also grant certain favors to the distributors, and deprive all such purchasers of their property without due process of law. Therefore, it is said, they conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, the Federal Highway Acts, and the Constitution of California. The prayer is for a decree declaring their invalidity and for an injunction restraining defendant from attempting to enforce them, etc.\n In the court below-three judges sitting-the bill was dismissed, without written opinion.\n Appellants may not undertake to test the validity of the questioned acts by a proceeding of this character. \n\n[280 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n Frothingham v. Mellon, Sec'y of the Treasury, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 487\n, 488 S., 43 S. Ct. 597, 601, announces the applicable doctrine:\n'The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.'\n\n The federal courts have no power per se to review and annual acts of state Legislatures upon the ground that they conflict with the federal or state Constitutions. 'That question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act.'\n The decree below is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DE VANTER, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the appellants' status is such as entitles them to test the validity of the California statutes in question; that these statutes do not exact tolls for the use of highways, within the meaning of the limitation contained in the Federal Highway Acts, and are not subject to the other objections urged against them; and that for these reasons the decree below should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v.

In both the validity of a statute of Tennessee is assailed as contravening the federal Constitution. Appellee in No. 64 is a corporation organized under the laws of Louisiana, and appellee in No. 65 is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. From a time long prior to the passage of the statute, both have been engaged and are now engaged in the business of selling gasoline in the state of Tennessee.\n The statute was adopted in 1927. Its purpose and effect are to fix prices at which gasoline may be sold within the state. A division of motors and motor fuels is created in the department of finance and taxation and authorized to collect and record data concerning the manufacture and sale of gasoline, freight rates, differentials in price to wholesalers and retailers, the cost and expense of production and sale, etc. The information thus collected is made available for use by the commissioner of finance and taxation in the regulation of prices at which gasoline may be sold in the state. Permits for such sale are to be issued subject to the approval of the commissioner but only at the prices fixed and determined. Prices of gasoline are to be fixed with a proper differential between the wholesale and retail price. Rebates, price concessions, and price discrimination between persons or localities are forbidden. The prices first are to be stated by the applicant for a permit, and, if not approved by the superintendent of the division, are to be determined by that official, with a right of review by the commissioner and finally by the courts. Chapter 22, p. 53, Public Acts Tennessee 1927. By a general statute (Shannon's Tennessee Code,  6437) a violation of the act is a misdemeanor and is punishable by fine and imprisonment. Pressly v. State, 114 Tenn. 534, 538, 86 S. W. 378, 69 L. R. A. 291, 108 Am. St. Rep. 921. \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 239]\n\u00a0\n Appellees brought separate suits in the court below to enjoin the state officers named as appellants from carrying out their intention to enforce the act and institute criminal proceedings for violations of it against appellees, respectively, and to have the act declared unconstitutional and void. Under the facts alleged, the suits were properly brought. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Tyson & Brother v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 427\n, 428 S., 47 S. Ct. 426.\n The principal ground of attack, and the only one we need to consider here, is that the Legislature is without power to authorize agencies of the state to fix prices at which gasoline may be sold in the state, because the effect will be to deprive the vendors of such gasoline of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellees applied for a temporary injunction against appellants, upon which there was a hearing, and the court below, consisting of three judges (section 266, Judicial Code; 28 USCA  380), granted the injunction as prayed. 24 F.(2d) 455 (D. C.) sub nom. Standard Oil Co. v. Hall.\n It is settled by recent decisions of this court that a state Legislature is without constitutional power to fix prices at which commodities may be sold, services rendered, or property used, unless the business or property involved is 'affected with a public interest.' Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280; Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra; Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S. Ct. 506, 52 A. L. R. 163; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S. Ct. 545. Nothing is gained by reiterating the statement that the phrase is indefinite. By repeated decisions of this court, beginning with Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, that phrase, however it may be characterized, has become the established test by which the legislative power to fix prices of commodities, use of property, or services, must be measured. As applied in particular instances, its meaning may be considered both from an affirmative and a negative point of view. Affirmatively, it means that a business or property, in order to \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 240]\n\u00a0\n be affected with a public interest, must be such or be so employed as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby in effect granted to the public. Tyson & Brother v. Banton, supra, \n273 U.S. 434\n (47 S. Ct. 426). Negatively, it does not mean that a business is affected with a public interest merely because it is large or because the public are warranted in having a feeling of concern in respect of its maintenance. Id., \n273 U.S. 430\n (47 S. Ct. 426). The meaning and application of the phrase are examined at length in the Tyson Case, and we see no reason for restating what is there said.\n In support of the act under review it is urged that gasoline is of widespread use; that enormous quantities of it are sold in the state of Tennessee; and that it has become necessary and indispensable in carrying on commercial and other activities within the state. But we are here concerned with the character of the business, not with its size or the extent to which the commodity is used. Gasoline is one of the ordinary commodities of trade, differing, so far as the question here is affected, in no essential respect from a great variety of other articles commonly bought and sold by merchants and private dealers in the country. The decisions referred to above make it perfectly clear that the business of dealing in such articles, irrespective of its extent, does not come within the phrase 'affected with a public interest.' Those decisions control the present case.\n There is nothing in the point that the act in question may be justified on the ground that the sale of gasoline in Tennessee is monopolized by appellees, or by either of them, because, objections to the materiality of the contention aside, an inspection of the pleadings and of the affidavits submitted to the lower court discloses an utter failure to show the existence of such monopoly.\n Nor need we stop to consider the further contention that appellees, being foreign corporations, may not carry on \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 241]\n\u00a0\n their business within the state except by complying with the conditions prescribed by the state. While that is the general rule, a well-settled limitation upon it is that the state may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. Frost Trucking Co. v. R. Com., \n271 U.S. 583\n, 593, et seq., 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457, where the applicable decisions of this court are reviewed.\n Finally, it is said that even if the price-fixing provisions be held invalid other provisions of the act should be upheld as separate and distinct. This contention is emphasized by a reference to section 12 of the act, which declares: 'That if any section or provision of this act shall be held to be invalid this shall not affect the validity of other sections or provisions hereof.'\n In Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 71\n, 42 S. Ct. 453, 459 (66 L. Ed. 822), it is said that such a legislative declaration serves to assure the courts that separate sections or provisions of a partly invalid act may be properly sustained 'without hesitation or doubt as to whether they would have been adopted, even if the Legislature had been advised of the invalidity of part.' But the general rule is that the unobjectionable part of a statute cannot be held separable unless it appears that, 'standing alone, legal effect can be given to it and that the Legislature intended the provision to stand, in case others included in the act and held bad should fall.' The question is one of interpretation and of legislative intent, and the legislative declaration 'provides a rule of construction which may sometimes aid in determining that intent. But it is an aid merely; not an inexorable command.' Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 44 S. Ct. 323, 325 (68 L. Ed. 686).\n In the absence of such a legislative declaration, the presumption is that the Legislature intends an act to be effective as an entirety. This is well stated in Riccio v. Hoboken, 69 N. J. Law, 649, 662, 55 A. 1109, 1113 (63 L. R. A. 485) where the New Jersey Court \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 242]\n\u00a0\n of Errors and Appeals, in an opinion delivered by Judge Pitney (afterward a justice of this court), after setting forth the rule as above, said:\n'In seeking the legislative intent, the presumption is against any mutilation of a statute, and the courts will resort to elimination only where an unconstitutional provision is interjected into a statute otherwise valid, and is so independent and separable that its removal will leave the constitutional features and purposes of the act substantially unaffected by the process.'\n\n Compare Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. McKendree, \n203 U.S. 514\n, 528-530, 27 S.Ct. 153; Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 \nU.S. 463, 501\n, 28 S. Ct. 141; Butts v. Merchants' Transportation Co., \n230 U.S. 126\n, 132, et seq., 33 S. Ct. 964; and see 1 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) 362, 363, and note.\n The effect of the statutory declaration is to create in the place of the presumption just stated the opposite one of separability; that is to say, we begin, in the light of the declaration, with the presumption that the Legislature intended the act to be divisible, and this presumption must be overcome by considerations which make evident the inseparability of its provisions or the clear probability that the invalid part being eliminated the Legislature would not have been satisfied with what remains.\n In the present case, it requires no extended argument to overcome the presumption and to demonstrate the indivisible character of the act under consideration. The particular parts of the act sought to be saved are found in sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10. Section 1, after a preamble in respect of the importance of controlling the sale of gasoline and a declaration that such sale is impressed with a public use, creates the division of motors and motor fuels as already stated. Section 2 requires the superintendent of the division and other employees to make investigations, collect and record data concerning the manufacture and sale of gasoline, the cost of refining, freight rates, differ \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 243]\n\u00a0\n entials in wholesale and retail prices, costs and expenses incident to the sale, methods employed in the distribution of gasoline, and other data and information as may be material in ascertaining and determining fair and reasonable prices to be paid for gasoline. This information is declared to be available for use in the regulation of prices and for the inspection and information of the public. The superintendent is directed to issue permits for the sale of gasoline at prices fixed and determined as provided in other parts of the statute. Section 3 makes it unlawful for anyone to engage in the sale of gasoline without first having obtained a permit signed by the superintendent and approved by the commissioner of finance and taxation, for which permit application must be made in accordance with and in compliance with all the requirements of the act. Section 4 requires that the application shall set forth whether the applicant proposes to do a wholesale or retail business, or both, the number and location of the different places where he is to operate and other like information. He must also set forth the price or prices at which he is at the time selling gasoline, the cost price thereof, including various items which enter into the price, and the price at which he proposes to sell. Section 10 imposes a special permit tax of $10 per annum for each place of sale at wholesale, and $1 per annum for each retail service station or curb pump. The tax thus imposed is constituted a special maintenance fund to aid in defraying the expenses of the division of motors and motor fuels.\n The bare recital of these details shows conclusively that they are mere adjuncts of the price-fixing provisions of the law or mere aids to their effective execution. The function of the division created by section 1 is to carry these provisions into effect, and if they be stricken down as invalid the existence of the division becomes without object. The purpose of collection the data set forth in section 2 is to \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 244]\n\u00a0\n furnish information to aid in the fixing of proper prices. The requirements in section 3 that a permit must be obtained before any person can engage in the business of selling gasoline and those in section 4 that the application therefor must state the character of the business, the number and location of the places where business is to be carried on, the price or prices at which the applicant is then selling gasoline, the cost price thereof, and the price at which he proposes to sell, obviously constitute data for intelligently putting into effect the price-fixing provisions of the law or means to that end. The taxes imposed by section 10 are solely for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the division of motors and motor fuels, and since the functions of that division practically come to an end with the failure of the price-fixing features of the law, it is unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature would be willing to authorize the collection of a fund for a use which no longer exists.\n Appellants also insist that certain provisions in respect of rebating and discrimination contained in section 8 of the act are separable. Those provisions are that it shall be unlawful to grant any rebate, concession, or gratuity to any purchaser for the purpose or inducing the purchaser to purchase, use, or handle the gasoline of the particular dealer, and that it shall likewise be unlawful to discriminate for or against any purchaser by selling at different prices to purchasers in the same locality or in different localities. It seems clear that these provisions are mere appendants in aid of the main purpose; but, if treated as separable, they are unconstitutional restrictions upon the right of the private dealer to fix his own prices and fall within the principle of the decisions already cited. See especially Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, supra.\n This interpretation of the various provisions of the act is fortified by a requirement of the Tennessee Constitution (article 2,  17) that 'no bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject, that subject to be \n\n[278 U.S. 235, 245]\n\u00a0\n expressed in the title.' It is fair to conclude, and there is nothing to suggest the contrary, that in the passage of the present act the Legislature intended to observe this requirement and confine the provisions of the act to the one subject of price-fixing.\n Accordingly, we must hold that the object of the statute under review was to accomplish the single general purpose which we have stated, and, that purpose failing for want of constitutional power to effect it, the remaining portions of the act, serving merely to facilitate or contribute to the consummation of the purpose, must likewise fall.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissents.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWISCONSIN v.
